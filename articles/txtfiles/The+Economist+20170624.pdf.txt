The pastthree years ap-pearto have settled the matter.Yes, MrModi haspandered to religioussentimentattimes,mostnotablybyappointinga rabble-rousingHinduprelate aschiefministerofIndia’smost-populousstate, UttarPradesh.Buthe hasalso presided overan acceleration in economicgrowth, from 6.4% in 2013 to a high of7.9% in 2015—which madeIndia the fastest-growingbigeconomyin the world. He haspushed through reformsthathad stalled foryears, includingan overhaul ofbankruptcylawand the adoption ofa nation-wide salestax(GST) to replace a confusingarrayoflocal andnational levies. Foreign investmenthassoared, albeit from alowbase. India, cabinetministersinsist, isatlast becomingthetigerMrModi promised.Alas, these appearancesare deceiving(see page 18). TheGST, although welcome, isunnecessarilycomplicated and bu-reaucratic, greatlyreducingitseﬃciency. The newbankruptcylawisa step in the rightdirection, butitwill take much more torevive the ﬁnancial system, which isdominated bystate-owned banksweighed down bydud loans. The central gov-ernment’sresponse to a hostofpressingeconomicproblems,from the diﬃcultyofbuyingland to the reform ofrigid labourlaws, hasbeen to passthem to the states. And atleast one ofthebigreformsithasundertaken—the overnightcancellation ofmostofIndia’sbanknotesin an eﬀortto curb the black econ-omy—wascounterproductive, hamstringinglegitimate busi-nesseswithoutdoingmuch harm to illicitones. No wonderthe economyisstartingto drag. In the ﬁrstthree months oftheyearitgrewatan annualised rate of6.1%, more slowlythanwhen MrModi came to power.More an administratorthan a reformerIndia’sprime minister, in short, isnotthe radical reformer he iscracked up to be. He ismore energeticthan hispredecessor, thestatelyManmohan Singh, launchingglitzyinitiativeson every-thingfrom manufacturingto toilet-construction. Buthe hasnotcome up with manybignewideasofhisown (the GSTandthe bankruptcyreformsdate backlongbefore histime). Hisreputation asa friend to businessrestson hisvigorous eﬀortsto help ﬁrmsoutofﬁxes—ﬁndingland fora particular factory,say, orexpeditingthe construction ofa powerstation. Buthe isnotso good atworkingsystematicallyto sortoutthe underly-ingproblemsholdingthe economyback.India doesnotjustneed powerstationsand parcels oflandfordevelopment. Itneedsfunctioningmarketsforelectricityand land—and capital and labour, forthatmatter. Lending toindustryiscontracting, forthe ﬁrsttime in 20 years; MrModishould recapitalise state-owned banksand sell them oﬀ, to getloansﬂowingagain. He should be workingto simplify theover-exactinglabourlaw, which perverselyharmsworkers bydeterringcompaniesfrom hiringthem formally. Property pur-chasesare a forbiddingquagmire; the government, ata mini-mum, should tryto improve the qualityofregistersto reducethe scope fordisputes.Political conditionsare aboutaspropitiousforreform astheyare everlikelyto be. MrModi’sgovernmentisthe stron-gestin decades. Ithasa bigmajorityin the lowerhouse ofpar-liamentand isedgingcloserto control ofthe upperhouse, aswell. Itrunsmostbigstates. The opposition ishopeless.There are economictailwinds, too. India isa bigimporter ofoil; the lowprice oflate hasbeen boostinggrowth by perhapstwo percentage pointsa year. Ageinghaslongweighed onWestern economiesand isstartingto sap China’s. India, bycontrast, isstill young. Overa quarterofthe people joiningtheworld’sworkforce between nowand 2025 will be Indian. Andthere isenormousscope forcatch-up growth: India is the poor-estofthe world’s20 biggesteconomies. Byrights, itshould besurpassingothers’ growth ratesforyears. MrModi, in short, issquanderinga golden opportunity.Some apologistsclaim thathe iswaitinguntil he wins a major-ityin the upperhouse before takingon biggerreforms. Ifso, hehasgiven no inklingofwhathe isplanning. In fact, he hasnoteven made clearthateconomicreform ishispriority.More a chauvinistthan an economistAsprime minister, MrModi hasbeen justascareful to courtmilitantHindusasjet-settingbusinessmen. Hisgovernmentrecentlycreated havocin the boomingbeef-exportbusinesswith onerousnewruleson purchasesofcattle, in deference toHindus’ reverence forcows(see page 54). Yogi Adityanath, theman he selected to run UttarPradesh, isunderinvestigation forincitingreligioushatred and rioting, amongotheroﬀences.The fearisthat, ifthe economyfalters, MrModi will trytomaintain hispopularitybystirringup communal tensions.That, afterall, ishowhisBharatiya Janata Partyﬁrst propelleditselfto governmentin the 1990s. MrModi himselfwaschiefministerofGujaratin 2002 when riotingthere killed atleast1,000 people, mostofthem Muslims. To thisday, he has nevercategoricallycondemned the massacre orapologised for fail-ingto preventit.UnderMrModi, debate aboutpublicpolicy, and especiallyaboutcommunal relations, hasatrophied (see page 21). Hindunationalistthugsintimidate those who chide the governmentforstrayingfrom India’sseculartradition, orwho advocate alessrepressive approach to protestsin Kashmir, India’sonlystate with a Muslim majority. One ofthe fewmedia compan-iesthatdaresto criticise the governmenthasbeen raided bypolice on groundsthatwould notnormallyattractsuch heavy-handedness. MrModi himselfhasbecome the objectofa syco-phanticpersonalitycult. The prime ministermayintend allthisasa wayto keep winningelections. Butitisnot hard toimagine itgoingdisastrouslywrong.MrModi’sadmirerspainthim asthe man who atlast un-leashed India’spotential.

Deadlyattacksby, and thisweekagainst, Muslimshaveshattered the beliefthatthe se-curityservicescan shield Britainfrom the terrorism aﬄicting thecontinent. Aminoritygovern-menthastaken oﬃce undera prime ministerwho hasno au-thority, usheringin chronicinstability. And, asifto symbolise itall, an inferno atthe Grenfell Towerin London’srichestbor-ough claimed atleast79 livesofitspoorestresidents. Britonsare searchingfora moral thatmeasuresup to the catastrophe.Manypossible moralshave been overblown, sometimes tothe pointofexploitation. Capitalism hasnotfailed. Britain’stall buildingsshould not, assome say, be branded unﬁt forhu-man habitation—butbe made saferinstead (see page 50). Theﬁre atGrenfell Towerwasnotthe faultofEuropean Union reg-ulation: othercountriesban the exteriorcladdingthat isthoughtto have spread it, asBritain claimsto fortall buildings.Thiswasnotan indictmentofprivate propertyora justiﬁca-tion forexpropriatingnearbyhouses, howeverrich their own-ers. Itwasa momentforpeople to take care ofgrieving neigh-boursmade homeless. Norwasitan argumentagainstderegulation. Havingtoo manyrulesleadsto a culture ofnon-compliance thatiseverybitaslethal ashavingtoo few. And itdoesnotmean thatpublicworksshould neverbe putout totender. Run well, contractsuse competition to raise standards. The mostimportantlesson ofthe pastfewweeksisless far-reaching. Britonsare tired ofausterity(see page 47). In the elec-tion campaign, Labour’spromise ofgreatlyincreased publicspendingappealed to voterswho have feltTorycutsbegin tobite. When JeremyCorbyn, Labour’sleader, blamed terrorismon police cuts, manypeople agreed with him. And the com-plaintsthathithome mostdeeplyafterGrenfell Tower werethatthe buildinghad been clad on the cheap, thatthe localcouncil had no capacityto respond to the disasterand thataus-terityhasbeen imposed forlongerand more harshlyon thepoor—the verypeople who lived in the tower. Thathastwo implications. The ﬁrstishowa focus on pay-ingforpublicserviceswill aﬀectthe issue thatwill dominatethisparliament. In settingoutheraimsforthe Brexit negotia-tions, which gotunderwaythisweek, Theresa Maymade con-trollingimmigration a priority. Everythingﬂowed from herin-sistence thatBritain had to getimmigration down to 100,000orfewer, ideallywithin the nextﬁve years. Yet, if limitingaus-terityisnowthe aim, immigration mustfall rightdown the list.Instead, Brexitshould be aboutdoingthe bestforthe econ-omy—asthe chancellor, Philip Hammond, said thisweek (seeBagehot). Beingopen to immigration makesa compromiseoveraccessto EUmarketseasierand boostsgrowth directly.Atime forhonestyThe second implication isthatBritain needsa debate aboutthebalance between publicservicesand taxes. Atthe moment,votersdemand standardsofhealth care, education and localgovernmentforwhich theyseem unwillingto pay. MrCorbynpromised thatsomeone else will do so: the veryrich and com-panies. Butthe veryrich will leave the countryand companieswill passtaxeson to citizens. An honestdebate would focusnotonlyon taxratesbutalso on value formoney. It mightin-volve more eﬃcientregulation and outsourcingservices thatcan be bettersupplied byprivate ﬁrms—the thingsthe rushers-to-judgmentcondemned afterGrenfell. Do notimagine thatthisdebate will be easyorcivilised. Itwill be foughton the picketline and in the streetas well asinParliament. Butitmusttake place, and itsoutcome will deter-mine Britain’spath foryearsto come. 7Divided BritainThe towerand the angerAhorriﬁcLondon ﬁre raises more questions forTheresa May’s embattled governmentMITCH McCONNELL, theleaderofthe Republicanmajorityin the Senate, oncecomplained thatPresidentBa-rackObama’shealth-care billwasthrown togetherin a backroom and then dropped on theSenate ﬂoor“with a stopwatchrunning”. Nowhe hasmade the tactichisown. MrMcConnellhopesto call a vote on a health-care bill thatwill have barelyleftthe printer’s. Aweekbefore a vote thatcould remake asixth ofthe economy, even manyRepublican senatorsclaimnotto knowwhatthe bill contains.Whythe hush, hurryand hypocrisy? MrMcConnell wantsto minimise the opportunityforcriticsto campaign against hisproposals. When the House ofRepresentativesconsidered itsbill thisyear, the schedule wasunusuallytight. But there wasstill enough time forangryproteststo spooksome Republicancongressmen. The bill wasdelayed. Eventuallyitpassed after aminoramendmentmade a small concession to itscritics. Re-publican senators, eagerto move on to taxreform, do notwantmore delaysbefore they“repeal and replace” Obamacare. Iftheypassa bill before a recess, neitherconstituents noranyoneelse will have much ofa chance to rallyopposition to it.The Senate mayonlytweakthe House bill. Ifso, Republi-canswill argue thattheirideashave alreadyreceived plentyof American health careSunlightneededAmerican health insuranceNumber of people without cover, m020406020001015052026ActualCurrent lawFORECASTHouse planRushing through sweeping health-care reform withoutscrutinywould be reckless and undemocraticThe EconomistJune24th2017 Leaders1112publicattention—exceptthattheirideashave notwithstoodscrutiny. JustaskPresidentDonald Trump who, having cele-brated the House bill’spassage in the Rose Garden, nowsaysthatitistoo mean. The bill would graduallyunwind the expan-sion ofMedicaid, health insurance forthe poor, which isre-sponsible forprovidingan additional 12m Americanswithcover. Itwould repeal taxincreases, mostlyforthe rich, thatpaid forthisexpansion. And itwould give statesthe rightto optoutofsome ofObamacare’sregulations. Forinstance, statescould letinsurerscap the amountofcare theywill fund duringanyone patient’slifetime, a practice thatisbanned today. The justiﬁcation forthisisrooted in sound federalism: theidea thatstates, notWashington, should write policy whenpossible. Republicanspointto real problemswith Medicaid,which isstructured to encourage wasteful spending. They alsoidentifytrouble with Obamacare’sinsurance markets, whichhave been plagued byrisingpremiumsand the departure ofinsurers(though the Trump administration isto blame forthelatestpalpitations, because ithasthreatened to cut oﬀpay-mentsto insurersthatare crucial to Obamacare’sdesign).Yetmore federalism in health care would lead to manystatesleavingthe poorand sickwithoutdecentcoverage.Americansrightlythinkthatwould be intolerable in a richcountry. Sixin ten saythatthe federal governmentshouldmake sure everyone iscovered. Republicanschoose not to con-testthe point. Instead, theypromise vaguelythateveryonewill have “accessto” insurance—a bitlike sayingeveryone canhave accessto champagne, so longastheycan aﬀord it. TomPrice, the health secretary, haseven denied thatthe House billwill reduce Medicaid coverage, perhapsbecause the presidentpromised to leave Medicaid alone duringhiscampaign. Republicanssaythatfederal regulationsunfairlyrestrictconsumerchoice. Butthe realityofinsurance markets isthat,when possible, ﬁrmswill design policiesso asto attract onlylow-riskcustomers. Obamacare’sregulationsstop those withchronicconditions, such asHIVordiabetes, from beingpricedoutofthe market. Like the goal ofuniversal coverage, theseprotectionsare popular.

He mayformallyhavebeen second in the line ofsuc-cession, butMuhammad binSalman (known asMBS) ranmostofthe thingsthatmattered: the plan to transform the Sau-di state and wean the economyawayfrom oil; the warin Ye-men and the widercontestagainstShia Iran; and much else be-sides. When he gave hisﬁrston-the-record interview, to TheEconomistin January2016, MBS spoke aboutSaudi Arabia inthe ﬁrstperson—talkingof“myborders”.On the face ofit, the elevation ofMBS to crown prince, re-placinghisoldercousin, Muhammad bin Nayef, meansonlythathisjob title hascaughtup with reality(see page 38). Yetitrewritesthe kingdom’sstrange rulesofsuccession. Whereaspoweronce passed alongthe line ofageingsonsofKing AbdelAzizAl Saud, the state’sfounder, itnowgoesdown the bloodline ofKingSalman. No one would be surprised ifSalman,who is81, were to abdicate in favourofhis31-year-old heir.Thatthe old brothersare no longerup to the taskof runningthe kingdom isnotin doubt. Saudi Arabia mustprepare itsyouthful population (70% ofSaudisare under30) fora fast-changingworld in which theywill have to workfora living.Oil islikelyto remain cheap fora longtime, the politics ofreli-gion are tearingatthe region, and manyArab stateshave col-lapsed into civil war. Yetrule bya callow, hot-headed princecould be justasdangerousasstagnation undera gerontocracy.Intelligent, ambitiousand willingto entertain new ideas,MBS showsmuch promise, buta worryingtendencyto actrashly. Abroad, he pushed hiscountryto intervene in Yemen’scivil war. Thisisnowin itsthird yearand hasreached a grimstalemate; Yemenis, alreadythe poorestArab nation, have be-come even more wretched through bloodshed, hungeranddisease. MBSisalso thoughtto be behind the recentdiplomaticassaulton Qatar. Saudi Arabia and several Arab countrieshave cutland, sea and airlinkswith the emirate, on vague ac-cusationsthatitsupportsterrorism (a charge often levelled atthe Saudis, too).Athome, MBSpresidesovera countrystill too dependenton hydrocarbons. Hisgamble ofallowingoil pricesto fall todrive outhigh-costproducersfailed. More recently, an attemptto supportpricesbyco-ordinated production cutshas notworked either.

Hisplan, known asSaudi Vision 2030, isaradical programme ofprivatisation (cutsin subsidies and in-vestmentsin non-oil industries). The ﬁrstreallybig step issup-posed to be the sale of5% ofthe sharesin Saudi Aramco, theworld’slargestoil company(see page 52).

Faced with a backlash, the prince has revokedcutsin allowancesand bonusesforcivil servants; soldiersﬁghtingin Yemen were given a two-month paybonus. Someprincesnowmockinglycall MBS al-walad(the boy). Despitethese diﬃculties, orperhapsbecause ofthem, MBS ishurryingto consolidate hispower. He mayfeel encouraged bythegung-ho waythatPresidentDonald Trump hasaligned Amer-ica with Saudi interests, asdeﬁned byMBS, supportingthe iso-lation ofQataragainstthe betterjudgmentofRexTillersonand JamesMattis, the secretariesofstate and defence.Saudi Arabia mattersimmensely, both asa swingproducerofoil and asthe birthplace ofIslam.

MBSshould sharesome powerwith modernisingprinces, while checkingthe ex-cessesofreligiousreactionariesand the sprawlingroyal family.He should relaxstrictsocial controls, particularlyon women,and encourage more debate and dissent. He should halt thepointlessrowwith Qatar, and seeka political deal to end thewarin Yemen. Thatwayhe can focuson hisbiggesttask: turn-inghiscountry’srentiereconomyinto somethingmore dy-namic. Havingcreated a huge job forhimself, MBS will bejudged on whetherhe createslotsofjobsforyoungSaudis. 7IN1989, duringthe dyingdaysofthe SovietUnion, a long-haired 26-year-old dissidentcalled ViktorOrban addressed acrowd in Budapest’sHeroes’Square. The charismaticyoungliberal told the Russiansto with-drawfrom Hungary. He rejected“the dictatorship ofa single party”. He called forfree elections. Howthingschange. TodayMrOrban, Hungary’sprimeminister, isone ofVladimirPutin’sclosestfriendsin Europe.Hiscountryisincreasinglydominated byone party, his own.Electionsmaybe free, buttheyare notfair. MrOrban hasre-written the constitution, dismantled checksand balances (“aUSinvention” unsuited to Europe, he says), muzzled the pressand empowered oligarchs. Refugees, who supposedlythreat-en Hungary’sChristian identity, are beaten bypolice andmauled bypolice dogs. Debatesovervalues, MrOrban thinks,“unnecessarilygenerate social problems”. He wantsto fashionan “illiberal state” modelled on China, Russia and Turkey. MrOrban hasrecentlyescalated hisattackon Hungary’sre-mainingindependentinstitutions(see page 42). In April his Fi-deszpartypassed a lawthatthreatensto close the respectedCentral European Universityin Budapest, which wasfoundedbyGeorge Soros, a Hungarian-American philanthropistwhom MrOrban detests. Lastweekthe governmentpassed alawto force NGOsto disclose whethertheyreceive foreignfunds.MrOrban’screepingauthoritarianism isnotjust a pro-blem forHungary. Itisa directchallenge to the “fundamentalvalues” ofthe European project—valuesthatHungaryaccept-ed when itratiﬁed the Lisbon treaty. Where Hungaryleads,othersmayfollow; Poland alreadyhas. “We were blacksheep,butnowwe are a successstory,” MrOrban crowed afterthe in-auguration ofDonald Trump, whose nationalism he admires. Fortoo long, the EUhasturned a blind eye to MrOrban’sex-cesses. Happily, thatmayatlastbe changing.

When courtingvotershe talked tantalisinglyaboutrelin-quishingthe commandingheightsoftheeconomyto the private sector. “I believethatgovernmenthasno businessto be inbusiness,” he proclaimed.

Meanwhile, onlya tinyminor-ityofstaﬀwho are formallyemployed byregistered ﬁrmsactuallybeneﬁtfrom theproﬀered workers’ rights.More fundamentally, India lacksthe ca-pable and healthyworkforce itneedstothrive. Educational standardsare woefulbutthe governmenthasdone little tochange a system where teachersbribetheirwayinto jobsfrom which theycanneverbe ﬁred.

Late lastmonth itshighestcourt ruledthatthe lawallowingmarriage onlybetween a man and awoman wasinvalid. Sexual orientation, itsaid, is“an immutablecharacteristicthatisresistantto change”—rebuttinga widespreadviewacrossAsia thathomosexualityisa curable disease. Barringsame-sexcouplesfrom marryingviolated the rightto be treatedequally, the courtconcluded. Itgave parliamenttwo years tochange the law. Ifitfailsto do so, gaycoupleswill be able to goahead and registerasmarried anyway.ForChi Chia-wei, the case’smostardentbacker, ithasbeen alongﬁght. He wasa teenagerwhen he came outto hisfamily in1975. When he made a publicdeclaration ofhishomosexuality in1986, Taiwan wasstill undermartial law; he wasarrested andjailed. Nineteen yearsafterthe Netherlandsbecame the ﬁrstcountryto legalise same-sexmarriage, Taiwan hasbecome theﬁrstin Asia. Which will be second?CertainlynotAfghanistan, where sexual actsbetween menare punishable bydeath. Indonesia doesnothave a national lawagainstsodomy. Butthatdid nothelp two youngmen caught byvigilanteshavingsexin Aceh province, which wasallowed toadoptsharia lawin 2001aspartofa deal to end an insurgency.Theywere whipped in public, asa crowd jeered and ﬁlmed thespectacle on theirsmartphones. Amemberofthe Acehnese cler-ics’ council told the crowd thatthe caningswere thoughtful, edu-cational and “do notviolate human rights”.The waygaypeople are treated in Asia isconfusingly diverse.Three main factorsaﬀectit. The ﬁrstisthe degree of civicfreedomajurisdiction enjoys, in the form ofa thrivingdemocracy and astrongcivil society. The second isthe degree ofsocial open-ness—ie, howacceptingissocietyofsexual minorities? Lastcomesreligioustolerance: howaggressivelydo religious institu-tionsobjectto deviation from sexual norms?Itisnothard, therefore, to understand whyAfghanistan issuch an awful place to be gay. Civil societyremainsfragile or, inTaliban-controlled areas, non-existent. Societyislargely gov-erned bytraditional norms. And Afghan clericsare ﬁercely con-servative. Bycontrast, Thailand maybe sociallyaccepting, butthegeneralshave hollowed outpoliticsand pinioned civil society.Taiwan scoresstronglyin two areas. Itscivil society isAsia’smostvibrant, and social acceptance ofgayshasgrown rapidly inrecentyears. In 2001nearlythree-ﬁfthsofTaiwanese were againstsame-sexmarriage. Today, pollssuggestthathalfsupport it, andanotherquarterdo nothave strongviews. Yeteven in Taiwan, ac-knowledgingsame-sexrelationshipsfaced resistance. Christiangroupshelped to stall a bill bythreateningto turfout anylegisla-torwho favoured gaymarriage. Taiwan’spresident, Tsai Ing-wen,wasan advocate ofgayrightson the campaign trail but istimidon the subjectin oﬃce.Even strongerChristian conservatism coloursanotherex-dic-tatorship with a vigorouscivil society: South Korea. There, na-tional securityisused to justifysome illiberal impulses. Civilianlawprotectsgaysfrom discrimination, butin the armed forces,where there isconscription, sexual relationsbetween men aredeemed to be “reciprocal rape” and subjectto up to two years inprison. Lastmonth a captain broke down in the dockafter beinggiven a suspended six-month sentence. Human-rightsgroups ac-cuse the armyof“huntingdown” gaysoldiers—more than 30have been investigated thisyear. Almostthree-quarters ofSouthKoreansin their20ssee gayissuesasa matterofhuman rights,and manyhave protested againstthe army’sactions. Buttheir el-dersremain conservative. South Korea’snewpresident, MoonJae-in, although a progressive in otherrespects, said in a presiden-tial debate thathe “opposed” homosexuality.Some thinkSingapore maybe numbertwo. In nine years at-tendance atitsannual “PinkDot” eventhasswollen from 2,500 toperhaps30,000. GaySingaporeansbringrelativesalong, and theinvolvementofnon-gaygroups, saysPaerin Choa, a lawyer andone ofthe organisers, doesa lotforthe cause. Singaporean busi-nessesare increasinglyopen-minded. Afterthe governmentruled thatforeign ﬁrmscould notsponsorpolitical rallies, 120 lo-cal onesreplaced the donationsthatmultinationalshad previ-ouslymade. Yetsexbetween men remainsillegal undersection377Aofthe penal code. Countingas“outrageson decency”, itissandwiched between “sexual penetration ofa corpse” and “sex-ual penetration with livinganimal”. Whatismore, religiouscon-servativesagitate againsta reviewofthe code. DisapprovingChristiansand Muslimsmeeton a Facebookpage called “We areAgainstPinkDotin Singapore”—an unusual union in itself.India, the biggestdemocracy, will win no prizes, having a con-servative society, a Hindu-nationalistpartyin powerand a colo-nial-era lawagainstgaysexalmostidentical to Singapore’s.

Alackofconﬁdence in HongKong’sfuture had prompted a rush to ob-tain full British orotherWestern passportsand to ﬁnd boltholesabroad. Yetasthe handoverdate approached, agenerallypositive mood prevailed amongordinarycitizens. Opinion pollingbyHongKongUniversityshowed twice asmanypeople satisﬁed with theirlives asnot. Afterall, China’seconomywasbegin-ningto take oﬀ. Indeed the whole regionwasbooming. HongKongseemed extraor-dinarilywell-placed to beneﬁt. Early im-pressionsofChinese rule reinforced opti-mism.

To date, the tenures ofallchiefexecutiveshave ended in ignominyorfailure. The governmenthasbeen reluc-tantto fosterchange.

Ithasdone neither.In oﬃce, MrsLam will struggle to breakwith thislegacy. Though a hard-workingbureaucrat, hercosyrelationswith the cen-tral governmentundermine hercredibilitylocally. She isprone to curiousgaﬀes, suchasadmittingshe did notknowwhere tobuylavatorypaper. Above all, she is strug-glingto bringtogethera competentadmin-istration.

Manyin the democraticcamp see the creepingarm ofthe LiaisonOﬃce, HongKong’s“second team”, asabreach ofChina’spromisesto HongKong—and a possible conduitformainland-stylecorruption. Forthose HongKongerswith the terri-tory’sinterestsatheart, the past20 yearsof-fersome lessons. One isthatforall theCommunistParty’smight, and a wantofdemocraticrepresentation, popularopin-ion—stronglyexpressed—countsforsome-thing. MrTung’sattemptto passan anti-subversion lawdemanded bythe centralgovernmentled to huge protestsin 2003,the bill’sshelving, and MrTung’seventualresignation. Protestsin 2012 stopped amove to foiston schoolsa programme ofCommunist-inspired patrioticeducation.And even though MrLeungpatientlyworedown the Umbrella protestsbyrefusing tomake concessions, hisactionsfostered ayoungergeneration ofpolitical activists,manyofthem teenagers. Thatgenerationidentiﬁesfarlesswith the mainland thando those who witnessed the handover. Localism mayhelp to preserve some ofwhatmakesHongKongdistinct, butits riseiscreatingfracturesin the pro-democracycamp. Underpressure from localistradi-cals, moderatesare ﬁndingitmore diﬃcultto compromise with the government.Hence theirrejection ofa political-reformpackage in 2014 thatwould have alloweduniversal suﬀrage in choosingthe chief ex-ecutive, butwith onlyvetted candidatesrunning. Localism hasalso encouragedhardlinersin Beijingto treatthe territory asapotential political threat.

Nathan Law,an advocate ofself-determination who at23 isLegco’syoungestmember, pointsoutthat20 yearssince the handoverisalso just30 yearsuntil July1st2047, when all formalpromisesaboutHongKong’sautonomyare void. In Maylastyear, protesters dis-played a countdown in secondsto thatdate on HongKong’stallestskyscraper; seepicture below. To MrLaw’sgeneration, hesays, 2047 isnotfaraway; he will still be inhisprime. Itiswhy, he argues, there isall toplayfornow.The CommunistPartyand itsHongKongbackersare clearabouthowto playthe game: restrain democracyand tryto ex-clude from electionsanycandidate theydeem to be sympatheticto independence.Chinese oﬃcialshave been makingit clearto MrsLam thattheywantthe shelvedanti-subversion bill to be revived; as theysee it, such a lawwould be a useful weap-on againstseparatists.

Ifthe administration isto be be-lieved, thisisjustone ofmanyprivatisa-tionsthatcould increase eﬃciencyand en-courage infrastructure investment. Couldsuch a national sell-oﬀwork?Unlike much ofthe world, America hasneverseen a bigpush to privatise. That ispartlybecause America did notsee a waveofnationalisationsafterthe second worldwar, ascountrieslike Britain did.

AnotheristheTennessee ValleyAuthority, a publicelec-trical utilityestablished asan economicdevelopmentprojectafterthe GreatDe-pression. (PresidentObama entertainedprivatisingthe TVAduringhissecond term,butdid notgetround to it.) YetAmerica ishardlyatthe forefront ofprivate infrastructure ownership, either.

In 2008Chicago leased itsparkingmetersto a con-sortium for75 yearsfor$1.2bn, a price thatwasalmost$1bn too low, accordingto a re-portbythe city’sinspector-general.

Inrecentyearsthe justiceshave crackeddown on electoral districtsdrawn bypoli-ticiansalongracial lines. Arulingin 2015held thatAlabama had violated the 14thAmendment’sequal-protection guaranteebypackingtoo manyblackvotersinto stateelectoral districts, dilutingtheirinﬂuencein neighbouringareas. Lastmonth, in Coo-pervHarris, the courtreprimanded NorthCarolina fordoingthe same in two legisla-tive districts. Butthe justiceshave lookedthe otherwaywhen districtsare drawnwith partyadvantage ratherthan race inmind. Partisan gerrymanderingmaybe“unsavoury”, asJustice Samuel Alito putsit, butithasnotyetbeen held to oﬀendagainstthe constitution.Gill vWhitford, one ofthe mostimpor-tantcasesthe justiceswill hearnext term,callsJustice Alito’sviewinto question. Thetimingiskey. With the 2020 censusroundthe corner, newelectoral mapswill soonbe on the draughtsman’stable. Ifthe chal-lenge to hyper-partisan line-drawingsuc-ceeds, itcould tighten the linkbetween vot-erpreferencesand who getselected.America hasstrayed furtherfrom thisideal in recentyears, and itismainlyDemocratswho have suﬀered asa result.Afteran electoral surge in 2010, Republi-cansused theirnew-found control ofstatelegislaturesand governor’smansionsto re-drawdistrictboundaries. In racesfor theHouse ofRepresentativesin 2012, well over1m more votersopted forDemocrats, butRepublicanswound up with a 234-201ma-jority. The phenomenon waseven morepronounced in state elections. In Wiscon-sin 51% ofvoterspicked Democratsin the2012 state legislative contests, butRepubli-canstook60 ofthe 99 Assemblyseats.Democratstend to bunch togetherin citiesanyway, butpartisan gerrymanderscanmake theirunder-representation worse.The plaintiﬀsin Gillsaythese skewedoutcomesstem from “pinpoint-precisiontechnologythatsliced-and-diced Ameri-can communities.” REDMAP, asthe Repub-lican redistrictingprogramme wascalled,did notconceal itsgoal to “maintain a Re-publican stronghold in the USHouse ofRepresentativesforthe nextdecade”. Untilnow, thisstrategyhasbeen constitution-allykosher. In 1986, the Supreme Courtturned backa challenge to partisan line-drawing. Eighteen yearslater, fourjusticesinsisted itwasimpossible to determinewhen politicallymotivated district-draw-ingcrossed a constitutional line, while thefourliberal justiceseach ﬂoated a standardfordoingjustthat. The decisive vote camefrom Justice AnthonyKennedy, to this daythe court’scentre ofgravity, who rejectedeach ofthe liberals’ proposalsbutrefusedto give up hope thatone day, in anothercase, a red line mightbe found.EricMcGhee, a political scientist, andNicholasStephanopoulos, a lawprofessorwho isadvisingthe plaintiﬀs, think theyhave found whatJustice Kennedywanted:awayofmeasuringthe extentofthe parti-san imbalance. In all elections, the losingcandidate getssome votesand the win-ningcandidate getsmore votesthan heneedsto win; these are all so-called “wast-ed votes”. Subtractone party’swastedvotesfrom the other’s, and then divide thatdiﬀerence bythe total numberofvotescast. Thisyieldsan “eﬃciencygap”. Ifit islarge enough (7% orhigher, theysay), onepartycan be said to hold a “systematicad-vantage” overthe other. In Wisconsin, theeﬃciencygap hasbeen ashigh as13%. Will Justice Kennedy, who lamented in2004 thatlegislatorswere “in the businessofriggingelections”, ﬁnd a wayto curbthem in Gill? In an earlypossible sign to thecontrary, he joined the fourconservativejusticeson June 19th in puttingthe lowercourt’srulingon hold pendingthe Su-preme Court’sultimate decision.

In 2016 the earned-income taxcredit(EITC), a wage subsidyforlow-income workers, paid out$67bn inrefundsto 27m taxpayers. WhereasEITCbeneﬁtscome outofthe Treasury’scoﬀers,eligibilityforthe taxbeneﬁt—which isbased on income and a numberofothervariables—isdetermined bytaxpayersthemselvesand cannoteasilybe veriﬁed.The IRSisnotallowed to correcterroneousEITCclaimsautomaticallyand itlacks theresourcesto auditmore than a small frac-tion ofhouseholdsthatreceive the beneﬁt.Asa result, the IRSestimatesthatin 2016nearlya quarterofall EITCpayments, to-talling$17bn, were issued improperly. Manyofthe incentivesthatdictate howthe governmentspendsfederal taxdollarstend notto preventfraud and waste but toencourage it. The private contractors em-ployed to paythe government’shealth-care billsare underpressure to processclaimsasquicklyand inexpensivelyaspossible. AsMalcolm SparrowofHar-vard’sKennedySchool ofGovernmentpointsout, “The cheapestwayto process aclaim isto payitwithoutquestion.” Law-makersare reluctantto boostspending onfraud investigation and enforcement—de-spite returnson investmentashigh as500%—forfearthatsuch measuresmightdelaylegitimate paymentsto providers orbeneﬁciaries. “Theywantto getbeneﬁtsoutthe door,” saysBeryl Davis, the GAO’sdirectorofﬁnancial management.Oﬃcialssaytheyare gettingcleverer atreducingwasteful spending, and are mov-ingawayfrom a “pay-and-chase” model, inwhich auditorsscramble to recovermoneyspenton fraudulentclaims, towardsonethatpreventssuch paymentsfrom beingmade in the ﬁrstplace (which iswhat cred-it-card issuersdo). In 2012 the CentresforMedicare and Medicaid Services(CMS),the agencythatadministersAmerica’stwopublichealth-care schemes, spent$40mon software thatscreensand veriﬁeshealth-care providers, usingthousands ofprivate and publicdatabases. The year be-fore the agencyshelled outanother$77mon a fraud-detection system thatscansreal-time claimsdata forsuspiciousbillingpatterns, and ﬂagsthose mostlikely to befraudulent.

Asthe teenage pregnancyrate has fall-en and the stigma attached to single moth-erhood hasfaded, the numberofbabiesplaced foradoption hasdeclined. In 1971,90,000 children were placed. By1975 thenumberhad fallen byhalf, mainlybecauseofthe legalisation ofabortion in 1973. In2014, only18,000 infantsunderthe age oftwo were placed foradoption.Meanwhile, adoptingfrom abroad hasalso become harder. Accordingto the StateDepartment, almost23,000 children wereadopted from abroad in 2004; lastyear,only5,400 were. Unicef, Save the Childrenand otherinternational charitiesconsidersuch adoptionsa lastresort; relatives andlocal adoptive parentsare preferred. RussiaChildren’s welfareFosterthe peopleCHICAGOAdoptions are declining, butmorechildren need fostercare32UnitedStatesThe EconomistJune24th20172hasclosed all international adoptions toAmerican citizensasa response to Westernsanctions, and corruption orchild-traﬃck-ingscandalshave ended adoptionsfromseveral countries, such asGuatemala. Thefederal governmenthasalso become morehostile. The result, saysElizabeth Bartholetofthe child-advocacyprogramme atHar-vard University, isthatthousandsof chil-dren lingerin grim institutions.The increased diﬃcultyofadoptingfrom abroad mighthave resulted in moreparentsadoptingchildren from the domes-ticfostersystem. Butfoster-care adoptionslevelled oﬀataround 50,000 annuallyafewyearsago. Atthe same time, aftersteadilydecliningbetween 2005 and 2012,the numberofchildren in need offostercare isincreasingin moststates. In 2015, themostrecentyearforwhich statistics areavailable, 428,000 children were in fostercare, compared with 397,000 in 2012. “The main reason forthe alarmingriseofchildren in fostercare isthe opioid epi-demic,” saysJohn DeGarmo, who with hiswife hasfostered over50 children. Misuseofdrugs, especiallypainkillers, and use ofheroin have become, between them, thesecond-most-common cause fora child’sremoval from parental care, afterneglect(often made worse bydruguse). The deep-lyreligiousDeGarmos, who have threechildren oftheirown, adopted three oftheirfosterchildren, all oﬀspringof drugaddicts. The goal offosteringisreuniﬁca-tion with birth parentsonce theyget better.Sadly, onlyabouta quarterofaddicts do.One reason forthe shortage offosterparentsisthe reluctance ofprospective par-entsto deal with the often needlessly bu-reaucraticpublicfosteragencies. Andaround 80% ofthose who tryto fosterachild give up within two years. “Fosteringisveryhard forall involved,” admitsMrDeGarmo. On average, fosterchildren stayforonly14 monthsatfosterparents’homes.

Debate on racial biasin policing tendsto be dominated bythe shootingsofunarmed blackmen bypolice oﬃcers.Though terrible, such shootingsare notcommon enough to allowthe crunchersofbigdata setsto getto work. Routinetraﬃcstops, on the otherhand, occurabout50,000 timesa dayacrossAmeri-ca.

The pool ofdriversthatthe police mightstop couldbe unrepresentative in all sortsof ways.Some ethnicgroupsmightdrive morethan others, orperhapsthere issomemysteriousracial diﬀerence in drivingstyle thatleadsto more police stops. Toanswerthe question properlythe lateGaryBecker, a Nobel-prizewinningecon-omist, devised a simple measure forracial biasin 1957. Beckerargued thattestsforracial discrimination should focus onthe outcome alone: in thiscase whetherpolice searchesofvehiclesyield contra-band, such asdrugsorillegal weapons. Ifblackmotoristswere stopped more often,even though theywere actuallylesslikelyto have somethingillegal in theglove compartment, thatwould providesolid proofofracial bias.The Stanford data showthatsearchesofwhite driversyield contraband 32% ofthe time. Bycontrast, when the driverwasblackorHispanic, the contraband hitrate was26%. Thatsuggestsa signiﬁcantamountofbias. Delve deeper, though,and the diﬀerence iscaused bya smallnumberofbad counties. Amongthe 496countiesforwhich the Stanford research-ershave complete data, just30 had a gapofmore than 25 percentage pointssep-aratingwhitesfrom minorities.

The Economistasked MrLewisifthe race wasworth the more than $50mspenton it, makingiteasilythe costliest incongressional history. “It’sworth every-thing,” MrLewissaid. “We’re talkingaboutthe future ofAmerica.” The momentcap-tured the oddityand excitementofthe con-test, and previewed what, forDemocrats,wasultimatelybitterdisappointment.To begin with, compare the two men.MrLewisisa revered civil-rightsleader.Composed and eerilydisciplined, MrOs-soﬀisa 30-year-old political novice: an un-likelychampion ofhisparty’shopes,though thatiswhathe became, in a votethatcame to be seen asa referendum onDonald Trump and the Republican agen-da. Judgingbythe volume oflaceratingtweetshe dispatched, MrTrump himselftookitpersonally, even ifhe misspelled thename ofKaren Handel, the eventual Re-publican winner. He, Mike Pence and PaulRyan wentto Georgia to stump forher.Next, considerthe districtitself. The bitsofCobb and two neighbouringcounties ofwhich itiscomprised are replete withsmarthousingdevelopmentsand pristinelawns. Itoughtto be safe Republican terri-tory—notleastbecause ithasbeen gerry-mandered to make itso. “These lineswerenotdrawn to getHankJohnson’sprotégé tobe myrepresentative,” one local Republi-can confessed, referringto a congressmanforwhom MrOssoﬀformerlyworked.And, until veryrecently, itwassafe: TomPrice, whose appointmentashealth secre-tarysetoﬀthe race, won itby23 percentagepointsin November. John McCain andMittRomneytookthe districteasily.MrTrump onlysqueaked it. Thatispartlybecause the area ischanging. Whitesare still a majorityin whatwere classicwhite-ﬂightplaces, buta smallerone:Cobb, once a reactionarybastion, willsoon be “majority-minority”. The sixth isnowthe best-educated Republican-heldseatin the country. Itis, in otherwords, thesortofrelativelycosmopolitan suburb theDemocratsoughtto conquer—in Califor-nia, Texas, Virginia and elsewhere—if theyare to regain control ofthe House in nextyear’smidterms. David Wasserman oftheCookPolitical ReportnotesthatHillaryClinton scored betterin only26 seatsheldbyRepublicans. The Democrats’ targetin2018 is24 seats. “Thisisrightatthe tippingpoint,” MrWasserman says. MrOssoﬀscouted outone possible,delicate path to thatgoal. Initially he ﬁredup the Democraticbase, and appealed toyoungvoters, byvowingto “Make TrumpFurious”. He recruited thousandsofvolun-teers, manyofwhom had neverbeen in-volved in politics. Duringthe campaign,one devotee wavinga “Vote yourOssoﬀ”placard said she previouslyfeared that ad-mittingleft-leaningviewsin Georgiawould mean “yourkidswill neverhave aplaydate”. But, especiallyafterhe fell justshortofa majorityin the ﬁrstround ofvot-ingin April, MrOssoﬀrecalibrated his toneto drawin the sliverofmoderate Republi-canshe needed, leavingthe Trump-bash-ingto outside groups. He oﬀered himself asacentrist, almostnon-partisan ﬁgure andhammerofwasteful spending.Great, againMsHandel and herbackingPACs, whichhelped herkeep pace with MrOssoﬀ’sfun-draising, were havingnone ofit. They re-lentlesslytied him to NancyPelosi, theHouse minorityleader, and her“San Fran-cisco values”. (One group lowered the tonefrom testyto combustible bylinkingMrOssoﬀto “unhinged leftists” who alleged-lycheered the recentshootingofa Repub-lican politician.) MsHandel faced a dilem-ma overherown orientation towardsMrTrump. Herapproach wasto supporthimifpressed, butnotto emphasise him. “Itisnotaboutwhat’sgoingon aroundthe restofthe country,” she declared atherelection-eve rally. Thatalso featured agee-up from Nathan Deal, who beather inGeorgia’sgovernor’selection in 2010; anelectoral veteran, MsHandel previouslylosta Senate race, too. (Herattacks on MrDeal, hisspokesman once sniﬀed, were“sadderthan the end of“Old Yeller”,” asappyﬁlm.) Aman in an Uncle Sam suitroared hisapproval forthe counter-slogan,“Keep yourOssoﬀmylawn”.MsHandel won the run-oﬀon June20th byfourpoints, confoundingpolls thatpredicted a closerresult. In retrospect theﬁrstround, in which 11Republicanssplittheirparty’svote, wasMrOssoﬀ’sbestchance. Despite the apposite demography,thatunusual format, plusthe manicatten-tion and spending—a bonanza forlocalbroadcasters—makesthe outcome onlyamuted bellwetherforthe mid-terms. Butthatwill notstop itbeingseen asone. Even though both candidatesimpliedthatMrTrump wasnoton the ballot, every-one else thoughthe was, and MsHandel’sstrategyoftacitloyaltywill be emulated inothertightraces. The president’sacolyteswere dulyjubilant. Given thathealth carewasprobablythe campaign’spre-eminentissue, with MsHandel supportingthe re-placementofObamacare, some congres-sional Republicansmaybe reassuredaboutthe consequencesofrepeal. In truth MrOssoﬀ’sperformance, likethose ofDemocratsin special elections inKansas, Montana and South Carolina, wasencouragingforhisparty, given the terrain.Butsome Democratshave seen in hisde-featfurtherevidence thatcentrism is de-functand a more radical brand ofopposi-tion necessary, even ifthatisunlikely tosucceed in the South. “The ﬁghtgoeson,”he vowed athiselection-nightparty, asMrLewisconsoled the crowd and elation gavewayto deﬂation, with an afterburn of de-ﬁance.

He isoddlyincuriousaboutforeign publics.AEuropean ambassadorrecentlytold Lexington an instruc-tive tale. On November9th, a dayafterMrTrump won the presi-dency, top oﬃcialsheld a crisismeetingin the envoy’scapital todiscusstheircountry’sdefence spending, which fallsshort ofthetargetagreed to byNATOmembers, which is2% ofGDP.

On theeve ofthe summitAmerican diplomatsbriefed the envoy’sgov-ernmentthatMrTrump would, aftermonthsofequivocation,formallycommithimselfto Article 5, the mutual-defence clausethatanchorsthe alliance. Butto the dismayofthe assembledleadersMrTrump leftthatline outofhisspeech, instead scoldingthem forowing“massive” sumsto NATO(he ﬁnallyendorsed Ar-ticle 5 in a pressconference on June 9th).Soon afterthatBrusselssummit, the same group ofgovern-mentmandarinsconvened in theirEuropean capital again, andthistime theirpolitical calculationshad changed.

Ourvotersdespise thisAmerican president.Asforthe biggestEuropean leaders, Angela Merkel distrusts himand Emmanuel Macron dislikeshim. So we’re oﬀthe hook.Americansmaybe forgiven forﬁndingthistale frustrating.ManyEuropean countriesare free-riderswhen itcomesto de-fence.

ButMrTrump believesthatforeign governmentshave abused thatgenerosity, aided andabetted bystupid, weakand fecklessAmerican leaders, so thatitistime to become more ruthlessand selﬁsh.The German Marshall Fund, a think-tank, thismonth gath-ered American, Chinese and European diplomats, oﬃcials, poli-ticiansand analystsforthe “Stockholm China Forum”, a bian-nual conference. Amongotherquestions, the forum consideredwhetherEurope orChina mightcome forward to lead the liberal,international world orderifAmerica tiresofthattask.Since MrTrump came to power, optimistshave suggested thathisboldestAmerica Firstmoves, such aswithdrawingfrom theParisclimate-change accords, orabandoningthe planned Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership, a trade pactwith 11Asia-Paciﬁcnations, mightpromptotherpowersto unite and promote global goodswithouthim.

Asked to help on cli-mate change, China reverted to argumentsaboutbeinga devel-opingcountrythatcan onlydo so much. Warm talkabout tradecannotconceal the barriersthatshield China’sdomesticmarkets.Ata summitin April with MrXi, MrTrump thoughthe had se-cured personal assurancesto putunprecedented pressure onNorth Korea to stop developingnuclearweaponsand missilesthatcould carrythem to American soil. Alas, MrXi appears tofearthe collapse ofNorth Korea on hisbordermore than he fearsdispleasingMrTrump—especiallygiven the need fordomesticstabilityahead ofa reshuﬄe ofChinese leaderslater thisyear.MrTrump seemsto have over-estimated hispersonal bondwith MrXi, telephoninghim so often to askaboutKorea co-oper-ation thatChinese oﬃcialsgrumbled to American contacts thattheirpresidentis“notourNorth Korean deskoﬃcer”. On June20th MrTrump tweeted somethingbetween an admission offail-ure and a warningthathe islosingpatience: “While I greatlyap-preciate the eﬀortsofPresidentXi & China to help with North Ko-rea, ithasnotworked out.

On abunting-trimmed stage atthe Manuel Ar-time theatre in Miami’sLittle Havananeighbourhood, the presidentofthe Un-ited Statesdeclared on June 16th thathewas“cancelling” the “completelyone-sid-ed deal with Cuba” made byhispredeces-sor, BarackObama. There ismuch less tothisthan Donald Trump’spugnaciousrhet-oricsuggests. Butthe newpolicywill stillhurtCuba’sﬂedglingprivate sector, dis-courage economicreform and damage Un-cle Sam’sprestige in Latin America. The deal struckin 2014 byMrObamaand Cuba’spresident, Raúl Castro, restoreddiplomaticrelationsafteran interruptionof54 years, softened the United States’trade embargo, eased travel between thecountriesand removed Cuba from the listofstate sponsorsofterrorism. Much of thatwill notchange. MrTrump’smain innova-tion isto make tourism harder, supposedlyto denyincome to Cuba’sarmed forces.Commercial ﬂightsand cruises, though,will continue. He thushopesto satisfy adiehard pro-embargo minoritywithoutrupturingrelations. UnderMrObama’srules, Americanseagerto sample mojitosin theircountry oforigin merelyhad to declare thattheywould engage in “people-to-people” ex-changesin orderto travel independently.UnderMrTrump’s, independenttravellerswill have to declare thattheyhave someothermission, like supportingcivil society,unlesstheyare ofCuban origin. People-to-ment. Visitsfrom the United Statesjumpedbya third in 2016 (see chart). Future visitorsface more complexityand confusion. Eveniftheyavoid army-owned hotels, theymightunknowinglyenrich the soldiers byrentinga car, takinga boattrip orevenswimmingwith dolphins. Militaryenter-prisesoﬀerall these services. Itis notclearwhetherAmericanswill be able to stay insuch popular(though overpriced) hotels asthe Hotel Nacional and the Parque Central.These are owned bythe tourism ministry,whose head isan army-reserve colonel. Tourorganiserswill no doubtsteertheirclientsawayfrom army-owned busi-nesses. Independenttravellerswill have todo theirown due diligence. MrTrump’sor-derwill dissuade some from goingin theﬁrstplace. Cuba’sentrepreneurial class, whichowesitsexistence to the country’scautiouseconomicreformsand much ofitsprosper-ityto the rise in tourism, isworried. MrTrump “isunderminingthe veryprivatesectorhe claimsto support”, lamentstheownerofa paladar(a family-owned res-taurant) in the Vedado districtofHavana.On paper, the changesannounced byMrTrump are “subtle, butin practice they willhave huge consequences”, predictsan en-trepreneurwho runsa small consultancy. Although Americansare just7% offor-eign touristsin Cuba, theyare generous tip-persand patronise private businesses. Cu-banswho letouttheirhomesthroughAirbnb have collected nearly$40m in rev-enue since April 2015. On average theyget$2,700 a year, nearlyten timesthe typicalsalary. Tourorganisershave tended tobooktheirclientsinto hotels. Ironically, Cuba’sgovernmenthasjoined MrTrump in crackingdown on thecountry’semergentcapitalism. Shortly be-fore hisannouncement, with talkoftougherAmerican policyin the air, the gov-ernmentrestricted the openingofnew res-people visitorswill have to join organisedtours. He also intendsto ban transactionsbyindividualsand ﬁrmswith companieslinked to Cuba’sarmyand intelligence ser-vices. Thiscould have biggerconse-quences. GAESA, a conglomerate run bythe armed forces, isthoughtto control upto 60% ofthe economy. Itsholdingsincludepetrol stations, supermarketsand ports.One ofitscompanies, Gaviota, owns29,000 hotel rooms, some ofwhich aremanaged byforeign chainslike Kempinski,Meliá and Starwood, an American ﬁrm. Whatall thiswill mean in practice willdepend on rulesissued bythe USTreasuryand Commerce departments.

Arecentsessionofthe legislature reaﬃrmed the state’scon-trol overthe economyand itsopposition toconcentration ofprivate property. Thisisnotsurprising. Halfa century ofAmerican sanctionsdid notpromote liber-ty. In fact, theygave Cuba’sgovernmentanexcuse notto open the economyorholdfree elections. Although MrTrump por-trayshistoughnessasa wayto spurde-mocracy, itmaydo the opposite.

Thatwill end nearly60 yearsofrule bythe Castro family (MrCastro’sbrother, Fidel, led the country’srevolution in 1959 and governed until2006). Itmighthave been an opportunityto liberalise, but, saysMrNieves, Mr Trumphasgiven conservatives“a perfectinstru-mentto manage the speed ofchange”.AfterMrTrump turned up the heat,Cuba keptitscool. The governmentcriti-cised his“hostile rhetoric” butsaid itwillcontinue “respectful dialogue and co-oper-ation”. Ajointﬁghtagainstdrug-traﬃcking,forexample, maycontinue.

Behind these showsofforce isa desper-ate race between an emboldened Syrianregime (and itsRussian and Iranian allies)and American-backed forcesto grab therump ofterritorycontrolled bya falteringISalongSyria’sborderwith Iraq. Itis a racethatAmerica and itsalliesmaylose. On June 9th the Syrian armyand Irani-an-backed militiamen reached the borderwith Iraq forthe ﬁrsttime since 2015.

But, aswith the downingofthe Syri-an airforce jet, America saysitcarried outthe strikesin self-defence and thatthey donotsignal a broaderstrategyto confrontIran, the Syrian regime orRussia. Yetthere isalso little Washington cando to push backIran orthe regime withoutinﬂamingthe conﬂictand hinderingtheﬁghtagainstIS. Iran’spresence in Syria isformidable.

The gameswould simplyprovide an opportunityforcorruption, Momentum argued. The grouphassince turned itselfinto a political party,ahead ofelectionsin early2018. Mostofitsleaderswere born ascommunism col-lapsed. Manyhave studied abroad. Theylookto Emmanuel Macron, France’syoungpresident, forinspiration (although Mr Fe-kete-Gyorisquickto pointoutthathe isyounger).

The then prime min-ister, FerencGyurcsany, once hailed as amoderniserin the mould ofTonyBlair,wasrecorded deliveringan expletive-lad-en secretspeech. To win election, he toldpartymembers, the partyhad “lied morn-ing, noon and night” aboutthe country’sﬁ-nances. The speech leaked, promptingmassprotests. Like MrBlair, MrGyurcsanyischarismaticand divisive. Unlike MrBlair, he remainsimportantin domesticpolitics: the Socialistssplit, and Mr Gyurc-sanyformed a newparty, the DemocraticCoalition.

Instead, theytalk abouttheircommitmentto the EUand the pro-blem oflowwages. Marton Gyongyosi, a well-dressed Job-bikMPand formertaxadviser, saysthatthe partyhasgrown up. In 2012 MrGyon-gyosi called on the governmentto draw uplistsofHungarian Jewswho pose a nation-al-securitythreat. Todayhe acknowledges kete-Gyorsays. “We are open.”ButHungaryisnotFrance. Since 2010,when he secured a crushingsupermajor-ityin parliament, ViktorOrban, Hungary’sprime minister, haslaunched a systematicassaulton the country’schecksand bal-ances.

Even on itsown,LRMwon 308 seats, a clearmajority. That isaremarkable outcome fora political outﬁtlaunched onlylastyear.

Yethe had little chance to savour themomentorprepare forthe legislative ses-sion thatbeginson June 27th. Hisgovern-mentfaced daysofawkward scrutinyasfourministersquit. On June 19th RichardFerrand, an LRM ministerclose to MrMac-ron who hasbeen caughtup in a ﬁnancialscandal, stepped down. (He will becomethe party’sleaderin parliament.) Over thefollowingdaysthree ministersfrom Mo-Dem, a centristally, also resigned. Investi-gatorsare lookinginto whethertheymis-used European parliamentaryfunds.The lossofSylvie Goulard asdefenceministerisa blow. She had proved capablein herbriefstint. In contrast, the exit ofthesometimeshot-headed FrançoisBayrou(pictured left), the justice minister andleaderofMoDem, mightprove a relief. Thismonth he harangued a radio journalist,provokingthe prime minister, EdouardPhilippe, to tell him to be more ministerial.MrBayrou, who wasleadingthe govern-ment’spush to clean up politicsbysettingstricterruleson the use ofpublicmoney,wasunderpressure to prove himselfabovesuspicion. He remainsa political force: his42 deputieswill supportMrMacron, whoowesMrBayrouforhisearlyendorsementin the presidential campaign.Still, the resignationshave raiseddoubtsaboutthe newadministration’scompetence. Itlooked clumsy, forexample,when MrPhilippe implied thatMrBayrouwould stayin oﬃce, justhoursbefore newsbroke thathe wasgoing. On June 21stMrMacron reshuﬄed hiscabinet, taking careto preserve the balance between left- andright-leaningministers. Thatisessential forapresidentwhose popularityisnotpartic-ularlyhigh and could slide ifhe veers in ei-therdirection, saysLaurentBouvet, a polit-ical scientistatVersaillesUniversity.The centre-rightRepublicansand theirallieswill form the main opposition, with136 deputies, farfewerthan theyhad ex-pected earlyin the campaign.

Thatleavesthe Re-publican rump more isolated. Itsonly con-solation isthatthe formerincumbent, theSocialistParty, iseven more downcast. TheSocialistsand theirallieshave only 45 dep-uties, theirworstresultin modern history.Theirdepartingleader, Jean-ChristopheCambadélis, who losthisown seat, saysthe “collapse ofthe SocialistPartyis be-yond doubt”.The noisiestopposition to MrMacron’sadministration maycome from the ex-tremes. Marine Le Pen, whose hard-rightNational Fronthaseightdeputies, won herrace in a formercoal-miningregion innorthern France. Jean-LucMélenchon,whose far-leftUnsubmissive France partywon 17 seats, waselected in Marseille.

In the early1980sRonald Reagan’sattemptsto thwarta So-vietpipeline thatwould bringSiberian gasto Europe irritated theWestGermansand drove the French to proclaim the end of thetransatlanticalliance. The castofcharactershasshifted a little to-day, butmanyofthe argumentsare the same. In Nord Stream 2(NS2), a proposed Russian gaspipeline, Germanyseesa respect-able projectthatwill cutenergycostsand lockin secure supplies.American politicians(and the ex-communistcountriesof easternEurope) detecta Kremlin plotto deepen Europe’saddiction tocheap Russian gas. TheydecryGerman spinelessness.NS2, which itsbackershope will come online atthe end of2019, would supplygasdirectlyfrom Russia’sBalticcoastto theGerman portofGreifswald, doublingthe capacityofNordStream 1, an existingline. Itsdefenders, includinga consortium ofﬁve European ﬁrmsthatwill coverhalfitscostof€9.5bn($10.6bn), saythatitwill help pluga projected gap between Eu-rope’sstable demand forgasand decliningproduction in theNetherlandsand North Sea. Germany’sgovernment, especiallythe Social DemocraticParty(SPD), the juniorcoalition partner,sharesthisview. (Gerhard Schröder, a formerSPDchancellorofGermany, chairsNS2’sboard.) Some Germansquietlyhope thatNS2 could transform theircountryinto a European energyhub.Such argumentsstrike sceptics—countrieslike Poland and theBalticstates, energyexpertsatthe European Commission, for-eign-policyhawksand a handful ofGerman renegades—asmyo-pic. NS2, theysay, mightlowerfeesforGermansbutraises themforeastern Europeansfurtherdown the chain. Itundermines theEuropean Union’sstated aim to diversifyitssourcesofenergy(Russia accountsfor34% ofthe EU’soverall gasmarket, butfarmore in some countries). ItallowsGazprom, the Kremlin-backedenergygiant, to bypassexistingpipelinesin Ukraine, deprivingthe Ukrainiansoflucrative transitfees. Bysqueezingexisting sup-plyroutes, NS2 mightalso leave Ukraine obliged to negotiate cap-in-hand with itsarch-enemy(Kievhasnotimported gasdirectlyfrom Gazprom since 2015). Gazprom hasproved willingto wageenergywarsbefore. Whycontribute to itsarsenal?To thisﬁerybrewhasnowbeen added America’stoxicRussiapolitics. Earlierthismonth the Senate passed a bipartisan bill thatwould, amongotherthings, allowthe Treasuryto slap sanctionson foreign companiesthatinvestin Russian pipelines. (The bill isnotyetlaw: itawaitsdebate in the House ofRepresentatives, andDonald Trump hasyetto opine on itsmerits.) The move spookedEurope’sﬁrmsand enraged some ofitspoliticians. “Europe’sen-ergysupplyisEurope’sbusiness, notthatofthe United States ofAmerica,” thundered Germany’sforeign minister, SigmarGabri-el, and Austria’schancellor, Christian Kern, in a jointstatement.The pairwere particularlyincensed thatthe bill included a call toincrease American exportsofliqueﬁed natural gas, implying thatblockingRussian gaswaspartlyan eﬀortto help American ener-gycompanies.Angela Merkel, Germany’schancellor, letitbeknown thatshe supported herminister.The timingofthe Senate bill isawful. On June 26th the EU’s28governmentswill begin debatingwhetherto allowthe EuropeanCommission to negotiate the termsofNS2 directlywith Russia.MrsMerkel arguesthatEUinstitutionshave no businessintrud-ingin a purelycommercial enterprise. Butcountrieslike Swedenand Denmark, which mustgrantenvironmental permitsiftheprojectisto proceed, wantthe commission to getinvolved so thattheyare notleftalone to stare down the Kremlin. Foes ofNS2, likePoland, thinkbringingin the commission mightbe a way to slowthe projectdown. The discussion will be a fascinatingtest ofGer-many’sabilityto swayopinion inside the European club. Don’tlookbackto AngieForobserverswho see MrsMerkel asVladimirPutin’smain Euro-pean adversary, herstance isperhapsthe biggestpuzzle. Thechancellorhelpsbrokernegotiationsbetween Russia and Uk-raine. Againstdomesticand foreign opposition, she has held theline on the EU’ssanctionsagainstRussia overitsland grabs. Herstrategylooked like a textbookcase ofEuropean leadership, plac-ingGerman intereststo one side forthe greatercause of EUunityand resistance to outside aggressors. Butthe chancellor’stacityetclearsupportforNS2 suggeststhata correction maybe in order. Hercommitmentto Ukraine isnotin doubt, and she isinfuriated byMrPutin’slies. ButGer-manyhasneveraccepted the mantle ofEuropean orglobal lead-ership thatso manywould like to thrustupon it, especially whenitcomesto the politicsofenergy. Outsidersshould not be sur-prised to see itbehave like anyotherEuropean country favouringitsown consumersand ﬁrms(two ofthe ﬁve companiesinvest-ingin NS2 are German). American intervention mayonlystrengthen Germany’sresolve to protectitscommercial interests.Those hopingto slowNS2 would do betterto lookto Brussels.The commission will be happyto smotherthe pipeline in bu-reaucracy, should the EU’sgovernmentsgive ita chance. Its legalbrainssaythatEU energylawdoesnotapplyto oﬀshore pipe-linesoutside the internal market. Butthe commission dislikesNS2 and distrustsGazprom, which itthinksabusesmarket domi-nance. “IfGazprom wasStatoil [Norway’snational energyﬁrm],we wouldn’thave a problem,” saysone oﬃcial. So NS2 mayyetbe asked to obeypartsofEU law, includingthird-partyaccessto the pipeline and transparencyon pricing.Ukrainian anxietiesmightbe allayed byinsistingthatGazpromcommitto maintainingsupplythrough existingpipelines after2019, when the currentcontractexpires. Thismightease fears thatNS2 will leave partsofEurope in hockto the Russiansfor decadesto come. Butbefore then a thousand thingscan go wrong. 7Putthatin yourpipeAproposed Russian-German gas deal smells funnyto AmericaCharlemagneThe EconomistJune24th201747For daily analysis and debate on Britain, visitEconomist.com/britain1FLYoverthe capital and manytowerblocksthrustup from ground below.One standsoutfrom the rest.

Yetifhe iscastfrom the same mould asMrsMay, he is a supe-riorversion. He iscleverer. In interviewshe answersquestions,ratherthan trottingouttrite formulae, and presentsadmirablynuanced arguments. He can be amusingin private, which is sel-dom said ofMrsMay.

Older, much-alteredbuildingsare atparticularrisk. Itistoo earlyto be sure whatcaused thefailure atGrenfell.

Some,like a pairin Dubai in 2015, and anotherinMelbourne in 2014, were casualty-free. Butone in Shanghai in 2010 killed 58 people. Accordingto Edwin Galea, who runsthe Fire SafetyEngineeringGroup attheUniversityofGreenwich, Britain’sﬁre-safetyruleshave, atleastin the past, reliedunusuallyheavilyon compartmentation.Sprinklersystemsare anothercommonmethod ofﬁre suppression.

Regula-tionsin mostpartsofBritain are laxer. Faith in compartmentation iswhymanyofGrenfell’sresidentswere advisedto stayin theirhomesforsome time afterthe ﬁre started. Thisstrategy, called “de-fend in place”, relieson the compartmentsholding, in which case stayingputmaywell be saferthan ﬂeeingthrough smokeand heat. Italso helpskeep emergencystairsclear, meaningﬁreﬁghterscan reach acontained blaze more quickly. Forthis rea-son, saysDrGalea, manyolderBritish tow-erblockswere notconstructed with build-ing-wide ﬁre alarms, orintercom systemsthatenable ﬁreﬁghtersto broadcast in-structionsto residents. In mostothercountries, such systemsare common. Otherplacesalso putgreaterweighton the second aspectofﬁre-safetyengineering: escape, usuallybyinsistingthattall buildingshave atleasttwo stair-cases, placed farapart. (Grenfell, like manyBritish towerblocks, had onlyone). Thatlogicisobvious. But, aswith compartmen-tation, the strategycan occasionally fail,with horriﬁcresults. Staircasesare de-signed to be ﬁreproofcompartmentsintheirown right, and to keep smoke out. Butresearch published in 2013 byacademicsatthe UniversityofEdinburgh analysingdata from 50 buildingﬁresaround theworld found thatsigniﬁcantamountsofsmoke veryoften made itinto stairwellswhile people were still escapingbythem.In 1980 a ﬁre atthe MGMGrand hotel in LasVegaskilled 85 people. Mostdied in thesmoke-ﬁlled stairwell. Evacuatinglarge numbersofpeoplefrom a tall buildingisunavoidablydiﬃ-cult. And the problem isgettingworse, forthe world isnotonlybuildingmore ofthem—itisbuildingthem higher, aswell(see chart). Asﬂoorsare added, ittakes lon-gerto evacuate everyone bythe stairs. Inthe tallestbuildings, itcan take an hourormore, comparable to the amountoftimethe buildingcan resistthe spread of ﬁre. Afurthercomplication isthatthe popula-tionsofmanyrich countriesare becomingolder, fatterand lessﬁt. Disabled people of-ten cannotuse stairsatall.So engineersare studyingotherways toevacuate buildings. One idea isto abandondecadesofsafetydogma and encourageresidentsoftall towersto evacuate by thelifts. Studiessuggestthatcould speedthingsup byasmuch astwo-thirds.

Psychologyisasimportantastechnol-ogy. StudiesDrNilsson hasconducted us-ingvirtual realitysuggestthat, even whentheyknowtheyare in no real danger, peo-ple are willingto waitonlya fewminutesfora ﬁre-escape liftto arrive. One advan-tage ofsuch liftsisthattheycan be pro-grammed to give priorityto the ﬂoors near-estthe ﬁre. Butthatcan leave people onotherﬂoorsfeelingstranded. Displayinginformation such asan estimated time tothe lift’sarrival can help quell panic. Refuge ﬂoorsare anotheridea. Theseare essentiallysuper-compartments—un-inhabited ﬂoorsdesigned to resistthespread ofﬁre formuch longerthan normal.Theyare often open to the outside so thatsmoke cannotbuild up. Disabled orin-jured occupants, orthose farthestfrom theﬁre, whose evacuation islessurgent, canshelteron them until congestion on thestairseasesorhelp comes. Manycountries,includingHongKong, India, Singapore andSouth Korea, alreadyspecifytheirinclu-sion in buildingsovera certain height. “Skybridges” linkingtwo ormore talltowersare anotheroption. These enableevacueesfrom above the bridge to crossinto a safe building. The skybridge linkingthe twin PetronasTowersin Kuala Lumpurformspartoftheirﬁre-escape plan. Suchbridgescan be retro-ﬁtted to existing build-ings, saysDrNilsson; the Gothia Towers inGothenburgare an example. Otherplacesare consideringmore exoticideas. India in-siststhatthe tallesttowershave helipadson theirroofs, though DrNilsson isuncon-vinced. “Helicoptersare small and slow,”he says. “And itcan be verydiﬃcultto landthem in the face ofall the hotairrising fromaburningbuilding.”Givingengineersmore optionsisvalu-able, saysDrGalea. Butnone can solve allproblems. Sprinklershelp, butthe 2014Melbourne ﬁre started on a balconyandonlyspread inside once itwasestablished,bywhich time the sprinklerscould notstop it. Defend in place isusuallya goodstrategy, butwhen itfails, the conse-quencescan be deadly. More escape routesare good, provided theydo notputpan-icked occupantsin extra danger. The bestapproach, he says, is“defence in depth”: in-cludingseveral safetyfeatures, each com-pensatingforanother’svulnerabilities. Buteven the bestﬁre-safetymethodsand regulationswill be uselessif, becauseofcorner-cuttingorlackofvigilance, theyare nottranslated into reality.

The ride-hailing giantfound a way. MrKalanickfailed to managethe falloutfrom a seriesofhigh-proﬁleblundersand scandals. On June 20th he re-signed aschiefexecutive oﬃcerofthe ﬁrmhe co-founded in 2009. Uberisfacingseveral crises, includingseniorexecutive departures, a lawsuit overalleged intellectual-propertytheft, claimsaboutsexual harassmentand a federalprobe into itsuse ofpotentiallyillegal soft-ware to trackregulators. MrKalanick hadpreviouslysaid he would take a leave ofabsence, in partto deal with a personaltragedy—the death ofhismotherin a boat-ingaccident. Thatwasnotenough for in-vestorsin Uber, who asked him to makehisleave permanent.Uberwill notchange overnight. Mr Ka-lanicktrained itto be unrelentingly com-petitive, aggressive and readyto breakrules. Thatculture helped make itthe mostprominentprivate American technologyﬁrm, with a valuation ofnearly$70bn. Butthe impactofMrKalanick’sself-styled “al-waysbe hustlin’ ” approach hasbeen stark.Uber’scontroversieshave dented itsbrand, hurtitsabilityto recruitthe besten-gineersand costitcustomersin America,who are defectingto itsrival, Lyft.The identityofMrKalanick’sreplace-mentwill be crucial. Uber’sboard willseekan experienced boss, perhapsa wom-an. He orshe will need experience runningamultinational. Whetherthe boardshould hire someone with a backgroundin transport(perhapsfrom an airline orlo-gisticsﬁrm) ora candidate from the tech-nologyindustryisunclear. Some have sug-gested thatSheryl Sandberg, who serves asnumbertwo atFacebook, would be a goodchoice, butshe maynotbe willingto jump.Investorsin Uberhave accepted that MrKalanickwill stayon the company’sboard(alongwith hisco-founderand anotherearlyexecutive, he controlsthe majority ofsuper-votingshares) so he islikelyto haveastronginﬂuence on the ﬁrm. He will needto exercise restraint. Twitter, an internetcompanythatisstrugglingto attract moreusers, found ithard to settle on a clear strat-egyin partbecause several co-founderswho once ran itcontinued to serve on theboard and second-guessed the boss.MrKalanick’sdeparture should beenough to placate some alienated custom-ers. RegulatorsmaytreatUbermore kindly,too. Abroad, itsscandalshave barely regis-tered. In the ﬁrstquarterofthisyear itnotched up record revenues, of$3.4bn. Itslosses, ofaround $700m, are still high butdiminishing. The nextchiefexecutive willneed to decide whetherto chase growthand endure continued steep losses, or cutbackon international expansion in orderto make more money. AfterwatchingMrKalanickpush the pedal to the metal,Uber’sinvestorsmayhope thata moreconservative era—in termsofﬁnances aswell asculture—isaboutto begin. 7UberGearchangeAnewera begins atUberas TravisKalanicksteps down ScootINAcornerofthe state ofUttarPradesh(UP) standsa gleamingbuildingdedicat-ed to animal slaughteron an industrialscale.

MrRobbins’staskisto keep itrele-vantasmore and more computingmovesinto the cloud, which entailsthe provisionofall kindsofservicesoverthe internet.On June 20th the ﬁrm announced a collec-tion ofnewproductswhich showhowit isadapting: Cisco will focuson software andservices, particularlythe sortthatauto-mate the managementofdata networks.Cisco isbestknown foritsswitches androuters(the formerare the central buildingblocksofnetworks, the latterconnectthem with each other). Although item-braced the internet’sopen standards, Ciscocame to dominate data networkingforte-lecomsﬁrmsand otherenterprises. Its box-esworkwell with each otherand they canbe centrallymanaged. Mostﬁrms’ networkengineersknowhowto use Cisco’sboxes.Although itsmarketshare hasdeclined inrecentyears, the ﬁrm still sellsmore thanhalfofall newswitchesand routers, whichtogethergenerate more than halfofits an-nual revenue ofabout$50bn.Owningthe mightiestplatform in net-working, saysPierre FerraguofSanford C.Bernstein, a research ﬁrm, providesa de-fence againstcompetitors, such asChina’sHuawei and Arista Networks, based inCalifornia. Italso makesCisco lessvulner-able to a problem bedevillingsome mak-ersofcomputingand storage gear, such asDell, EMCorHPE: “commoditisation”,meaningtheyare losingpricingpower.ButCisco’sfranchise isfacingtwothreats. First, the more computingis donein the cloud, the lessﬁrmshave to buy theirown gear, includingnetworkingequip-ment. Instead ofpayingforan “end-to-endnetwork” from Cisco, bigcloud operatorssuch asAmazon and Microsoftprefergearthatpreciselyﬁtstheirrequirements. ThisiswhyCisco’scloud saleshave disappoint-ed, while more specialised vendorssuchasArista have made inroads. The secondthreatisthatsoftware isincreasingly im-portantto hownetworksare run: thatmakesiteasierforrivalsto sidestep orover-take Cisco’sproducts.UnderMrRobbins, Cisco hasrespond-ed in several ways.

For theﬁrsttime, Cisco will sell newswitchesthatcome with subscriptionswhich unlockthese sortsofextra capabilities. Develop-erswill getmore toolsto write applicationsforCisco’splatform.

Ithasenough moneyto pursue itsambitions: more than $70bn in cash. Butcomputingcould yetbecome muchmore centralised, leavinglessspace for Cis-co to knitthingstogether. Bigcloud provid-erswill also tryto getinto the business ofmanagingand automatingnetworks. AndCisco hasa mixed record ofimplementingitsstrategy. Howeverwell itdoes, Cisco isunlikelyto achieve a goal setbyMrCham-bersbackin 2013: to become the world’s“number-one player” in corporate-infor-mation technology.

Butone kind ofChi-nese good fewabroad dare touch: itsﬁnan-cial assets. Outsidersown lessthan 2% ofitssharesand bonds, farbelowthe levelsofforeign ownership seen in othermar-kets. Capital barriersand ﬁnancial riskshave putinvestorsoﬀ. This, however, ischanging. The globalisation ofChina’scap-ital marketsisslowlygatheringsteam, assymbolised bythe inclusion ofChinesestocksand bondsin global indices.MSCI, a companythatdesignsstock-marketindices, announced on June 20ththatitwill bringChinese equitiesinto twoofitsbenchmarks: one thatcoversemerg-ingmarkets; and anotherthatfollowsstocksaround the world. To begin, it willinclude a small numberofshares, just 222ofthe more than 3,000 listed in China. Butitsdecision mattersto assetmanagers whotracktheirperformance againstMSCI’sin-dicesorwho investin exchange-tradedfundslinked to them. Theywill in eﬀect beforced to allocate capital to China’sstock-markets, manyforthe ﬁrsttime. BecauseMSCIisgivingChinese stocksa limitedweighting(0.73% ofitsemerging-marketsindex), the resultingcash inﬂowscouldadd up to onlyabout$10bn nextyear,equivalentto lessthan one houroftradingin China’sfreneticmarkets. Yetthe weight-ersbuymainland stocksin HongKong.Foreign institutionsalreadyhold Chi-nese sharesbutuntil nowhave mainly fo-cused on ﬁrmslisted in HongKong(seeboxon nextpage) and America. TheseoverseasChinese stocksform 28% oftheMSCIemerging-marketsindex. Buton-shore Chinese stocksare collectively muchmore valuable. Theyalso encompassa farwiderrange ofcompanies. The pensionsand universityendowmentsthatfollowMSCIwill nowown sharesin makersoftraditional Chinese medicine and distillersofbaijiu, a ﬁerygrain liquor—albeit onlyintinyamountsinvested passivelythroughindextrackers. Chinese fund managershope thattheMSCIseal ofapproval mightalso entice ac-tive investors. “Ifyoulike Chinese food,youshould go to China and have the realfood. Itisso much more diverse and au-thentic,” saysWangQi, chiefexecutive ofMegaTrustInvestment, a Shanghai-basedfund manager. Butmanyforeignersstillshun the local fare. The stockmarketre-mainsrife with insidertradingand pricemanipulation. Memoriesofa debacle in2015, when authoritiesintervened heavilyaftera bubble burst, also remain fresh. Chi-nese regulatorsare bettingthatgreater par-ticipation byinternational institutions willhelp bringorder. China’sbond marketcould prove justassigniﬁcantin integratingitsﬁnancial sys-tem with the restofthe world. In May thecentral bankannounced thatforeign inves-torswould be able to buyonshore bondsvia the HongKongbond market. Thispro-gramme, which isexpected to startin July,will pave the wayforbond indicesto in-clude Chinese debt.

Alibaba, a Chinese e-com-merce giant, lefta deep scarwhen itchose the NewYorkStockExchange foritsblockbusterlistingin 2014. ItjiltedHongKongbecause ofitsban on dual-classshares, which grantsome share-holdersoutsize votingrights. Soon after,HKEXtried to persuade HongKong’sSecuritiesand FuturesCommission (SFC)to allowsuch companiesto listin HongKong. Butcorporate-governance activistsand bigfund managerssuch asBlackRocklined up againstit; so did the SFC. Propo-nentssayentrepreneurscan make gooduse ofdual structures(thinkGoogle).Opponentsargue thatothershareholderslose outasa result.Since Alibaba, a slewofChinese techﬁrmshave slipped through HongKong’sgrasp.

The SFCappearsto be softeningitsstance on dual-classstructures; bankerssalivate overnewmoneymakingopportunities. YetHKEXmaynotgetapproval. Go-vernance hawksstill oppose dual-classshares. “We thinkit’swrongto developthe marketbyloweringstandards,” saysJamie Allen ofthe Asian Corporate Go-vernance Association (ACGA), an in-dependentadvocacygroup. Singapore’sconsultation, he notes, hasalsoprompted strongadverse reactions.Proposed safeguards, such asstricterdisclosure rules, do notconvince sceptics.And the factthatthe newboard’smaintargetswould be companiesfrom China,where businesscan have a whiﬀoftheWild West, compoundsthe riskto itsreputation.Some also question the com-mercial beneﬁtsforHKEX: Graeme Lane,abroker, pointsoutthatlastyear dailyturnoveron itsboardsfell by37%, despitethe addition ofover100 companies.

Atthisyear’sParisshow, the world’slargest, which opened atLe Bourgetairporton June 19th, the mili-tarytypesare mostostentatious. Aeronau-tical partytricksinclude helicopters thatascend into the skytail-ﬁrstand stealthﬁghtersthatﬂybackwards.Butno one iskeenerto struttheir stuﬀthan Airbusand Boeing, the world’stwobiggestmakersofairliners. Atthe 2015showthe pairsold 752 planeswortharound $107bn. Butthe partyatmosphereatthatevent—with copiousfood and winelaid on forcustomersand journalistsalike—hasgiven waythisyearto a more so-bermood, weakersalesand a bring-your-own-lunch policy. Thisshould give pauseto investorsin one ofthe world’sfastest-growingassetclasses: aircraft.Airbusand Boeingstill booked plentyoforders. Butforthe ﬁrsttime, most camefrom lessors, which lease them to opera-tors, ratherthan from the airlinesthat usethem. Thishasfuelled fearsthatthe surgein investmentgoinginto aircraftﬁnance ispushingordersfornewjets, and prices forold ones, to unsustainable levels. “We’re inabubble thatwill burst,” saysAdam Pilar-ski ofAvitas, a consultancy. “Itisonlyaquestion oftimingand severity.”In the pastairlinesboughtplanes withexpensive unsecured bankloansorstatehandouts. Butsince the 1970s, the owner-ship ofaircrafthasgraduallybeen hivedoﬀto ﬁnancial ﬁrms. Thishasbeneﬁts forboth airlinesand investors, explains AlecBurger, chiefexecutiveofGECAS, theworld’sbiggestlessor. Leasingrather thanbuyinggivescarriersthe ﬂexibility to ex-pand orshrinkﬂeetsquickly. Itcan cuttaxbills. And aslessorsare often bigger thanairlines, theycan strike betterdeals withplanemakersand borrowmore cheaply.Investorsalso ﬁnd aircraftattractive as-sets. International agreementsmake iteasyto repossessone when an airline de-faultson a payment.

Asthe rate ofreturn onotherinvestmentsisso low, aircraft havebecome even more attractive investments,explainsMichel Dembinski ofMUFG, abank, particularlyforshort-term “hot”money. Manydoubtthisisbeinginvestedwisely. Newleasingoutﬁtswith no experi-ence ofpreparingfora downturn are ex-pandingparticularlyrecklessly. The num-berofChinese lessorsalone hasgrownfrom almostnone to over50 in a decade.MrPilarski detectssignsthatthe bubblemaybe aboutto burst. Air-passengernum-bersare risingfasterthan the long-term av-erage, butthere isalreadysevere overca-pacityin Europe, the Middle Eastand Asia,and too manynewplanesare comingonstream. Manylessorsstruggle to ﬁnd newoperatorsforaircraftreturned to themwhen leasesexpire. Interest-rate rises mayalso threaten assetprices. “Lessorsmade alotofmoneyon the wayup,” saysSaj Ah-mad, an aviation expert. “Theywill alsolose a lotifthingscome down.”Afull-blown crash in airlinervalues—like the one since 2013 forshipswhich leftbanksnursing$400bn in bad loans—isfarfrom certain.

Even so, aircraftinvestorsshouldprepare fora bumpyride.7THE biginvestmentshiftofrecent yearsisfrom active to passive. Clients havebeen buyingindexfunds, which passive-lytracka benchmarklike the S&P 500 in-dex, and shunningfund managerswhoactivelytryto pickthe bestshares. One reason forthe shiftisthatpassivemanagerscharge lowerfeesthan activefunds. Manyclientswould be happytopaymore ifthattranslated into better per-formance. However, itisverydiﬃcult forinvestorsto selectfund managerswhocan reliablybeattheirpeers. Performancedoesnotpersist, asthe latestdata fromS&PDowJonesIndicesshowclearly.Suppose youhad picked one ofthebest-performing25% ofAmerican equitymutual fundsin the 12 monthsto March2013. In the subsequent12 months, toMarch 2014, only25.6% ofthose fundsstayed in the top quartile (see chart). Thatresultisno betterthan chance. In the sub-sequent12-month periods, thiselitebunch iswinnowed down to 4.1%, 0.5%and 0.3%—all ﬁguresthatare worse thanchance would predict. Similarresults ap-plyifyouhad picked one ofthe best-per-forming50% ofall funds; those in the up-perhalfofthe chartsfailed to stay there.Perhapsthisisan unfaircomparison;fund managerscannotbe expected to out-perform everyyear. Butclientsdo hopetheycan deliversuperiorreturnsover thelongrun. So S&PDowJonesIndicesranthe numbersin a diﬀerentway. Supposeyouhad picked a fund with a top-quartileperformance in the ﬁve yearsto March2012. Whatproportion ofthose fundswould be in the top quartile overthe sub-sequentﬁve years(to March 2017)?The answerisjust22.4%: again, lessthan chance would suggest. Indeed, 27.6%ofthe starfundsin the ﬁve years to March2012 were in the worst-performingquar-tile in the ﬁve yearsto March 2017. Inves-torshad a higherchance ofpickinga dudthan a winner. The industry’sanswerto thisproblemisto launch a lotoffunds. Some ofthemare bound to be nearthe top ofthe chartsand can be trumpeted in adverts; the loserscan then be killed oﬀ. Almost30% oftheworst-performing(bottom quartile) equityfundsoverthe ﬁve yearsto March 2012 hadbeen merged orliquidated byMarch 2017. Itshould notbe a surprise thatthe aver-age fund failsto beatthe index. The “ironlawofcosts” isthat, in aggregate, profes-sional fund managersown mostofthestockmarket. Thustheirperformance ishighlylikelyto resemble thatofan indexthattracksthe overall market. Butthe indexdoesnotincurcostsorfees; fund managersdo. Thusthe average fund managermustunderperform the market, aftercosts.Whydoesn’tfund managementcon-form to the rulesofprofessional sports,where athletessuch asCristiano RonaldoorRogerFedererconsistentlyoutperformtheirrivals? One reason could be that suc-cessful managersattractmore clients, andthe size oftheirfund grows. So they have toexpand the numberofstockstheybuy, di-lutingtheirbestideas. Asthe fund growslarger, itlooksmore like the overall mar-ket, and runsinto the iron lawofcosts.Asecond possibilityisthatactive man-agerstend to have a “style”, favouringpar-ticulartypesofshares. One style is thevalue approach, wherebyinvestorsseeksharesthatlookcheap compared with acompany’sproﬁts, assetsordividend pay-ments. Butstylescan go in and out offash-ion asrelative valuationschange; valuestockscan outperform fora while andthen slump. So managerswho followthatstyle will beattheirpeersfora period andthen drop to the backofthe pack.The ﬁnal possibilityisthatoutperfor-mance (orunderperformance) issimplythe resultofluck. Pickingsharesis enor-mouslydiﬃcult, given all the potentialfactorsinvolved. In the American stock-marketthousandsoffundspore over thesame information. Itisveryhard for an in-dividual investorto getan edge.Active fund managementmayhavemore ofa role to playin otherplaces:emergingmarkets, forexample, where in-formation aboutthe prospectsofindivid-ual companiesisnotso widelyavailable;orbond funds, where S&Pdid ﬁnd someevidence ofpersistentperformance in ar-eassuch asmortgage-backed securities,municipal debtand investment-gradedebt. In such areas, specialistknowledgemayprove an advantage. Butwhen itcomesto American equi-ties, itisa diﬀerentstory. The average fundmanagerrunsa portfolio foronlyaroundfour-and-a-halfyears. So ifyoupick afund based on itsrecord, the chances arethata newperson isin charge. The oldsayingthat“pastperformance isno guideto the future” isnota piece ofcompliancejargon. Itisthe truth.

Since Argentina hasdefaulted sixtimesin the past100 years, thatbeliefseemsbrave. Butinstead oflookingbackwards, investorsare lookingfromside to side, atthe miserable yields onoﬀerelsewhere. Argentina’s“century”bondsyield almost8%. Thatiscompara-ble to whatinvestorscan nowearn onan equallylong-dated bond issued in2015 byPetrobras, Brazil’sstate-owned oilcompany. And itisseveral percentagepointsmore than the yield on Mexicanbondsdue in 2110 orRussian paperduein 30 years’ time. Moreover, manyinvestorswill hopeto make a proﬁtlongbefore thisbelief inArgentina’s22nd-centurycreditworthi-nessistested. Iftheircase merely be-comesmore plausible (orifyieldselse-where prove disappointing), Argentina’sbond pricesare likelyto rise, allowingtheirholdersto sell ata proﬁt.

To itsmembers, runawayprice increases seem tolurkin everyoddlyshaped shadow. On June 14th America’scen-tral bankraised itsbenchmarkinterestrate forthe third time in sixmonths, even asinﬂation lingered belowits2% target, asithas formostofthe pastﬁve years. Some criticsreckon the Fed’s2% inﬂa-tion targetistoo constraining. Indeed, in recentcomments on aletterfrom prominenteconomistscallingfora highertarget, JanetYellen, the chairman, signalled opennessto the idea. But the Fed’sproblem islessitstargetthan an unforgivingpessimism aboutAmerican productivity. Ifitsbleakviewiswrong, the Fed itselfispartlyto blame forslowgrowth.Economistsgenerallytreatproductivitygrowth asa “real” fac-tor, outside central-bankcontrol. Thus, itisthoughtto depend onthingssuch astechnological progress, workers’ skill levelsandthe ﬂexibilityofthe economy. Butproductivitygrowth iscyclical:itvariesdependingon whetheran economyisboomingor bust-ing. Central banksmighttherefore have more inﬂuence over itthan theyare prepared to admit. Economieshave a growth speed limit, determined bychangesin population and productivity. When unemploymentishigh,the economycan growfasterthan thisspeed limitwithout an ac-celeration in inﬂation, since ﬁrmscan expand byhiring unem-ployed workers. Asthe numberofjoblessworkersshrinks, thisoption disappears. Eventually, ﬁrmshopingto growmust raisewagesto poach the workerstheyneed from othercompanies. Aswage costsrise, pricesmustgo up to coverthe bill, fuelling a cycleofacceleratinginﬂation. “The riskwould be thatthe economywould crash to a very, verylowunemploymentrate,” said Wil-liam Dudley, presidentofthe NewYorkFed, on June 19th, describ-inga scenario mostAmericansmayﬁnd lessthan horrifying.Yetbefore thatpointﬁrmshave otherwaysto manage in-creased demand. Theymightgive theircurrentworkersmorehours, orpush them to workharder. Some have the option to out-source workto foreign contractorsorinvestin robots. Even risingwagesneed nottranslate into higherinﬂation. Firmsmay chooselowerproﬁtsoverhigherpricesand reduced marketshare. Theymightalso pairwage increaseswith investmentin training andequipmentin orderto raise workers’ productivity. In an economyin which the central bankpermitsinﬂation to jump around, itshould be clearwhen these otheropportunitiesare exhausted:when inﬂation beginsto rise sharply. So longasinﬂation remainslowand stable, itispossible thatproductivity-boosting stepsarestill beinglefton the table. Could thisbe happeningnow? Some evidence suggestsso.Until the mid-1980sproductivitygrewfasterwhen a boom gath-ered pace; itslowed in recessions. Since then, the opposite hasbeen true; productivitygrowth leapsin recessionsand wheezesduringbooms. Structural changesin the economymayhelp ac-countforthischange. Increased labour-marketﬂexibility mightmake iteasierforﬁrmsto sackworkersin bad times, boosting av-erage productivity; theycan rehire low-skilled workers later. Butotherfactorsprobablymatteratleastasmuch, according to workpublished lastyearbyJohn Fernald, ofthe San Francisco Fed, andChristina Wang, ofthe Boston Fed. In particular, technology maybe contributingto economicﬂuctuationsin a newway. Routine proceduresAround the time productivitybegan to leap duringrecessions,America also began suﬀeringa rash ofjoblessrecoveries (seechart). In a paperpublished in 2015, NirJaimovich, ofthe Univer-sityofZurich, and HenrySiu, ofthe UniversityofBritish Colum-bia, argue thatthisisbecause ﬁrmsbegan respondingto reces-sionsbyeliminatingroutine jobs(like repetitive factory orcall-centre work) through reorganisation, outsourcingand auto-mation. Firmsused recessionsto implementlabour-saving struc-tural changesthatraised productivityand made iteasier to ac-commodate risingdemand in the earlystagesofa recoverywithouthiringnewworkers. The shiftto a low-inﬂation world can help to explain thisphe-nomenon. Firmstend notto cuttheirworkers’ nominal wages(the numberson the paycheque), and when inﬂation islow theycannotachieve such large savingsbykeepingpayconstant in theface ofrisingprices. Theytherefore have little choice butto makelay-oﬀs—and to take additional stepsto make the remaining, ex-pensive workersmore productive. Whatismore, technological progressitselfiscontractionary ifthe central bankdoesnotrecognise itisoccurring, according to aseminal paper, published in 2006, bySusanto Basu, ofBostonCollege, MrFernald and MilesKimball, ofthe University ofColo-rado. Newtechnologiesgenerallyreduce labourdemand and in-ﬂation in the shortrun. Thatwould notbe so ifcentral banksob-served thatthiswashappeningand responded with moreaccommodative policy. Theyrarelydo. The rare exception makesthe point. In March 1997 the Ameri-can economyseemed to be runningatclose to full tilt. Inﬂationwasjusta shade over2%. The unemploymentrate stood at5.2%.In the eyesofthe Fed, then run byAlan Greenspan, itwas verynearlytime to pull awaythe punchbowl. Yet, though the Fed vot-ed fora 0.25% interest-rate increase atthatmeeting, itsplan foraseriesofrate riseswassubsequentlyditched when itchanged itscollective mind. Unemploymenteventuallyfell below4%; sincethe early1980sno otherperiod hasmatched the late 1990sforgrowth in labourproductivityand real pay.The onlywayto knowifAmerica can manage a repeatperfor-mance isto testthe economy’slimits. The transition from a 2% tar-getto a higherone would oﬀera chance forsuch an experiment.Asitis, a central bankhell-benton keepinginﬂation lowand sta-ble riskscuttingshorta boom with room to run. 7Diminished expectationsThe jobless noughtiesSource: Bureau of Labour StatisticsUnited States, jobs per person, % change from recession trough022464803Months after recession troughMonths before recession trough6912151821243691215182124197019751982199120012009JanetYellen’s productivityscepticism could prove self-fulﬁllingFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchange65The Economist June24th2017PropertyThe EconomistJune24th2017671THE starting-pointofscience iscollect-ing: animals, plants, minerals, ele-ments, even stars. Then, once a collection islarge enough, patternsbegin to emerge.Animalsand plantsfall into phylogenetictrees, mineralsinto crystal groups, ele-mentsinto the periodictable, starsinto theHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Those pat-ternsboth require and suggestexplana-tion. Thus, the theoryofevolution, the sci-ence ofcrystallography, an understandingofthe chemical bond and a description ofhowstarsshine overtheirlifetimeshaveall emerged from the classiﬁcation of col-lections. Now, itappears, somethingsimi-larishappeningto planets.Aquarterofa centuryago onlynineplanetswere known—those ofthe SolarSystem, a numbersubsequentlyreducedto eightbythe demotion ofPluto. Thesenearbyworldshave, however, nowbeenjoined bythousandsmore thatorbitstarsotherthan the sun. Manyofthose havebeen discovered orconﬁrmed to exist byKepler, an American space telescopelaunched in 2009 with the speciﬁcaim ofﬁndingsmall, potentiallyEarth-like bo-Because Neptune’sdiameterisfourtimesEarth’s, however, thatisa biggap to ﬁll. Atthe top end ofthe range are so-calledmini-Neptunes. These are mostlygas, butare presumed to have coresmade ofrockand ice. Atthe bottom end are rockyob-jectswith little orno atmosphere. Theseare the largestofthe terrestrial planets,similarin composition to the innerplanetsofthe SolarSystem, and are sometimesknown assuper-Earths. Butifand how thetwo sortsoverlap hasneverbeen clear. Partofthe reason forthislackofclarity hasbeen a lackofaccurate measurementsofexoplanetarydiameters.Kepler, which worksbymeasuringthedip in a star’slightcaused bya planetpass-ingin frontofit, cannotdetermine the sizeofthatplanetdirectly. Rather, itmeasuresthe relative sizesofplanetand star. Astar’ssize isdeduced from itsspectrum. Hotstars, which shine white, are bigandbright. Cool ones, which shine red, aresmall and dim. There are exceptions—oldstarssuch asred giantsand white dwarfs—butthese are easilyrecognised. Thatthisrelationship between lumi-dies, asopposed to the plethora ofbig,heavy, Jupiter-like gasgiantsthatformedthe bulkofpreviousdiscoveries.On June 19th AndrewHoward oftheCalifornia Institute ofTechnologyand hiscolleaguesannounced the latestbatch ofKepler’sdiscoveries, 219 ofthem, includingten thatare aboutthe size ofEarth andhave similarsurface temperatures, andmightthusbe capable ofsupportinglife.Theyalso announced the resultofan anal-ysisofall ofKepler’shaul, the thrustofwhich isthatsmall planetsseem to comein two distincttypes. Which type a planetisdependson itsexactsize. Butthere isamarked discontinuitybetween the smallerand the largertype, which seemsto reﬂectthe waythatmassand chemical composi-tion interactin the swirlingcloudsof gasand dustthatform planetarynurseries.Mind the gapOne ofKepler’searlyﬁndingswasthatthere isan abundance ofobjectsinterme-diate in size between Earth, the ﬁfth-largestplanetin the SolarSystem, and Neptune,the fourth-largest(shown, to scale, above).ExoplanetsSortingthe skyThatplanets come in diﬀerentspecies is clear.

Theirdia-gram, which plotsitasa graph, isa good ex-ample ofdata collection producingpat-ternsfortheoreticiansto workon. Itmeans, forinstance, thata precise spec-trum will accuratelyindicate a star’ssizeand thus, ifthatstarisorbited bya Kepler-detected planet, the planet’sdiameter.Until recently, mostofthe stars aroundwhich Keplerhasmade such discoverieshad nothad theirspectra closelyanalysed.Thishasnowchanged thanksto the tele-scopes, amongthe largestin the world, ofthe Keckobservatoryin Hawaii. Usingthese, DrHoward and hiscolleagueshavemeasured the spectra, and thusthe sizes, of1,300 ofthese stars.Addingthe Keckand Keplerdata togeth-ershowsthe distinction between mini-Neptunesand super-Earthsquite clearly.The maximum diameterofrockyplanetsis1.75 timesthatofEarth. The smallestmini-Neptunesare twice the diameterofEarth. The gap between the two (a 50% dif-ference in volume) suggestsbodiesof in-termediate size are unstable.Turn down the volumeDrHoward and hiscolleaguessuspectthegap iscaused bythe wayplanetaryatmo-spheresform. Theircalculationssuggestthatthe jump between a rockyplanetwithlittle orno atmosphere and a mini-Nep-tune with a large one requiresthe additionofonlyabout1% ofthe planet’smass, in theform ofhydrogen and helium. Since theseare the two lightestelements, theyprovidelotsofvolume forlittle weight. And, sincetheyare the mostabundantelements, theyare readilyavailable.Beinglight, however, meanstheyareeasilylost. Thisiscrucial. DrHoward andhisteam reckon the lackofobjectsin thegap between the biggestrockyplanets andthe smallestmini-Neptunesisa conse-quence ofthe bodiesthatwould other-wise ﬁll ithavinginsuﬃcientgravity tohold onto theiratmospheres. Instead, radi-ation from theirparentstarsstripsthose at-mospheresaway.The large numberofmini-Neptunesaround (almosteveryplanetarysystemfound byKeplerhasatleastone) doesraisethe question ofwhythere are none in theSolarSystem. Thatwill require more study,with betterinstruments. And the progressofjustsuch an instrument, called PLATO,wasannounced bythe European SpaceAgencyon June 20th. Lift-oﬀisplanned for2026. PLATOwilllookforplanetsaround hundredsofthou-sandsofstars. Itsmain objective is to seekonesthatmightbe supportinglife. LikeKepler, though, itwill add enormously toastronomers’ planetcollection, and thus tothe developingscience ofplanetology.7MOSTnewhuman viral infectionscome from otheranimals. Ebola fe-ver, SARSand AIDSall started in this way.Animalsare also the sourcesofinﬂuenzaepidemics. Keepingan eye on birdsandbeasts, the virusestheycarry, and which ofthose virusesare found in people isthus aprudentthingto do. And thatisthe self-ap-pointed taskofthe EcoHealth Alliance, acharitable research organisation based inNewYork. Thisweeksome ofthe alliance’sscientists, led byKevin Olival, publishedthe resultsoftheirlatestresearch in Nature.Amongotherthings, theyattemptto esti-mate whatpeople do notknowaboutthese “zoonotic” viruses, aswell aswhattheydo.DrOlival’sstudyisrestricted to mam-mals. Itdoesnot, therefore, pertain tothingslike the sourcesofavian ﬂu. Butwithin thatlimititisascomprehensive asthe data allow. Itlooksatall 586 speciesofvirusknown to have been found in atleastone mammal. Those mammalsamountto754 species(humansincluded) from 15 or-ders—groupssuch asprimates, bats, carni-voresand even-toed ungulates(deer, cat-tle, sheep, antelopes, camelsand so on). Ofthe virusesstudied, 263 (ie, 45%) had beendetected in humansand 188 ofthose werezoonoticin the sense thattheyhad alsobeen found atleastonce in anothermam-mal species. Thisdoesnotprove a viruspassed from animal to human. Itcouldhave travelled the otherway. Butitis astarting-pointforresearch.The objectivesDrOlival and hiscol-leaguessetthemselveswere to build amodel thatpredicted howmanyzoonoticvirusesa particularanimal speciesmightbe expected to carry, and then to comparethatwith the numberalreadyknown to becarried byit. Theydid thisbyasking howcloselyrelated a specieswasto Homo sapi-ens(on the assumption thatviruseswillﬁnd the jump between related species eas-ier), and howlikely, given a species’ range,habitatand behaviour, itwould be for ittointeractwith people. Theyalso estimated,and attempted to correctfor, howmuch ef-forthad been putinto lookingforvirusesin a given species. Samplingbias, for exam-ple, almostcertainlyexplainswhysomanyknown virusesinfecthumans.All thisworkyielded an estimate ofthenumberofunknown zoonoticvirusspe-ciesoutthere in the world’smammals. Italso enabled the team to drawup “heatmaps” showingplaceswhere the actualand predicted numberofzoonoticvirusesleastresemble one another, and whichtherefore have the highestriskofspringinganastysurprise on the world.The biggestthreatcomesfrom bats,which carrymanymore zoonoticvirusesperspeciesthan othermammalian ordersdo.

Never-theless, manypoliticiansinsistthat theirstated beliefshave a moral basisratherthan a merelypragmaticone. And perso-nal convictionsaside, moralisinghasmanybeneﬁts: pastresearch suggests thatleaderswho make moral argumentsareseen ashavingbettercharacters, and thattheyare betteratpersuadingwaverers totheircause.Butall powercomesata price. As Ta-marKrepsofthe UniversityofUtah andhercolleaguesreport, in a paperto be pub-lished soon in the Journal ofPersonalityand Social Psychology, those who claimmoral ratherthan pragmaticreasonsfortheirpoliciesmayﬁnd themselvespun-ished more harshlybyvotersiftheylaterchange theirminds. DrKreps’sresearch involved 15 separateexperiments, conducted online throughAmazon’s“Mechanical Turk” service, inwhich people are paid commissionsforcompletingodd jobs. Each experimentfol-lowed a similarstructure. Participants readastatementfrom a hypothetical politicianeithersupportingoropposingsome con-troversial policy—the death penalty, say, orsame-sexmarriage. In some casesthe argu-mentswere made pragmatically, byap-pealingto economics. In otherstheyweremade on moral grounds, citingreasonssuch as“justice” or“respect”. The participantswere then invited torate the politician on hisperceived hypoc-risy, hiscourage, hisﬂexibility, his eﬀective-nessand hisworthinessofsupport. Final-ly, theyread a second statementfrom thesame politician sayingthathisorher posi-tion had nowchanged, and the ratingexer-cise wasrepeated. DrKrepsand hercolleaguestestedthree ideas. First, theywondered ifa leaderwho had changed hismind afteradoptingamoral position would seem more hypo-critical, and lesseﬀective, than one whohad justiﬁed hisinitial position on purelypragmaticgrounds. Changinga moralview, afterall, mightseem like breaking apromise. Second, and conversely, perhapschangingone’smind in such circum-stanceswould be seen asmorallycoura-geous, and therefore boostsupportamongthe public. Last, theyinvestigated whetherratingsdepended on a participant’sownbeliefs. Aleadercomingaround to one’sown viewmightbe viewed with more in-dulgence than one who had travelled inthe opposite direction. Aftertottingup the responses, the re-searcherswere leftwith ratingsfrom morethan 5,000 participants. The data showedstrongsupportforthe ﬁrsthypothesis—moraliserswho laterchanged theirmindwere indeed seen asmore hypocriticaland, therefore, lessworthyofsupport.There wasno evidence forthe idea thatchangingone’sposition on an ethical mat-terwould be seen asmorallycourageous.And there wasonlyslightsupportfor thepartisanship hypothesis—a resultthat sug-gestspeople are, perhaps, more fair-mind-ed than isoften assumed. These resultsheld notonlyin the aggre-gate, butalso in mostofthe individual ex-periments. Thissuggeststhe researchershave found a real pattern ratherthan beingmisled bya quirkofthe data. Those indi-vidual experimentscovered putative poli-ticiansand businesstycoons, personsmale and female, and the use ofboth writ-ten statementsand television advertise-ments. Some leaderswere described as de-pendenton popularsupport, othersasuninterested in it, in case dependencemade a change ofmind seem like pander-ing. The researcherscovered issuesfromgaymarriage and the death penaltyto im-migration, environmental policyand sexu-alised advertising. And theyalso looked attheirparticipants’ sexesand theirpersonalmoral stances. None ofthose factorsmademuch diﬀerence to the overall pattern. Climbing down gracefullyThe data did, however, suggesttwo tacticsthatmightsoften the reputational impactofchangingone’smind on a moral issue.The ﬁrstwasto attribute the change to atransformational personal experience. (“Ispentsome time with a death-rowinmateand sawwhata trulyunjustsystem wehave.”) Respondentsseemed to appreciatethe apparenthonestyinherentin such aconfession. The otherwassimplyto denythata true change ofopinion had takenplace, and instead explain the situationawaybycitingfactorsbeyond one’scon-trol. (“Mycolleaguesin the legislature haverefused to putthisissue on ouragenda.”)Moralisingleaderswho used such tacticsstill seemed like hypocrites. Butthey wererated asbeingslightlymore courageousthan those who did not. There are, asever, a fewcaveats. Hypo-thetical politiciansmaybe judged diﬀer-entlyfrom ﬂesh-and-blood ones. And allofthe participantswere American, and theissueswere framed in the contextofAmer-ican politics. Itmaybe thatthingswork dif-ferentlyin othercountries. Butaspiringpoliticiansshould take note. Morality ispowerful stuﬀ, and assuch should be usedwith care. Once a position hasbeen stakedouton moral grounds, itisextremely hardto change it, no matterhowgood the rea-sonsmaybe. 7Political moralityTalk is notcheapIfyou are a politician, changing yourconvictions could costyouTUBERCULOSIShasplagued humanityforthousandsofyears. The discoveryin the 19th centuryofitscause, a bacterium(pictured above) called Mycobacterium tu-berculosis, and the consequentdevelop-mentofbetterhygiene, helped bringthatplague undercontrol. Then, in themid-20th century, whatmanyhopedwould be the ﬁnal nail in itscoﬃn ap-peared: antibioticdrugs. Unfortunately, TBisback. Aftera fewdecadesin which antibioticsdid indeedseem to be workingmiracles, some strainsofM. tuberculosishave evolved resistanceto them. In 2015 5% ofthe world’s10m casesfailed to respond to treatmentwith isonia-zid and rifampicin, the drugsofﬁrst resort.Halfofthose non-responderswere infect-ed bystrainsofthe bacterium immune tosecond-line treatmentsaswell. Mostmi-crobiologistsregard these numbersas por-tentsofworse to come. Thatisdriving asearch fornewantibioticsagainstwhichM. tuberculosishasevolved no resistance. EshwarMahenthiralingam ofCardiﬀUniversityand GregChallisofthe Univer-sityofWarwick, both in Britain, think theyhave found one. Astheyand theircol-leaguesdescribe in the Journal ofthe Amer-ican Chemical Society, theyhave discov-ered a compound, produced byanotherbacterial pathogen, thatkillsresistantstrainsofM. tuberculosis.Thiscompound, which theycall gladio-lin, iscreated byBurkholderia gladioli—abacterium, generallyrare, thatthrives inthe lungsofthose suﬀeringfrom cystic ﬁ-brosis.

Thissuggestsitis engag-ingin chemical warfare.To isolate the agentthatinhibits B. gla-dioli’scompetitors, the researchersculti-vated samplesfrom a patientwith cystic ﬁ-brosisand analysed the chemicalssecretedbybacteria therein. Itwasthusthey discov-ered gladiolin, which shutsdown bacterialversionsofthe gene foran enzyme calledRNApolymerase thatiscrucial forlife. Thiswasinteresting. Butitwasalsoreminiscentofa false dawn involving an-othersubstance, etnangien, which was dis-covered in 2007 and which also inhibitsRNApolymerase. Unfortunately, etnan-gien proved chemicallyunstable and thusimpossible to use asa drug. The ﬁrst taskDrMahenthiralingam and DrChallisunder-tookwastherefore a detailed comparisonofthe two. Theyestablished thatthe partsofetnangien moleculeswhich cause theirinstabilityare notshared bygladiolin. Thatsuggested gladiolin mightindeed be robustenough foruse againsttuberculosis, andencouraged them to testitfurther. The newsubstance performed reason-ablywell againsta strain oftuberculosisthathad no resistance to antibiotics. Asol-ution of400 nanograms(billionthsofagram) permillilitre wasenough to inhibitthe growth ofsuch bacteria. Butisoniazidand rifampicin performed better. Theyneeded only40 nanogramsand 1nano-gram permillilitre ofsolution respectivelyto keep the non-resistantbugsundercon-trol. Where gladiolin did shine, though,wasagainsta strain oftuberculosisknownforitsresistance to isoniazid and rifampi-cin. Even 10,000 nanogramspermillilitreofeitherofthose two drugswasinsuﬃ-cientto harm it. However, a mere 1,700nanogramspermillilitre ofgladiolinproved enough to knockitout. Whethergladiolin can be taken out ofthe Petri dish and made into a useful drugwill require manyclinical trialsto discover.But, in a world cryingoutfornewantibiot-ics, itseemsa useful lead.7INTRODUCINGgenesforherbicide resis-tance into a crop permitsitto be sprayedwith weedkillerthatreallydoesthen killnothingbutweeds. Butthatworksonly un-til the weedsthemselvesdevelop resis-tance to the poison. One waythiscan hap-pen isthrough crossbreedingwith the croporiginallyprotected—a riskifweed andcrop are closelyrelated.Thatisthe case forrice, where weedy,natural varietiesare a perennial problembecause ofthe competition theybring tothe cultivarsfarmersactuallywantto raise.But, ashe describesin TransgenicResearch,LuBaorong, an ecologistatFudan Univer-sityin Shanghai, thinkshe hasfound a sol-ution. Byaddinga second transgene to thecrop, he can sabotage anyweed thatcross-breedswith it. DrLu’stransgene encodes agenetic“silencer” thatshutsdown the ex-pression ofa natural gene called SH4. Inwild grassesSH4promotesa phenomenoncalled “seed shattering” thatreleasesseedsfrom the stalkwhen theyare ripe. Domestication selectsagainstseedshatteringbecause farmerswantthe seedsto stayattached to a plantasitisharvested.The bestcereal cropsare those which donotrelease theirseedsuntil theyare delib-eratelythreshed. ThatmeansaddinganSH4silencerto them will, ifanything, makethem bettercropsratherthan worse ones.Indeed, experimentshowsthatthe silenc-erhasno eﬀecton the productivityof anotherwise geneticallyun-engineered culti-var, asmeasured bysuch thingsasthenumberofseed grainsperplant, theweightofthose grains, the percentage ofthem thatgerminate, and the survival ratesofthe resultingseedlings.Ifa silencer-enhanced version doescrossbreed with a weedyinterloper,though, the oﬀspringwill end up carryingthe silencer, too. And that, DrLuhoped,would damage them bystoppingtheirseedsbreakingoﬀnaturally, and thus pre-ventingthose seedsfrom spreading. To testhisidea, DrLuand hiscolleaguescrossbred a weedyrice strain with a culti-varinto which the silencertransgene hadbeen introduced. Theythen allowed thecrossbred oﬀspringto breed with one an-other, creatingsecond-generation hybridsofa sortthatmightemerge in the wild.Theyfound thatthe expression ofSH4inthose hybridsdropped sharply, to aslow as10%. Thatisa level similarto the one foundin cultivars. Thisreduction in SH4expres-sion wasaccompanied bya reduction inthe hybrids’ seed-shatteringindex, a mea-sure ofthe strength ofa plantstrain’sstalksand the numberofitsseedsin the soil. In arice-ﬁeld, the consequence would be thatthe weedygrainsgetharvested alongwiththose ofthe cultivar, removingthem fromcirculation and thussuppressingtheweedypopulation the followingseason. In the longterm, thatmightmake herbi-cidesobsolete. In the shorterterm, how-ever, DrLuhopesto make them more eﬀec-tive, bycreatinga cultivarin whichsilencersofSH4and, perhaps, otherseed-shatteringgenesare in close chromosomalproximityto the herbicide-resistance gene.Thatwill mean anytransferofherbicideresistance automaticallybringsseed-shat-teringproblemswith it, stoppingthespread ofherbicide resistance within theweedypopulation. Moreover, whatworkswith rice mightreasonablybe expected to work, too, withothercereals, such aswheatand sorghum,which also have close relativesthatbehaveasweeds. DrLu’ssubtle approach of, in ef-fect, domesticatingweedsin orderto de-stroythem, could therefore have a big in-ﬂuence on future crop yields.7AgricultureSilence, pleaseHowto getrid ofweeds bycrossing them with GM cropsShattered2The EconomistJune24th201771For daily analysis and debate on books, arts andculture, visitEconomist.com/culture1ASKmusic-loversto name a conductor,and amongthe greatstheyare likely tomention Arturo Toscanini.

Thisprovoked furyamongItalianswho came to the opera house notto listenbutto ﬂirtand eatice cream. Like Wagner,he wanted the orchestra in a pitbelow thesingersratherthan on the stage, especiallyimportantwhen performingthe bombas-ticworksofVerdi orWagner, so asnot tooverpowerthe singers. La Scala’sﬁrstor-chestra pitwasconstructed in 1907. Tosca-nini celebrated byperformingWagner’s“Götterdämmerung”.Alongside thislengthyexamination ofToscanini’sapproach to music, MrSachstreatsthe readerto a bitofgossip. Toscaninihad a voracioussexual appetite and innu-merable lovers. MrSachshasdugoutlet-terswhich Toscanini exchanged withwomen all overthe world. Some drip withsexual innuendo.Ofhis timeMrSachsalso usesToscanini’slife asa win-dowonto a widerdiscussion ofmusicaland historical themes. He documentsTos-canini’smanyperformancesin Argentina,then one ofthe world’srichestcountries.And hisportraitofthe musicscene in turn-of-the-centuryItalyisfascinating. Musi-cianswould compete to sitin the presti-giousseatsin the orchestra; the police weresometimesneeded to breakup ﬁghts. Au-dienceswould aggressivelydemand en-coresofthe entire performance ifthey had he knewthe entire workfrom memory.Before longhe wasleadingensemblesall overthe world, usuallyto rave reviews.Criticspraised Toscanini’sinterpretationsforhewingcloselyto composers’ inten-tions. Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, a nowalmostunknown composer, satin asToscaniniperformed one ofhispieces, gushing, “Icome here to heareverysingle nuance, ev-erybitofphrasingthatI intended, ex-pressed bythismarvellousman.”The pursuitofperfection did not comewithoutcosts, however. Toscanini sleptbarelyﬁve hoursa nightand wentfor longstretcheswithoutseeinghischildren, towhom he did notthinkitworth histime toimparthismusical knowledge. Andthough MrSachslaysto resta long-stand-ingmyth thatToscanini once blinded a vio-linistin a ﬁtofrage, tantrumswere certain-lycommon. Toscanini had equallystrongviews onthe meritsofdiﬀerentcomposers. As hegotolder, he had little time forthe worksofArnold SchönbergorBela Bartok(thoughhe did enjoyconductingStravinsky).

Orthe precise mountain thatToscanini climbed while on holiday? Afterseeingten newspaperreviewsheapingpraise on Toscanini, no one will doubt hisgreatness.

Asa studyofthe life and times ofoneofthe greatestconductorsofall time, thisbookwill notsoon be bettered.7UBERwashavinga bad week: accusa-tionsofsexism in the ride-hailingcompanyhad turned itfrom a Silicon Val-ley“unicorn” into somethingmore ofanogre. Matterswere nothelped bya boardmeetingto discussthe mess. Arianna Huf-ﬁngton, a director, cited research showingthatthe likelihood ofa board bringing onawoman ishigherifitalreadyhas atleastone female member. David Bonderman,hercolleague, quipped thatthiswouldjustmean more talking. He laterapolo-gised and quit.Some mightquietlygrumble that,rude ornot, MrBonderman had a point. Itiswidelythoughtin the Westthatwomentalkmore than men. One popular-sciencebookcalled “The Female Brain” said theyuse three timesasmanywordsperday asmen. Maybe thatiswhysenatorskept in-terruptingKamala Harris, a Californiansenator, duringherquestioningofJeﬀSessions, America’sattorney-general, atahearingon June 13th. OrwhyJim Holt,hostinga panel on cosmologyata sciencefestival in NewYork, repeatedlytalkedoverVeronika Hubeny, the one woman inthe group. Women will talkforever ifyoudon’tstop them.Exceptthatthere isnota whitof evi-dence thattheydo. AbbyKaplan, a lin-guistatthe UniversityofUtah, roundedup the factsin “Women TalkMore ThanMen...And OtherMythsAboutLanguageExplained”, published lastyear. Research-ershave given men and women in groupsataskto complete, observed classroom in-teractions, required mixed-sexgroups toreach a jointpolitical agreement, and re-corded romanticpartnersin theirhomes.No studyhasshown women talkingmore, and some (like the romantic-coup-lesstudy) found them talkingrather less.In the beststudyofa large sample ofnatural speech, researchersrecorded sixgroupsofuniversitystudents(ﬁve inAmerica, one in Mexico) wearingdevicesthatwould randomlyswitch on and recordthem overthe course ofseveral days. Theresult? Membersofboth sexesspoke a sta-tisticallyindistinguishable average ofaround 16,000 wordsdaily. Thisaveragewasdwarfed bydiﬀerenceswithin eachsex, with some taciturn typesspeaking justafewthousand words, and a fewmotor-mouthsasmanyas50,000.Yetpeople hearwomen talkingmore—and cleverresearchershave proved thattoo. When theyplayed scripted conversa-tionsin which male and female speakerstookperfectlybalanced speakingtimes, re-spondentsheard the woman taking55% ofthe speakingtime (even when the maleand female actorsswapped scripts). Whydo people hearwomen talkingmore? Perhapsbecause women and menspeakdiﬀerently. Forthis, there is some evi-dence. In some studies, women take morespeakingturns, butmen take longer ones.In one study, women were more likely tooﬀerreactions(“yeah” or“that’sright”)and men more likelyto oﬀeranswers. Some linguists, like Deborah TannenofGeorgetown University, argue thatwomen and men tend to have diﬀerentgoalswhen talking: men are more likelyto seekstatusand exchange information,whereaswomen are more likelyto seekconnection and exchange aﬃrmation.Thisviewhasitsdetractors, buteven itsproponentsinsistthatthisgeneralityhardlyappliesto all men and women. Iftrue, thiswould help explain eventssuch asMrHolt’sinterruptionsofProfes-sorHubeny, often derided as“man-splaining”. Ifone partnerin a conversa-tion isseekingdominance and the otherisseekingco-operation, the status-seekerwill wind up hearingco-operative con-versational turnsassubmissive. Thatmayexplain whypeople thinkwomentalkmore: in the stereotype, itseems theyare natteringon with no clearpurpose. Speakersofboth sexesneed the fullsuite ofskills: explaining, problem-solv-ing, interrupting, supportingand more.Some people thinkthatwomen are justbiologicallybetteratone kind, and menatanother. Culture, though, explainsplenty, too. It’snoteverywhere thatmenare expected to be the blunt, competitive,problem-solvingsexand women thecomforters. In rural Madagascar, men areprized forkabary: ﬂowery, indirectspeechthatavoidsputtingotherpeople on thespot, a mode thatisthoughtto be beyondwomen’sabilities. And in the village ofGapun in Papua NewGuinea, womenspecialise in the kros, an elaborate tiradepacked with sexual profanitydelivered atsomeone who haswronged her. Westernmen and women can learn plentyfromthese examples—and from each other.ChattyCathyand Taciturn TomJohnsonWestern ideas aboutwomen’s and men’s speech is shotthrough with myths and biasesThe EconomistJune24th2017 Booksandarts73FEWdoubtthatsomethingbighappenedin Western politicsduringthe past 12monthsbutnobodyissure what.

Thisisa piece ofperformance artatSkulpturProjekte Mün-ster(SPM), a festival thattakesplace once adecade, designed to presentcutting-edgecontemporarysculpture, though thisis notsculpture in the conventional sense. Theartistdescribesthe performersas“humansearch engines”.ThisyearSPM coincideswith a series ofothereventsthattogetherprovide a un-ique snapshotofcontemporaryart. Docu-menta, considered bymanyto be the criti-cal centre ofthe contemporary-artworld,takesplace in Kassel everyﬁve years (thisyearitpresented an earlyversion in Athensin April). In 2017 art-lovershave also hadthe choice ofthe Venice Biennale aswell asArtBasel in Switzerland, the mostimpor-tantmodern and contemporary-artfair. Allﬁve showsthisyearare placingan empha-sison performance. Performance artisover100 yearsold.Until recently, though, itwasa niche activi-ty. In the earlydecadesofthe 20th century,the Italian Futuristssawtheirworkas awayto reach a massaudience directly. TheDadaistsborrowed heavilyfrom popularculture, includingcabaretand music-hall. Butperformance artismostassociatedwith the conceptualism ofthe 1960sand1970s, in which the idea wasmore impor-tantthan the execution. And NewYork hasbeen the centre ofmodern performancesince those grungybeginnings, when VitoAcconci notoriouslymasturbated, heardbutunseen, foreighthoursa dayunder awooden ramp atthe Sonnabend Gallery. Performa, a biennial festival in NewYorkdevoted to performance art, isnowconsidered a must-see. Marina Abramovic,probablythe mostfamouslivingperfor-mance artistafterAi Weiwei, hopesto setup a permanentteachinginstitute in up-state Hudson. Itwill ﬁll a gap: few artschoolsteach performance. And the Shed,acentre forperformance and otherexperi-mental artforms, will open in the Chelseadistrictin NewYorkin 2019.Earlymodern performance artwaspo-litical—inspired bythe Vietnam war, thecivil-rightsmovement, the 1968 riotsand asecond wave offeminism. And manyart-ists, especiallythose disillusioned with theartmarket, made itintentionallydiﬃcult.AsCarolee Schneemann, an Americanfeministartist, wrote: “In 1963, to use mybodyasan extension ofmypainting-con-structionswasto threaten the psychic terri-torial powerlinesbywhich women wereadmitted to the ArtStud Club.”Butthe workthatpropelled perfor-mance from minorityto mainstream cameoutofthatdiﬃculttradition. In 2010 MsAbramovicputon a piece called “The Art-istisPresent” atthe Museum ofModernArt(MoMA) in NewYork. She satmotion-lessin a chairforseven hoursa day and in-vited membersofthe publicto sitoppositeand gaze into herface. Fully700 hourslat-er, she had faced 1,400 people from min-utesto whole days, while 500,000 morelooked on. Millionshave watched a videoofthe momentwhen herformerlover, aperformance artistnamed Ulaywithwhom she made manyofherearlyworks,turned up unexpectedly. Both struggled tocontain theirtears.Historical parallelshelp explain the re-surgentinterestin performance. The Futur-istsand Dadaistswere preoccupied withmachines, while today’sartistsfocusoncomputers. Some also see comparisonsbe-tween the turbulence ofthe 1970sand to-day’sinstabilities. Documenta dealsex-plicitlywith such political themes. InKassel a small group ofvisitorswasropedtogetherand instructed to communicatewith a group in Athenswhile the restlooked on. Designed to make the partici-pantsthinkabout“them” and “us”, powerrelationshipsand the diﬃcultyofcommu-nication, itproved unexpectedlystressfulforthose inside the cordons.Into the nowAsperformance artbecomesmore popu-lar, itischanging. Manyare embracing ele-mentsofdance, ﬁlm, theatre and sculpture,even streettheatre and rap music. “Perfor-mance artwasstuckin the 1970s: protest,people cuttingthemselves,” RoseLee Gold-berg, the founderofPerforma, said lastyear. “Some yearsago I wondered: whydon’twe have visuallydazzling, emotionaland intellectuallychallengingperfor-mance? Whydoeseverythinghave to be asingle gesture performed on the LowerEastSide?”Since then Shirin Neshat, DougAitken,MatthewBarneyand MsAbramovichaveall produced lavish, powerful works. In2011RagnarKjartansson, an Icelandicart-ist, presented “Bliss” atPerforma. Are-enactmentofthe ﬁnal aria ofMozart’s“Marriage ofFigaro” performed repeatedlybyten opera singersand a small orchestrafor12 hours, itcemented hisreputation asan artistgeneratingunusual excitement.One ofthe highlightsofBasel thisyear wasawork(pictured) byThan Hussein Clark,an emergingartist. The performancemixed theatre, dance, sound and poetry ina1930smodernistchurch. Some visitors,enchanted, stayed forthe full fourhours.Collecting, showingand restaging per-formance artisstill diﬃcult. Bob Rennie, aCanadian collector, needed 279 athletestoshowMartin Creed’sWorkNo. 850 (“Run-ners”) forthree monthsto the publicin hisprivate museum. Butsuch artaddsmuch-needed life and a social dimension to gal-leriesand museums. KlausBiesenbach,the curatorwho staged MsAbramovic’sMoMAshow, saysthatperformance artlooksdiﬀerentto youngerpeople used toﬁlmingthe world around them, and con-stantlypostingand checkingsocial mediato see whatelse hashappened. “Itisone ofthe reasonsthateven atartfairs, perfor-mance-, participation- and time-based arthasbecome partofthe norm,” he believes.Asartistsexplore the full range ofpossibili-ties—from single gesture to Wagner-style“total theatre”—a new, largelyanaloguemedium hasemerged to speakto today’sdigital age. 7Performance artBodytalkBASEL, KASSEL AND MÜNSTERArich artform becomes mainstreamHave you heard about the latest thing?75The Economist June24th2017FX & Gaming LicensesSwedish TrustsPayment Processing SystemsOffshore BanksInstant Citizenships & Residencieswww.global-money.comwww.gmccitizenships.comHELLENIC REPUBLIC ASSET DEVELOPMENT FUND S.A.The Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund S.A.

Opioids are used lessthan some other drugs (cannabis comestop), but they are the most harmful,accounting for 70% of global healthproblems attributed to drug-use dis-orders.

TheﬁrstAmericanshe metgave himsweets. Had the wargone on longer, hewould have been ﬁghtingthem.HelmutKohl wasalwaysconsciousofhisgood luckin havingmissed all that—dieGnade derspäten Geburt, the mercyofalate birth, washowhe putitto the IsraeliKnessetin 1984. In thatsense he wasGer-many’sﬁrsttrulypost-warpolitician. Hispredecessorswere all personallybur-dened byitshistory: Konrad Adenauerwasa political prisonerunderHitler; Lud-wigErhard risked persecution; KurtKie-singerwasa Nazi Partymember; WillyBrandtwasin Swedish exile, and HelmutSchmidtfoughton the eastern front.The careerpolitician from the Rhine-land wasanothermatter. Histimespushedhim neitherto heroism norto villainy. Buttheyoﬀered plentyofscope forhisambi-tion, cunningand vision. Hisformative ex-perience wasthe post-wareconomicmir-acle, the Wirtschaftswunder. WestGer-manywentfrom ruinsto riches, and frombeinga defeated pariah to a trusted ally. MrKohl’stask, when he tookoverthe federalchancelleryin 1982, wasto ﬁnish the job.When he leftoﬃce in 1998, Germanywasreunited, and friends—forthe ﬁrsttime—with everyneighbour. The capital wasaboutto move from sleepyBonn to imperi-al Berlin. Russian forceshad pulled out ofEurope and NATOhad oﬀered member-ship to Poland, the Czech RepublicandHungary. Europe’ssingle currency, theeuro, wasa done deal. Onlyten years earli-er, anyofthatwould have seemed thewildestfantasy. And in everyone ofthosechangesMrKohl played a decisive role.Hisgiantgirth wasmuch mocked: hisnickname wasdie Birne(“the Pear”). Butpeople underestimated him attheirperil.Hisunabashed provincialism grated withmodern-minded Germanswho expectedtheirpoliticiansto be cerebral, culturedand cosmopolitan. He spoke no foreignlanguage, and some said hisGerman waspoor, too. He displayed onlya token inter-estin art, musicand literature. His personallife wasfraught: hislong-suﬀeringwifeHannelore committed suicide in 2001.Outside politics, hismain interestwasfood: solid German fare, and plentyof it.Asked ifanythinginterrupted hissleep, hesaid itwasnight-time foraysto the fridge. Butnone could match him on tactics,whetherinside hisChristian DemocraticUnion oron the widerpolitical stage. Anearlyﬂash ofgeniuscame in the run-up tothe 1980 election, when he stepped asidefrom the contestto make wayforhisbrainyBavarian rival, Franz-Joseph Strauss. Theman from Munich suﬀered a thumpingde-feat—clearingthe wayforMrKohl to takeoverasconservative leader. In 1982 he ex-pertlysplitMrSchmidt’scoalition, win-ningthe election which followed. His holdlasted forthe next16 years.He tookovera troubled country. TheBaader-Meinhofterroristshad shatteredWestGermany’sself-image oftoleranceand stability. MrKohl’sson Walterwasanindirectvictim: intrusive securitymeanthe neverhad a normal childhood, he saidin a miserable, causticmemoir. WestGer-manywasdivided overdefence (whetherto acceptAmerican medium-range nuclearmissiles) and aboutnuclearpower. Socialchanges, especiallyfeminism, were shak-ingup society, while the division of Ger-manyseemed eternal.ButMrKohl exuded certainty. He bull-dozed hiswaythrough assorted scandals.Pursuinghisown Ostpolitik, he shockeddiehard anti-communistsbyinvitingEastGermany’sleader, Erich Honecker, to visit.European integration washispassion,marked bya notable bond with France’spresident, FrançoisMitterrand; the twomen held handsata commemoration ofthe slaughteratVerdun. Yetall such eﬀortswere framed bythe central and unshak-able alliance with America. He invitedRonald Reagan to honourGermany’swardead ata militarycemetery—a step too far,manythought, when itturned outthatsome SS men were buried there too. Onlywith MargaretThatchercould hestrike no chord. When she washolidayingin hisfavourite lakeside resorthe cut shortameeting, pleading“unbreakable commit-ments”. Walkingdown the streetlater, Brit-ain’sleadersawMrKohl in a café, busyonlywith a large cream cake. Theirrela-tionship neverrecovered.Too big a sliceHispolitical skillswere notalwaysmatched byjudgment. Powerpoliticswiththe Kremlin washisforte, notdealing withdissidents. Manyin the ex-communistworld, perhapsunfairly, found him remoteand unsympathetic. He insisted thatEastGermans’ worthlessmoneyshould beswapped forDeutschmarksata ratio ofone forone. Thatwaspopularatﬁrst, butsoon destroyed both the easterners’ com-petitivenessand theirjobs. The euro wasapolitical masterstroke, buthe ignoredwarnings, prescientin retrospect, that acommon currencyneeded common politi-cal foundations. Gerhard Schröder, his So-cial Democratnemesis, inherited (and re-formed) an ossiﬁed German economy.Although he made Germanyinto Eu-rope’sleader, he disliked the controversy itprovoked. He laterdisowned hisprotégéeAngela Merkel—dasMädchen (“the girl”),ashe called her. “She ismakingmyEuropekaputt,” he complained, with unfeignedproprietorial anguish. 7Germany’s helmsmanHelmutKohl, who piloted his countryand Europe through reuniﬁcation, died onJune 16th, aged 87 ObituaryHelmut KohlFeatured speakers:KELLY O’DWYERAssistant treasurer and minister for revenue and ﬁ nancial services AustraliaGREG MOSHALFounder and joint chief executive o(cid:30)  cerProspaSIMON CANTManaging director Reinventure GroupGERARD FLORIANGroup executive, technologyANZinnovationascompetition.economist.com@EconomistEvents #AusInnovRegister today to attend: asiaevents@economist.com+852 2585 3312Platinum sponsorWhere is Australia’s Alipay?Australian ﬁ ntech is booming.
