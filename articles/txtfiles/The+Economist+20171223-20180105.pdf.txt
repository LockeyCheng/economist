Aman accused ofgropingseveralwomen tookoﬃce in the WhiteHouse. (Donald Trump dis-missed the allegations—aswellasa tape ofhim boastingabouthisbehaviour, which he called mere “locker-room talk”.) The yearisendingsomewhatbetter. In OctoberHarveyWeinstein, a ﬁlm producer, wasaccused ofhavingspent de-cadesharassingand assaultingactresses, and usinghis exaltedposition in Hollywood to intimidate and silence anyone whogotin hisway. He wasforced outofthe ﬁrm he co-founded andisbeinginvestigated bypolice. Furtheraccusationsagainst oth-erpowerful men followed, spreadingbeyond Hollywood intopolitics, journalism and the tech industry. Dozenswere sackedorstepped down. Millionsofwomen were inspired to sharetheirown experience ofharassment, usingthe hashtags #Me-Too, #YoTambien, #BalanceTonPorcand so on. In a ﬁtting endto a yearofcomeuppances, RoyMoore, who isaccused of har-assmentand assaultbyseveral women, includingone whowas14 atthe time, became the ﬁrstRepublican to be defeatedin a Senate race in Alabama since 1992.#MeToo drewattention to a facetofwomen’slivesto whichmen had been comfortablyoblivious. Itshowed howcom-mon harassmentis, and howharmful to women’scareers. Butthe lesson from bigsocial changesin the pastisthat moreneedsto happen if2017 isto marka permanentshiftin behav-iour. Even now, Hurricane Harveycould blowitselfout andwomen atworkonce again be assailed byall the old abuses.Winds ofchangeIfhistoryisa guide, a newsocial norm takesrootwhen a seriesofsmallerchangesprepare the ground (see page 81). Firstaneventgalvanisesa group ofevangeliststo throwlight on an in-justice thatisacknowledged onlyin the shadows—the extentofdomesticabuse, say, orthe factthatgaypeople are accusedofthreateningpublicmoralswhen theylead perfectly ordin-arylives. Sometimesnewattitudesbringabouta change in thelaw, aswith the introduction ofProhibition and the reform ofcivil rightsin America. Butthe newlawwill stickonly so longaslarge partsofthe population embrace it. Prohibition failedbecause too fewAmericansagreed thatall drinkingwas de-bauched. People also need to see thattransgressionsare pun-ished—eitherdirectlybythe police, or, more often, by the massofbystanderswho choose to acteitherasenforcersor en-ablers. Mostcountrieswhere female genital mutilation iscom-mon have lawsagainstit. Theyare simplynotenforced. The signsare thatthe #MeToo movementhasreached a del-icate stage. The buﬀetingofthe pastfewmonthshas certainlybeen cathartic. Ithasalso broughtabusersin a bewilderingrange ofindustrieskickingand screaminginto the open. Butthe noveltyofseeingfamousmen broughtdown will soonfade. Before thathappens, both men and women need tocome to a shared understandingofwhatsexual harassment isand whatto do aboutit. Iftoo manyofthem conclude thatcomplaintsare beingexaggerated orexploited, theywill notstep in to stop backsliders. Minortransgressionswill be al-lowed to carryon. Thatwill make itmore likelythat rape andsexual assaultgo unpunished, too.Startwith whatcountsasharassment. Mostpeople can seethe harm in a man tradinga promotion forsex, in sexual as-saultorin crude groping. The divisionsstartwith unwantedpropositions, leering, sexualised put-downsand the like, par-ticularlybya man who isin a powerful position. What men tryto laugh oﬀasa compliment, ora joke, often feelslike humilia-tion orbullyingto women—and maywell be intended as such.Accusationscan casta shadowoversomeone’sreputation, sothe lackofclarityoverwhatisappropriate and what isnotcanbe unsettling. Men and women maywonderhowtheyaresupposed to knowwhethera ﬂirtation will be welcomed orwill be the prelude to a career-threateningexposure. Alackofdue processonlyaddsto the uncertainty.Despite thisabsence ofagreement, the evidence suggeststhateven lessseriousharassmentcausesharm. Astudy pub-lished in May, which followed the careersofa cohort ofwom-en in Minnesota, found that11% had been harassed in somewayin a single year. The victimswenton to earn less than oth-erwomen; ofthose who had been verballyabused repeatedlyorphysicallytouched atleastonce, 79% leftthe companywith-in two years. Thatisnotonlywrong—in the waythatall bully-ingiswrong—butalso a waste ofvaluable talent.Once there isa consensusaboutwhatiswrongand why,the newnormsmustbe enforced. Thisisunlikelyto involve achange in the law. Rape and sexual assaultare already illegal;discrimination and bullyingatworkare subjectto employ-mentlaw. Whatneedsto change isthe tacitcomplicity ofman-agersand staﬀ. HRdepartmentsoften defend the boss—espe-ciallyifhe isseen asa rainmaker, asMrWeinstein was.Managerswantto keep theirstaremployees, even ifthey aretoxic, because theyappearto do so much forthe team.Those mayturn outto be false economies—certainly, theywere with MrWeinstein, who broughtaboutthe collapse ofhisﬁrm. When youtotup the costsofall the women wholeave, neverjoin orworklesswell, the harassingstar maynotbe so valuable afterall.AnewagendaTo change behaviour, the newstandardsmustbe enforced.Women who make complaintsshould notbe brushed oﬀ, bul-lied into droppingthem orgagged bysettlementswith non-disclosure clauses—one idea isthatﬁrmsshould be obliged totell investorshowmanysuch agreementstheyhave made. Theentertainmentindustry, which appearsso farto be an arch-oﬀender, needsto reﬂecthard aboutwhetherthatis related tothe lackofwomen producersand directors.Ultimately, however, much ofthe taskwill fall to peers. Menneed to be alertand to step in where necessary. Women needto stand up foreach other. Too manypeople have been blind toaproblem hidden in plain sight. ButHurricane Harvey hasraged through 2017 and ignorance isno longeran excuse. 7The yearofHurricane HarveyRevelations have felled some powerful and predatorymen. Will the change be permanent?Leaders12LeadersThe EconomistDecember23rd20171ONDECEMBER18th SouthAfrica’srulingpartypickedaleader. The newhead ofthe Af-rican National Congress(ANC)isCyril Ramaphosa, one ofthehandful ofheroeswho negotiat-ed the peaceful dismantlingofapartheid in the 1990s. In 2019he will probablybe elected presidentofSouth Africa. Itisab-surd—and a sign ofhowpoisonousANC politicshave be-come—thathisrivalswithin hisown partydismisshim asatool of“white monopolycapital”. Thathe won the party’stopjob anywayshowsthatthere isstill hope forSouth Africa. The choice should have been simple. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, the candidate backed byJacob Zuma, the country’scur-rentpresident, promised more ofthe same. UnderMrZuma’sadministration, corruption thrives, state resourceshave beenlooted and democraticinstitutionshave been undermined. Byone estimate, asmuch as150bn-200bn rand ($11bn-15bn), or5%ofGDP, hasbeen misappropriated. MsDlamini-Zuma (who isMrZuma’sex-wife) hasremained almostentirelysilent aboutwhatSouth Africanscall “state capture”. In a 4,200-wordspeech kickingoﬀhercampaign, she did notmention corrup-tion once. Manytookthisto mean that, ifelected, she wouldshield MrZuma from prosecution on the 783 countsofcorrup-tion thathe faces. She also vowed to curtail the independenceofthe central bank, putmore people on the publicpayroll, ﬁghtthe dreaded white monopolycapital and achieve “radical eco-nomictransformation” byrampingup state spendingand ex-propriatingland, minesand businesses. MrRamaphosa, bycontrast, promised “moral renewal”. Hehasbeen deputypresidentsince 2014, butisuntarred bythemurkaround MrZuma. In almosteverycampaign speech, hepledged to ﬁghtcorruption. Unionsbacked him (he is a formerunion boss). Businessfolkbacked him, too (he isa tycoon withareputation forpragmatism). Pollssaid he wasfarmore popu-larwith ordinaryvoters. Yethisvictorywasterrifyingly nar-row: fewerthan 200 votesamongalmost5,000 partydele-gates. Had the courtsnotdisqualiﬁed more than 400illegitimate delegates, manyofthem from provincessupport-ingthe Zumas, MrRamaphosa would surelyhave lost. Nowforthe hard partHavingaverted the entrenchmentofa dismal dynasty, he mustsetaboutundoingthe damage MrZuma haswrought. The ﬁrststep should be to remove him from oﬃce. MrZuma would or-dinarilyexpectto serve anotheryearand a halfaspresident.Thatwould be a disaster, asitwould give the vultures aroundhim yetmore time to pickthe bonesofthe state. MrRama-phosa should immediatelypressthe ANCto recall MrZuma. IfMrZuma failsto heed hisparty’swishes, MrRamaphosashould urge a no-conﬁdence motion in parliament. Asdeputypresident, he would be nextin line. He should appoint a cred-ible head ofpublicprosecutionswho can decide whether topressthose 783 chargesofcorruption againstMrZuma. Heshould also setup a judicial commission ofinquiryto probe al-legationsofstate capture.MrZuma will ﬁghtback. He haspowerful alliesamong theANC’snewseniorleadership, and amongthose who beneﬁtfrom cronyism. Graftin South Africa nowrunswide anddeep—even head teachersare murdered so thattheirsucces-sorscan gain accessto the tinyschool budgetstheycontrol.Cleaningall thisup will notbe easy. Butitisnotimpossible, ifMrRamaphosa demonstratesthatthose in charge do not haveimpunity. Hiselection could mean a newstartforSouth Africa.The rand surged on newsofhisvictory. Otherinvestors willwaitand see whetherhe isseriousaboutreform. OrdinarySouth Africanswill praythathe is. 7South Africa’s next presidentNice one, CyrilThe rejection ofthe Zuma dynastyrestores hope to the rainbownationCRITICSofDonald Trump of-ten charge thathe isa manwithoutprinciples. Thatis un-fair. When itcomesto one terri-ble idea—hisconviction thatAmerica isstupid to wanttolead a rules-based global order—the presidentisstrikingly consis-tent. Backin 1987, weeksafterRonald Reagan startled the worldbycallingon Sovietleadersto teardown the Berlin Wall, MrTrump placed full-page advertisementsin majornewspapersexpressinga bleakerworldview. In an open letterto the Ameri-can people, MrTrump, then a propertydeveloperwith a ﬂairforpublicity, called forhiscountryto showmore “backbone”abroad. He accused Japan and otherAmerican alliesof “bril-liantly” manipulatingtrade and currencyﬂowsto growrich,while enjoyingmilitarysecurityfoolishlyprovided by Ameri-ca atno charge. MrTrump concluded: “Let’snotletourgreatcountrybe laughed atanymore.”On December18th PresidentDonald Trump launched hisNational SecurityStrategy(NSS)—a high-level plan forkeepingAmerica safe thateach administration mustproduce by law—and bragged thathis“America First” doctrine waswinningthecountryrenewed respect, afteryearsofdisastrousdealmakingand failure byhispredecessors. In fact, despite a few ﬂour-ishes, the NSSpavesthe wayto a diminished role forAmerica—America’s National Security StrategyDefendingAmerica, Donald Trump’s wayThe president’s newsecuritystrategymagniﬁes small threats and minimises big onesEASE AND FULFILMENTHOW MALAYSIA IS ENABLING THE GROWTH OF E-COMMERCEADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTOne startling feature of development in the 21st century has been the way emerging markets are using electronic commerce to leapfrog phases that richer countries went through long ago. In Asia and around the world, people who may previously have been in unskilled agrarian or manual labour, often in geographical isolation, are embracing the possibilities brought by mobile telecommunications and selling products directly to local and overseas buyers.Malaysia is already well ahead in its growth trajectory, with the goal of becoming a fully developed country by 2020. As such, it not only has a strong domestic e-commerce market, but is a leader for countries in the region. With 15.3m online shoppers—half the population—Malaysia has a broad base of e-consumers ready to buy everything from clothes to books and electronics online. The e-commerce industry is projected to grow by up to $27 billion by 2020, contributing 6.4% of GDP. This vigorous growth owes much to collaboration between government and the private sector, as well as to a strong postal and logistics network that enables e-fulﬁ lment and makes it easier to do business.One global ﬁ rm ﬂ ourishing in Malaysia is Lazada, part of a group founded by a German internet company and now controlled by Alibaba. An e-commerce pioneer in South-East Asia, Lazada operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam, giving shoppers an effortless buying experience and connecting retailers with the region’s largest online customer base.“We applaud the government of Malaysia for continuously underlining e-commerce as a primary driver for building a digitised economy,” says Hans-Peter Ressel, the chief executive of Lazada Malaysia. And through its #EveryoneCanSell initiative, Lazada is trying to pay some of that support forward by offering new sellers access to beneﬁ ts including training and ﬁ nancial support. “We hope to boost SMEs’ capabilities so they remain competitive online,” Mr Ressel says.With the growth of e-commerce, postal and logistics services are stepping up to the expectations that come with their increased importance to business. “Malaysia, a developing nation with a huge appetite for internet use and government incentives, has all the factors to propel an e-commerce leap,” says Shamsul Majid, head of e-commerce at Pos Malaysia, a postal services company. “Pos Malaysia was recently selected to operate the only e-fulﬁ lment hub in Malaysia’s Digital Free Trade Zone to beneﬁ t international and local e-commerce players and customers.” With its network of 1,000 touchpoints countrywide, including self-service terminals, mobile outlets and postal agents, Pos Malaysia acts as the physical link between buyers and sellers, supporting e-commerce on a foundation of strong e-fulﬁ lment capabilities.World-leading innovators in e-commerce, supported by robust e-fulﬁ lment networks, are making Malaysia their hub from which to embrace the myriad business 14LeadersThe EconomistDecember23rd201712notoutofnecessity, butoutofa wantofvision orunderstand-ingofwhatAmerica standsto gain from global leadership.The NSSismuch lessradical than MrTrump’scampaignspeeches, with theirtalkofstartingtrade wars, scorn forNATO’sobsolescence and praise forthe meritsoftorture. Itneverthelessmanagesto channel the pessimism ofthat long-ago Manhattan businessman. Itscoﬀsthatfortwo decadesAmerican leadersassumed “engagementwith rivalsand theirinclusion in international institutionsand global commercewould turn them into benign actorsand trustworthypartners.Forthe mostpart, thispremise turned outto be false.”Accordingly, itdrawsstern conclusionsabouthowto han-dle China and Russia. MrTrump ishardlythe ﬁrstAmericanpresidentto grumble aboutChinese trade practicesor Russianadventurism. Indeed, hawkswill see much to like in sectionsoftheNSSthatchide Russia forbullyingitsneighbours ormed-dlingin democraticelections, a charge MrTrump himself isoddlyunwillingto level. Domesticand foreign politicianswith conventional viewswill also be relieved to see the NSSdescribe America asa force forgood in the world—a powerthatstill seesa place for(reformed) bodieslike the UN.However, a pessimisticstrand also runsthrough this Trum-pian NSS.

Lifts have shaped 
modern cities; with new
technology they could 
refashion them again

R O T TW E I L A N D T Y T Y R I

T HE Finnish lift’s walls are bathed by a blue luminescence;
music that is not quite jazz gently tootles within. The eﬀect is
comforting. But other things are odd. The lift’s dozen or so
buttons seem numbered at random and, one would think, unfea-
sibly: 45, 105, 215, 270. At level 350 the doors hiss open on a dark and
dirty cavern, silent save for the sound of dripping water. 
Germany’s highest meeting room, 1,000km (600 miles) to the
south-west of that strange Finnish lift, has its oddities, too. It looks
out not at a central business district, but on the bucolic edge of the
Black Forest. It sits atop a skyscraper which contains no oﬃces but
12 lift shafts. In the lift by which you reach the penthouse an indi-
cator tells you not just what ﬂoor you are headed for, but how fast
you are getting there. 
Thyssenkrupp, a German engineering conglomer-
ate, and Kone, a Finnish liftmaker, are two of the
world’s big four lift-engineering companies. As such,
they need places to test new designs, new patterns of
operation and new technologies. Kone does this in a
mineshaft in Tytyri, about 50km west of Helsinki; if
you take that glowing blue lift down to the dank cav-
ern at level 350—so called because it is 350 metres (1,150
feet) below the top of an adjacent shaft—and go
through a steel door you will ﬁnd yourself in the work-

ous notions of

ing mine which that other shaft serves. 
Thyssenkrupp’s facility is more ﬂashy; a slim, 246-
metre-high concrete ﬁnger clad in an elegant barley-
sugar twist of fabric. Inaugurated in October, it towers
above the medieval town of Rottweil, hitherto best
known for its beefy guard dogs. The town welcomed it
with a two-day celebration; the view from the top—on
a clear day you can see to the Alps—is expected to bring
in an additional 50,000 tourists a year.
The technology being improved in these out-of-
the-way places is essential to modern city life. Around
1bn people take one of the world’s 14m lifts every day;
they take twice as many lift journeys in a day as people
take ﬂights in a year. Cities struggle on through bus and
rail strikes; life without lifts, at least in central business
districts, would more or less grind to a halt.
The lift is to the vertical what the car is to the hori-
zontal: the deﬁning means of transport. Like cars, mod-
ern lifts are creatures of the second industrial revolu-
tion of the late 19th century. Like cars, they have
transformed the way that cities look, changing how
and where people live and work. And today, like the
cars that are lidar-sensing their way towards an auton-

omous future, lifts stand ready to change the city again. 
Hoisting equipment of one sort or another has been in use for
millennia. The Colosseum in Rome had 24 lifts powered by slaves.
For centuries arrangements of pulleys and ropes were used in
mines, factories and even occasionally to move people in palaces
and private homes. Erhard Weigel, a 17th-century German math-
ematician, used a system of pulleys to transport himself around
his seven-storey home in Jena. Louis XV installed a counterweight
lift to his private chambers in Versailles in 1743.

The commanding heights
The modern lift was introduced to the public at New York’s Exhibi-
tion of the Industry of All Nations in May 1854 by Elisha Otis,
whose name still adorns more elevators than any other. His pat-
ented innovation added to the basic box, rope and counterweight
a spring-loaded ratchet which would stop the lift falling if the
main cable snapped. In front of a large audience he ascended to a
height of 15 metres before an assistant with an axe severed the ca-
ble. “All safe, gentlemen. All safe” he is said to have proclaimed
after the safety catch tripped. He installed his ﬁrst passenger lift in
E.V. Haughwout and Company, a porcelain shop, three years later.
It was not a success. Customers would not ride in the fearful
new device, and Haughwout got rid of it in 1860. Otis’s eventual
triumph had to wait for two other innovations: steel-frame con-
struction, which allowed buildings to be taller, and electric mo-
tors, which allowed lifts to be faster. 
Before the 1880s buildings had to support the load imposed by
their upper ﬂoors with the walls of their lower ones. The taller the
building, the thicker the lowest walls—and thus the less ground-
ﬂoor space there was to rent. More than a dozen storeys was im-
practical. 
Even at 12 storeys a lift comes in handy, and big new buildings
in America started to boast them (in 1870 New York’s Equitable
Life building became the ﬁrst oﬃce to do so). But for the most part
they used hydraulic lifts which pushed passengers up from below.
These required a piston sunk down into the ground to a depth
matching the height of the liftshaft—inconvenient, but not impos-
sible for something under 20 storeys. And they were a lot faster
than Otis’s steam-driven counterweight lifts. 
The electric motor changed that. Otis’s original steam-pow-
ered lift climbed at 0.2 meters per second (m/s). The electriﬁed lifts
in the ﬁrst steel-framed building to top 50 ﬂoors, the 241-metre
Woolworth Building, which opened in 1913, were more than ten
times faster. Two decades later those in the 381-metre Empire State
Building travelled at 6m/s, as fast as many modern lifts. 
By this stage, America’s cities looked like nothing the world
had ever seen before. Before the lift, buildings of more than six sto-
reys were rare; roofscapes were low and even, broken occasional-
ly by the bulk of citadels and places of worship. There are few such
cityscapes left today. Paris has mostly succeeded in keeping its
rooﬂine even (despite a towering icon that depends on cunningly
non-vertical lift technology). Kone’s 16th-ﬂoor boardroom, ironi-
cally, overlooks a Helsinki kept deﬁantly low-rise by strict plan-
ning laws. But most cities reach for the sky, sometimes dramatical-
ly—Dubai—sometimes in a higgle-piggle—São Paulo. 
In extending the human world upwards, the lift overturned
previous notions of prestige. Before the 20th century people
prized proximity to the pavement. The ﬁrst ﬂoor, above the hub-
bub of the street but conveniently accessed by a single ﬂight of
stairs, was the ﬂoor most sought after—the piano nobile or bel étage.
Anything above the second ﬂoor was typically reserved for ser-
vants. In hotels and tenements, standards and prices fell with alti-
tude. As Andreas Bernard points out in “Lifted: A Cultural History
of the Elevator”, top ﬂoors were considered a public-health risk.
The strain of tackling so many stairs, the diﬃculty of getting out-
side in the fresh air and the trapped heat of summer played a part
in this. It may be no coincidence that the garrett was home to con-
sumptive artists. 

The lift not only made much higher ﬂoors possible,
it gave them a new status and glamour. Rents began to
rise, not fall, with height. The penthouse—a word that
took its modern meaning in the 1920s—became a status
symbol. From the Equitable Life Building onwards, top
executives took to the top ﬂoors. Altitude was emi-
nence, farsightedness, elevation—power. 
Lifts also made the workplace more regular. Struc-
tures built around staircases had internal arrange-
ments much less strict than today’s, with mezzanines
and back-stairs that provided diﬀerent points of access
to the same ﬂoor. Lifts imposed a new simplicity. The
lobby where lifts arrive and depart serves as a focus on
each ﬂoor. Storeys are strictly and consistently set
apart by number (with the occasional exception for
triskaidekaphobes and their equivalents in other cul-
tures). This repetitive stacking of space, some have ar-
gued, played a crucial role in formalising oﬃce plans
and hierarchies. There is a reason why M.C. Escher
never etched any delightfully paradoxical lift shafts.
By the 1970s lift engineering was a pretty mature in-
dustry, and started to consolidate and globalise. Kone
and Thyssenkrupp, along with the Swiss ﬁrm Schin-
dler, bought up rival ﬁrms to join Otis (now a division
of United Technologies) as worldwide brands. Be-
tween them the big four now account for around two-
thirds of the global market; Hitachi and Mitsubishi of
Japan take quite a lot of the rest. There is as yet no Chi-
nese lift giant—perhaps because the industry relies as
much on its ability to provide services on a global scale
as on its mechanical engineering prowess. Half the big
four’s annual revenues of $40bn (€36bn) come from
that side of the business. 
But if China is not a force in the industry, it has been
a huge inﬂuence on it; the Chinese appetite for more,
higher and faster lifts is like nothing seen since 1920s
New York. In 2000 some 40,000 new lifts were in-
stalled in the country. By 2016 the number was

1

579m

600,000—almost three quarters of the 825,000 sold worldwide.
China not only wanted more skyscrapers; it wanted taller ones.
More than 100 buildings round the world are over 300 metres; al-
most all of them were built this century, and nearly half of them in
China. The country is home to two-thirds of the 128 buildings over
200 metres completed in 2016. Other countries may content them-
selves with a few show-oﬀ pinnacles. China buys them by the
dozen.
Such buildings exacerbate the constraints liftmakers and the
architects they work with have always faced: time and space.
Kheir Al-Kodmany at the University of Illinois has found that after
28 seconds waiting, would-be passengers start to get irritated. And
while lifts make rentable ﬂoor space reachable, they attract no rent
themselves. At the top of the tallest buildings (which are often ta-
pered, both because of the wind and to reduce loading on the
structure below) the lift shafts may take up 40% of the ﬂoor space.
The fewer the shafts, the more lucrative the building.
Increasing speed, a focus of the Japanese lift manufacturers,
saves some time. Lifts typically travel at around 8-9m/s. Mitsub-
ishi’s lifts in the Shanghai Tower more than double
that, reaching 20m/s (45 miles per hour). But though
the users value speed, they have problems with the ac-
celeration that provides it. Lifts accelerate at less than a
tenth of the rate of an average car, because being
pushed into the ﬂoor of a lift is a lot less comfortable
than being pushed back in your seat. This means lifts
can only reach their top speed on long uninterrupted
runs. And even then, only on the upward leg; people
are yet more sensitive to acceleration going down. De-
signers could get their lifts up to 20m/s just by letting
them fall free for two seconds; but most customers
wouldn’t thank them for it. 
Henrik Ehrnrooth, the boss of Kone, thinks the
quest for further speed is now pretty much played out.
The time it takes for the doors to open and close, he
says, has as big an inﬂuence on the total time it takes to
get to your desk—the measure which matters most.
Kone, and the rest of the big four, concentrate more on
the hardware and algorithms needed to prevent un-
necessary stopping and empty journeys, which cuts
waiting times and reduces the number of shafts need-
ed for a given building. 
Liftmakers say that “Destination control”, in which
the lift system tells the user which lift to use, rather
than the user telling the lift where to go, reduces door-
to-desk time by 30%. Pair it with double-decker lifts,
which in very tall buildings usefully serve odd and
even ﬂoors simultaneously, and you increase capacity
even further. (Such lifts are also spectacular, at least
they are if you are in the perspex-walled observation
level halfway down one of Kone’s mineshaft testbeds
watching them rush past like lorries.) 
Alternatively, separate the top and the bottom deck
and have two independent lifts in the same shaft. This
allows an express lift serving a “sky lobby” on the 25th
ﬂoor to run in the same shaft as the lift that oﬀers a
stopping service to the ﬂoors above. At least one com-
pany has attempted to put three lifts in a single shaft,
but the challenges have so far proved insurmountable.
Really tall buildings pose problems of their own.
Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world,
has 163 ﬂoors and measures 830m to its tip. But to get to
the top you must change at a sky lobby; the longest
ride oﬀered by any of its 57 lifts is just 504 metres. The
limiting factor is the steel lift cable. Any longer and it
gets so heavy that it might snap under it own weight.
UltraRope, developed by Kone, gets around this
problem by using carbon ﬁbre. When the Jeddah Tow-

er in Saudi Arabia, the world’s ﬁrst 1km building,
opens in 2020 it will boast a 660-metre lift made pos-
sible by UltraRope; the company thinks doing a whole
kilometre should be feasible, if anyone wants to. 
UltraRope has other advantages. Tall buildings
sway with the wind, an eﬀect that Thyssen Krup’s test
tower replicates with 240 jiggle-able tonnes of con-
crete on the 21st ﬂoor. Steel ampliﬁes the swing like a
strummed guitar string, which can damage the shafts
and the cables. UltraRope has a higher resonant fre-
quency, making it less sensitive to such sway

The power of lateral thinking
A development being tested at Rottweil goes even fur-
ther—doing away with the cable altogether. Thyssen-
krupp, which also makes railway equipment, has har-
nessed high-speed rail technology to create Multi, a
system held in place and accelerated by electromag-
netic forces like those used for magnetic-levitation
trains. This is not a new idea. One of the ﬁrst people to
look into it was a PhD student in Manchester in the
1970s, Haider al-Abadi, who is now prime minister of
Iraq. But now it seems as if its time may have come.
By eliminating the cable, Multi aims to take away
all limits on height other than those imposed by a
building’s structure. The absence of cables will also al-
low lifts to move laterally, as well as vertically, making
the whole system more like a railway. Lift shafts will be
able to fork and rejoin to allow overtaking; descending
lifts could sidestep ascending ones. 
The ﬁrst building to commission such lifts, Berlin’s
East Side Tower, will not be able to use Multi until it
has been certiﬁed by the authorities, probably around
2020. Nor can it make full use of the system’s potential;
while Multi could have served its needs with just six
shafts, the emergency services, less trusting of the new
technology, have demanded two additional old-fash-
ioned lifts so they can reach the upper ﬂoors if some-
thing goes wrong.
Further oﬀ, though, the possibilities have lift buﬀs
giddy with excitement. Adrian Godwin, a consultant
who has advised on some of the world’s tallest build-
ings, imagines systems like Multi making buildings of
250 storeys or more possible, with many more lift cab-
ins circulating in cores smaller than those in use today.
The number of cars in the system could be changed on
the ﬂy to reﬂect usage patterns, which will make things
more energy-eﬃcient. 
Buildings could change shape, as well as size. Mr
Godwin, along with Thomas Heatherwick, a noted
British designer, has envisaged an oﬃce block that
curves up elegantly from a large base using revolving
lift cabins like those on a Ferris wheel. He also has a vi-
sion for a building shaped like a giant hoop; lifts freed
from cables require no central core.
Perhaps most intriguing, new types of sideways-
scooting lifts could link up whole clusters of buildings.
Transport hubs could house lifts serving a range of lo-
cal buildings, moving ﬁrst horizontally, then vertically.
Or the lifts could zip between their tops on skybridges.
It took trees hundreds of million of years to evolve the
structural systems and internal plumbing needed for
wide-spreading boughs, thus making possible the
wonderfully rich ecosystems of rainforest canopies.
Lateral lifts could make canopy cities possible before
Otis’s patent sees its bicentenary. Having let cities
climb into the sky, the lift may now help them spread
across it. *

The perils of
polygamy

How plural marriage begets violence

C A I R O , L A H O R E A N D W A U

I T IS a truth universally acknowledged,
or at least widely accepted in South Su-
dan, that a man in possession of a good
fortune must be in want of many wives.
Paul Malong, South Sudan’s former army
chief of staﬀ, has more than 100—no one
knows the exact number. A news website
put it at 112 in February, after one of the
youngest of them ran oﬀ to marry a teach-
er. The couple were said to be in hiding. To
adapt Jane Austen again, we are all fools in
love, but especially so if we cuckold a war-
lord in one of the world’s most violent
countries.
Men in South Sudan typically marry as
often as their wealth—often measured in
cattle—will allow. Perhaps 40% of mar-
riages are polygamous. “In [our] culture,
the more family you have, the more people
respect you,” says William, a young IT spe-
cialist in search of his second wife (his
name, like some others in this article, has
been changed). Having studied in America
and come back to his home village, he
ﬁnds that he is wealthy by local standards.
So why be content with just one bride?
Few South Sudanese see the connec-
tion between these matrimonial customs
and the country’s horriﬁc civil war. If you
ask them the reason for the violence, locals
will blame tribalism, greedy politicians,
weak institutions and perhaps the oil
wealth which gives warlords something to
ﬁght over. All true, but not the whole story.
Wherever it is widely practised, polyga-
my (speciﬁcally polygyny, the taking of
multiple wives) destabilises society, large-
ly because it is a form of inequality which
creates an urgent distress in the hearts, and
loins, of young men. If a rich man has a
Lamborghini, that does not mean that a
poor man has to walk, for the supply of
cars is not ﬁxed. By contrast, every time a
rich man takes an extra wife, another poor
man must remain single. If the richest and
most powerful 10% of men have, say, four
wives each, the bottom 30% of men cannot
marry. Young men will take desperate measures to avoid this state.
This is one of the reasons why the Arab Spring erupted, why
the jihadists of Boko Haram and Islamic State were able to con-
quer swathes of Nigeria, Iraq and Syria, and why the polygamous
parts of Indonesia and Haiti are so turbulent. Polygamous societ-
ies are bloodier, more likely to invade their neighbours and more
prone to collapse than others are. The taking of multiple wives is a
feature of life in all of the 20 most unstable countries on the Fragile
States Index compiled by the Fund for Peace, an NGO (see chart on
next page). 
Because polygamy is illegal in most rich countries, many West-
erners underestimate how common it is. More than a third of
women in West Africa are married to a man who has more than
one wife. Plural marriages are plentiful in the Arab world, and fair-

ly common in South-East Asia and a few parts of the
Caribbean. The cultures involved are usually patrilin-
eal: ie, the family is deﬁned by the male bloodline. And
they are patrilocal: wives join the husband’s family
and leave their own behind. Marriages are often
sealed by the payment of a brideprice from the
groom’s family to the bride’s. This is supposed to com-
pensate the bride’s family for the cost of raising her. 
A few men attract multiple wives by being excep-
tionally charismatic, or by persuading others that they
are holy. “There may be examples of [male] cult lead-
ers who did not make use of their position to further
their personal polygyny, but I cannot think of any,”
notes David Barash of the University ofWashington in

“Out of Eden: The Surprising Consequences of Polyga-
my”. However, the most important enabler of the
practice is not the unequal distribution of charm but
the unequal distribution of wealth. Brideprice societ-
ies where wealth is unevenly distributed lend them-
selves to polygamy—which in turn inﬂates the price of
brides, often to ruinous heights. In wretchedly poor
Afghanistan, the cost of a wedding for a young man
averages $12,000-$20,000.
By increasing the bride price, polygamy tends to
raise the age at which young men get married; it takes
a long time to save enough money. At the same time, it
lowers the age at which women get married. All but
the wealthiest families need to “sell” their daughters
before they can aﬀord to “buy” wives for their sons;
they also want the wives they shell out for to be young
and fertile. In South Sudan “a girl is called an old lady
at age 20 because she cannot bear many children after
that,” a local man told Marc Sommers of Boston Uni-
versity and Stephanie Schwartz of Columbia Univer-
sity. A tribal elder spelled out the maths of the situa-
tion. “When you have 10 daughters, each one will give
you 30 cows, and they are all for [the father]. So then
you have 300 cows.” If a patriarch sells his daughters
at 15 and does not let his sons marry until they are 30,
he has 15 years to enjoy the returns on the assets he
gained from brideprice. That’s a lot of milk. 
Valerie Hudson of Texas A&M University and Hil-
ary Matfess of Yale have found that an inﬂated bride-
price is a “critical” factor “predisposing young men to
become involved in organised group violence for political pur-
poses”. Terrorist groups know this, too. Muhammad Kasab, a Paki-
stani terrorist hanged for his role in the Mumbai attacks of 2008,
said he joined Lashkar-e-Taiba, the jihadist aggressor, because it
promised to pay for his siblings to get married. In Nigeria, Boko
Haram arranges marriages for its recruits. The so-called Islamic
State used to oﬀer foreign recruits $1,500 towards a starter home
and a free honeymoon in Raqqa. Radical Islamist groups in Egypt
have also organised cheap marriages for members. It is not just in
the next life that jihadists are promised virgins.

The deepest deprivation
In South Sudan, brideprices may be anything from 30 to 300 cows.
“For young men, the acquisition of so many cattle through legiti-
mate means is nearly impossible,” write Ms Hudson and Ms Mat-
fess. The alternative is to steal a herd from the tribe next door. In a
country awash with arms, such cattle raids are as bloody as they
are frequent. “7 killed, 10 others wounded in cattle raid in Eastern
Lakes,” reads a typical headline in This Day, a South Sudanese pa-
per. The article describes how “armed youths from neighbouring
communities” stole 58 cows, leaving seven people—and 38 cows—
shot dead “in tragic crossﬁre”.
Thousands of South Sudanese are killed in cattle raids every
year. “When you have cows, the ﬁrst thing you must do is get a
gun. If you don’t have a gun, people will take your cows,” says Jok,
a 30-year-old cattle herder in Wau, a South Sudanese city. He is
only carrying a machete, but he says his brothers have guns. 
Jok loves cows. “They give you milk, and you can marry with
them,” he smiles. He says he will get married this year, though he
does not yet have enough cows and, judging by his ragged clothes,
he does not have the money to buy them, either. He is vague as to
how he will acquire the necessary ruminants. But one can’t help
noticing that he is grazing his herd on land that has recently been
ethnically cleansed. Dinkas like Jok walk around freely in Wau.
Members of other tribes who used to live in the area huddle in
camps for displaced people, guarded by UN peacekeepers. 
The people in the camps all tell similar stories. The Dinkas
came, dressed in blue, and attacked their homes, killing the men

and stealing whatever they could carry away, includ-
ing livestock and young women. “Many of my family
were killed or raped,” says Saida, a village trader. “The
attackers cut people’s heads oﬀ. All the young men
have gone from our village now. Some have joined the
rebels. Some ﬂed to Sudan.” Saida’s husband escaped
and is now with his other wife in Khartoum, the Suda-
nese capital. Saida is left tending ﬁve children. Asked
why all this is happening, she bursts into tears. 
“If you have a gun, you can get anything you want,”
says Abdullah, a farmer who was driven oﬀ his land so
that Dinka marauders could graze their cattle on it. “If a
man with a gun says ‘I want to marry you’, you can’t
say no,” says Akech, an aid worker. This is why adoles-
cent boys hover on the edge of battles in South Sudan.
When a ﬁghter is killed, they rush over and steal his
weapon so that they can become ﬁghters, too. 
Overall, polygamy is in retreat. However, its sup-
porters are ﬁghting to preserve or even extend it. Two-
ﬁfths of Kazakhstanis want to re-legalise the practice (it
was banned by the Bolsheviks). In 2008 they were
thwarted, at least temporarily, when a female MP
amended a pro-polygamy bill to say that polyandry—
the taking of multiple hubands—would be allowed as
well; Muslim greybeards balked at that. 
In the West polygamy is too rare to be socially des-
tabilising. To some extent this is because it is serialised.
Rich and powerful men regularly swap older wives for
younger ones, thus monopolising the prime reproduc-
tive years of several women. But that allows a few
wives, not a few dozen. The polygamous enclaves in
America run by breakaway Mormon sects are highly
unstable—the old men in charge expel large numbers
of young men for trivial oﬀences so they can marry
lots of young women themselves. Nevertheless, some
American campaigners argue that parallelised polyga-
my should be made legal. If the constitution demands
that gay marriage be allowed (as the Supreme Court
ruled in 2015), then surely it is unconstitutional to dis-
allow plural marriage, they argue. “Group marriage is
the next horizon of social liberalism,” writes Fredrik
deBoer, an academic, in Politico, on the basis that long-
term polyamorous relationships deserve as much le-
gal protection as any others freely entered into. 
Proponents of polygamy oﬀer two main arguments
beyond personal preference. One is that it is blessed in
the Koran, which is true. The other is that it gives wom-
en a better chance of avoiding spinsterhood. Rania Ha-
shem, a pro-polygamy campaigner in Egypt, claims
that there is a shortage of men in her country. (There is
not, but this is a common misconception among po-
lygamists.) If more rich, educated Egyptian men take
multiple wives, she says, this will make it easier for
women to exercise their “right to have a husband”.
Mona Abu Shanab, another Egyptian polygamy advo-
cate, argues that polygamy is a sensible way to assuage
male sexual frustration, a common cause of divorce.
“Women after marriage just disregard their men [and]
focus on their kids. They…always have an excuse for
not engaging in intimate relations; they are always
‘tired’ or ‘sick’. This makes the men uncomfortable and
drives them to…have a girlfriend.” 
Some men see polygamy as a pragmatic response
to female infertility. “My ﬁrst wife was issueless,” says
Gurmeet, a 65-year-old landlord in Lahore, Pakistan. At
one point “she said our inability to have a child was
because of my medical condition, not hers. I was en-
raged. I turned to religion and was guided [by God] to

[my] foremost duty to deliver justice.” One
of his wives enters the room and oﬀers to
give her side of the story. Her husband
banishes her, with visible irritation, before
your correspondent can ask her anything. 
Although women in a polygamous
society ﬁnd it relatively easy to get mar-
ried, the quality of their marriages may
not be high. Because such brides are often
much younger, not to mention ill-educat-
ed, they ﬁnd it hard to stand up to their
husbands. And brideprice is not condu-
cive to a relationship of equals. 
In South Sudan, nearly 80% of people
think it acceptable for a husband to beat
his wife for such things as refusing sex,
burning the dinner and so on. Divorce re-
quires that the bride’s family repay the bri-
deprice; they may thus insist that the
abused woman stays with her husband
no matter how badly he treats her. 
Polygamy is also bad for children. A
study of 240,000 children in 29 African
countries found that, after controlling for
other factors, those in polygamous fam-
ilies were more likely to die young. A
study among the Dogon of Mali found that
a child in a polygynous family was seven
to 11 times more likely to die early than a
child in a monogamous one. The father
spends his time siring more children rath-
er than looking after the ones he already
has, Mr Barash explains. Also, according to
the Dogon themselves, jealous co-wives
sometimes poison each other’s oﬀspring
so that their own will inherit more. 
For Akech, the South Sudanese aid
worker, growing up in a polygamous fam-
ily “wasn’t easy”. Her father, a former rebel
commander, had eight wives and numer-
ous concubines. She has 41 siblings that she knows of.
When she was six, she used to fetch 20 litres of water
each day for her mother to use to make siko, a form of
moonshine. Sometimes her father would come round
drunk, bang on the door and take her mother’s money
to spend on another woman. Akech remembers her
parents quarrelling a lot. That said, the extended fam-
ily could pull together in an emergency. When her fa-
ther was shot in the leg, his wives teamed up to bathe
him, get him to hospital and pay his medical bills. 
One day, when Akech was at university, her father
asked her to come and see him. “We had never had a
father-daughter bond, so I was excited,” she remem-
bers. When she arrived, he introduced her to a fellow
oﬃcer and ordered her to marry him. She was horri-
ﬁed. Her father’s friend was 65. Akech was 19. 
She pretended to accept the proposal and said she
just wanted to pop back to her college, which was in a
neighbouring country, to collect her things. Her father
agreed. She went back to college and stayed there. 
That was more than a decade ago. Akech went on
to complete university and ﬁnd a good job. She recent-
ly bought her now-elderly father a house, partly to
show him the value of her education, but also out of a
residual sense of guilt at having once deﬁed him. “In
my culture, your parents are your earthly gods. I tried
not to disappoint him,” she says. He has never said sor-
ry for attempting to sell her. *

2 take a second wife.” He had been planning to try in-vitro fertilisa-
tion but God’s advice looked like a sounder investment. Initially,
his ﬁrst wife was “unwilling to share my aﬀections with another
woman”. But as time passed, she accepted the situation, says Gur-
meet. He divided the house into two parts, so his wives could live
separately. He divided his time equally between them. “It
worked,” he says. The second wife had six children. But Gurmeet
grumbles that she dressed less elegantly than his childless wife
and did not keep her rooms as tidy. 
Polygyny is hard work for men but good for women, says Gur-
meet, because it is “undesirable” for a woman to be unmarried.
Asked about polyandry, Gurmeet says, “I strongly disapprove. It is
against nature for a woman to have multiple partners.” He elabo-
rates: “As a young man I kept chickens. The cock has many hens,
but he does not allow the females to mate with more than one
partner. So it’s against natural law.”

Bad for brides
Polygamy “can work ﬁne, provided you do justice to [all wives]
equally,” says Amar, a Pakistani judge with two wives. “If you do
not prefer any one over the others, no problem arises.” He admits
that if two wives live together in the same home, “a natural rival-
ry” arises. Dividing property can also be complicated and leads to
a lot of litigation. 
But Amar thinks he gets it right. “My routine is: I spend one
night with one wife and one night with the other. That way, no-
body feels treated badly. And I give them exactly the same amount
of money to spend: they get one credit card each. As a judge, it is

Observations from
a suburban railway

F R O M S A I N T - R E M Y - L E S - C H E V R E U S E T O A E R O P O R T C H A R L E S D E G A U L L E

ON SUNNY weekends Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse bustles
with visitors. They admire its goats and cows, buy fresh
farm eggs, picnic in riverside meadows and explore the
11th-century hilltop castle. Furtive mushroom-pickers slip to secret
spots in the woods nearby.
Parisians have been enjoying this fantasy of rural life since the
railway ﬁrst arrived in St-Rémy 150 years ago. The line was dubbed
the “lilac train” in honour of the mauve bouquets taken back to the
Smoke as remembrances of day-trip idylls.
The lilac line is now, rather less charmingly, line B of the region-
al express network (RER, in French). On maps it appears as a blue
thread with frayed ends stretching diagonally across Paris from
bottom left (St-Rémy) to top right. It links country, leafy suburbs,
the opulent city, tourist delights (and traps) and grotty northern
banlieues. At its far end is Charles de Gaulle airport, a sprawling
avant-garde mess that touched down on the ﬁelds of sugar beet
and tulips next to the village of Roissy in 1974.
Despite its name, the B is no express. Tracing its 80km (50 miles)
takes an hour-and-a-half—not that anyone normally does so. Day-
trippers go out; commuters come in; people travel a few stops for
shopping, or to see friends, or to go to school; at airports (the line
indirectly serves one at Orly, as well as Charles de Gaulle) and rail-
way interchanges travellers from further aﬁeld pile on. For all of
them, the line is a means, not an end—and not a particularly ap-
pealing one. Many of the carriages that between them provide al-
most a million journeys a day wobble disturbingly along, with
yellow-painted walls, dim lights, metal coat-hooks over thread-
bare purple seats, a crackling tannoy, doors that hiss, brakes that
squawk like gangs of novice clarinettists. Strikes or breakdowns,
both frequent, bring enormous disruption.
Approach the line as an end-to-end experience, though, rather
than a sometimes irritating bit of infrastructure separating the A
you are at from the B you desire, and things become more fascinat-
ing. François Maspero, a leftist writer, and Anaïk Frantz, a photog-
rapher, celebrated this when they spent a month on the RER B in
1989. Their aim was to show warm, welcoming human life in the

poorest suburbs and defy those who imagined a “cir-
cular purgatory, with Paris as paradise in the middle”.
Their journey told them something about Paris—but
also something universal. 
The railway lines that rush, or chug, into the
world’s cities all give you that universal: the constant
intermingling, and disentangling, of rich and poor, lo-
cal and visitor, native and migrant, young and old; the
enriching diversity and grating inequality. But each
line also gives you something speciﬁc to each particu-
lar string of places, be it the A train in New York, run-
ning from JFK airport up to Harlem, the Yellow Line
that runs through Delhi’s wealthy centre and crowded
slums on to its enormous, sprawling suburbs, or Lon-
don’s District Line, which runs from bankerly Rich-
mond to working-class, immigrant-heavy East Ham.
For the particulars of Paris, take the B train.

RERing to go
Well before dawn on a weekday morning a ﬁngernail
moon hangs over St-Rémy. Birds have their voices, but
little else stirs. The windows of Le Chalet Caﬀe, a bistro
and tobacconist, are dark. At neighbouring La Giostra,
where last night women in tweed jackets ate smoked-
salmon pizza, the doors are blocked by overﬂowing
bins. Only the station is bright, its four faux-Victorian
lamps ablaze, white ﬂoodlights criss-crossing the plat-
form with shadows.
“Yes, yes, don’t worry yourself,” the driver says
amiably as he walks to the cab. “The only direction is
Paris”. A mother waves oﬀ her shaven-headed son, a
military-camouﬂage pack on his back. A middle-aged
woman scowls at a pair of guide books for Dubai.
Once oﬀ, the bright line of wagons creeps between
stations barely a minute apart. The ﬁrst passengers—
ruddy-faced, well-to-do, lugging suitcases—appear to

be poised for travel, not commuting. They are almost silent. Those
who get on respect a universal rule of public transport in the West,
sitting as far as possible from their fellows (they avoid eye contact,
too). The line loops past a ruined farmhouse. There were vine-
yards down here, before phylloxera struck.
At Bures-sur-Yvette, as darkness begins to lift, potted geraniums
cram windowsills and the 19th-century villas boast turrets. Haydn
and Mozart will be performed next Saturday in Saint Matthieu’s
church, which predates them both by centuries. A white-haired
man in a linen jacket, baguette in his wicker basket, heads into the
“artisanal” butchers. Take coﬀee and a croissant at the bistro—the
owner proposes traditional “tartiﬂette” for lunch—and nothing
seems to have changed for decades. A few Portuguese-speakers in
hard hats stand at the aluminium bar; the rest of the clientele is
pale-skinned. The village memorial counts 67 villagers lost in two
world wars.
As dawn gives way to daylight the train slips under a 19th-cen-
tury aqueduct on millstone pillars, built in the place of a Roman
predecessor, and enters the suburbs proper. Station walls are
draped in purple ivy. Orange-red tiles top many homes. Posters
promote exhibitions in Paris. Near Sceaux the tree-lined avenues
remain, as they have been for more than a century, a home for
writers, academics, musicians (as well as disturbingly well-coif-
fured dogs). When Erik Satie died in Arcueil, his bedroom was said
to contain 100 umbrellas and an untouched piano.
This is a well-heeled world for the cultured and comfortably
liberal. Its voters ﬂocked to the young centrist Emmanuel Macron
in last spring’s elections. Not all is genteel. You can walk by large
housing estates in the southern banlieues, just as in the north. But
they are for the most part well tended, fenced oﬀ, freshly painted.
Once in a rare while the graﬃti, ubiquitous along the line, is actu-
ally uplifting. At a station beside a stately school, a wall enjoins
travellers to “hope, hope”; the words are English, the lower-case
letters in the looping, cursive hand that French children must still
perfect. It is a diﬀerent story north on the line. Fresh graﬃti in the
station at La Courneuve says “A bas Le Macronisme” (Down with
Macronism). Up there, the voters turned to hard-left politicians,
such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Up there, food outlets oﬀer fried
chicken, not tartiﬂette.
As suburb becomes city in the south, most passengers are clear-
ly on their way to work. The train breathes in tieless young men in
dark suits watching Les Simpson on their phones; middle-aged
ones playing Candy Crush. A man in a black T-shirt studies a slen-
der book on quantum gravity; perhaps he is from the nuclear-re-
search centre at Saclay. 
For some, the train itself is a workplace. A silent woman in a
leopard-print headscarf hands out yellow cards describing four
jobless brothers. The pale blue card of a pot-bellied man reports
he has no employment and wishes you safe travels. The beggar in
the dark blue cap is readiest to smile.

Brass bands play and feet start to pound
The line only reached the heart of Paris in 1895, when a tunnel was
built from Denfert to Luxembourg station. It took a further eight
decades for it to be coaxed under the River Seine (down an espe-
cially steep incline) and connected with the north. 
At the trio of underground stations—Port-Royal, Luxembourg,
Saint-Michel-Notre-Dame—which constitutes the heart of tourist-
Paris, couples with small backpacks ﬂood the train. They are insis-
tently warned by loudspeaker, in several languages, of the dan-
gers of pickpockets. With the carriages too packed to pass through,
begging moves to the platforms and corridors. In the monstrous
maze of Châtelet Les Halles—120 trains an hour, and allegedly the
largest metro station in the world—women in black and children
in bright coats pass entire days sitting underground on tiled ﬂoors.
One woman explains her home was in Aleppo. 
There are buskers, too. The regional rail operator, RATP, says
there are 300 or so oﬃcially accredited ones. Antoine Naso, a

stocky former line manager, calls the city’s 5.5m Metro
passengers “one of the biggest music scenes in the
world”; he recently put on a concert of some of the
best acts of the past two decades. Every few months
Mr Naso auditions new talent in a tiny basement
mock-up of a metro tunnel. Two choral singers in sen-
sible dresses perform Henry Purcell’s “Let us wander”.
Endless young men with beards cover rock and pop
anthems. The stand-out is Podkopaev Evguenio Ko-
rela, once a Finnish hard-rocker, who has by some
technical magic transformed the lime-green handle of
a broom into a funky percussive synthesiser. He has
played in the city for 30 years; he talks movingly of his
love for the “liberalism [and] democracy of Paris”.
Mr Korela won’t perform on the B train. It is too
noisy. He and bigger bands like Eurofolk, an eight-piece
Ukrainian gypsy-jazz group with quite a following,
prefer the acoustics and space of stations like Châtelet
Les Halles; the echoes of Eurofolk’s set can be heard
from the RER platform. But Wayne Standley, a mid-
western folk guitarist, says he has played the length of
the B line. The southern part “got lonesome towards
the end,” he recalls, “but you needed a rest. And it was
quieter, so you could sound a little better”. He remem-
bers a Malaysian guitarist friend who thrived on the B
train with a set consisting mostly of advertising jingles.

North of Gare du Nord, the line threads between massive resi-
dential blocks and post-industrial districts, some buzzing, some
distinctly not. As the steelworks, glyceride reﬁneries, car plants
and warehouses up here have closed, they have been replaced by
studios for ﬁlm editors and artists, glass oﬃce towers, shopping
malls and recycling plants. The beggars return to the carriages—
but up here they are mostly white, and addicts. A grinning woman
in a black baseball cap moves quickly along on her crutches, a car-
riage per stop; she oﬀers no story, just asks for money. 
Life here is far tougher than in the centre or south. In 2010 Em-
manuel Vigneron, a geographer, compared death rates, medical
care and incomes of people near every station on the RER B, adapt-
ing a technique ﬁrst used to study health-care diﬀerences along
the belt road of Tahiti. “We showed that by moving 15 minutes out
of Paris mortality rates would double”, he says. In a sample of
women from Port-Royal, in central Paris, and La Plaine-Stade de
France, where the average income is dramatically lower, he found
that those few stops further north represented an 82% higher risk
of dying in a given year. Similar studies for commuter lines else-
where have since become a headline-friendly way for various cit-
ies to worry about their inequality. 
The presiding spirit of the banlieues is Paul Delouvrier, an ad-
ministrator ordered by Charles de Gaulle to sort the “shambles” of
the outer city and its slums. His legacy is one of huge, dispiriting
tower blocks—the main focus of the book Maspero and Ms Frantz
produced in 1989. For all their work’s sympathetic, humane
charm, though, the decades since have mostly strengthened a
popular view of northern banlieues as alien and threatening, a
home to Islamist and immigrant extremists, sites of police brutal-
ity, riots, drug-dealing and rape. In February 2017 riots raged for
several nights in estates near the RER station at Aulnay-sous-Bois
after police reportedly sodomised a young man with a baton. 
Take an afternoon walk around estates such as La Courneuve
4000 or Aulnay 3000, where thousands of people are packed
tightly together, and it is no wonder that many told Maspero that
their dream was to move to a pavillon, one of the modest, privately
owned villas that predated the projects. A massive wall of apart-
ments has a broken plastic symbol of a galleon on its side. It is said
to be due for demolition soon. By a doorway a woman tends a ﬁre
in a shopping trolley, roasting maize cobs to sell. Men stand on the
roadside with tiny coolboxes, oﬀering single cans of ﬁzzy drink.
Above them is an enormous poster of Moussa Sissoko, a football-
er in the national team who was a resident here from 1989 to 2001.
It is a reminder that some, at least, succeed and leave. 
Get oﬀ at Drancy station and things look more welcoming. But
among the grey, four-storey blocks of La Muette estate, built in the

1930s, there is a wooden cattle wagon, stencilled with a
Star of David on one door as well as lettering of SNCF,
France’s national railway company. Parties of school-
children circle the site with a guide. In the second
world war La Muette, surrounded by barbed wire and
watch-towers, was Paris’s concentration camp for
those of Jewish descent. A memorial centre at the site,
inaugurated by France’s president only in 2012, ex-
plains how mostly French guards oversaw the camp
and the transport of inmates to the border, en route to
Auschwitz. Today, bicycles are scattered on communal
grass in early-evening sunshine.

All passed out of our lives
On the last leg north, the city breathes out. Having sent
its commuters home it has a few hours to relax. Four
teenage boys, sweaty in football kits, noisily debate
their performances on the pitch. Young women run
laughing and cheering into the carriage: one wears an
ankle-length, dazzling white fur coat and sports a bee-
hive of red hair; the head of her friend is shaved in an
intricate criss-cross pattern. 
The line splits at Aulnay. One branch slips under a
motorway and out into ﬁelds of maize. The other takes
a jumble of commuters and travellers towards the air-
port. In a few years, though, the travellers will be gone.
Before the Olympics come to Paris in 2024 a non-stop
service will start whisking passengers from Charles de
Gaulle to Gare de l’Est, in the centre, in just 20 minutes.
The locals will be left alone. 
Monks in saﬀron robes and orange bobble hats
stare out at arenas, hotels, exhibition centres and con-
struction sites, approaching a terminal that is ﬂoodlit
in red, white and blue, a top-heavy mass of concrete
and shadow. Its signs are algebra in blue—2A-G divided
by T3 in this direction, but carry T1 into the shuttle-bus
column. Silvery escalators rise from the platform, their
passengers’ heads tilted upwards—a group of Chinese
tourists, each with a rectangular cardboard train ticket
in hand; those monks, unencumbered by any luggage
at all. It is near midnight as they glide up, and up, into
the artiﬁcial light. Below, the windows of the B train,
etched with graﬃti, are radiant in the gloom. *

Fermenting food

Universe

The Economist December 23rd 2017

Dinner tastes best pre-digested

L I B E R T Y , T E N N E S S E E

SANDOR KATZ’S kitchen is an alchemist’s laboratory. Glass
jars ﬁlled with grains and spices both common and unusu-
al—oat groats and rice, millet and dried tapioca pearls, sugar
and liquorice, dulse and mauby bark—line ceiling-high shelves.
Beneath them sit carboys ﬁlled with homemade meads, fruit
wines and perry. In glass jars and ceramic crocks on the broad cen-
tral table, the alchemist’s assistants—trillions of bacteria—trans-
form red cabbage into crisp sauerkraut with a hint of caraway,
deep green summer cucumbers into ﬁzzingly sour olive-coloured
pickles, carrots and green cabbage into bracing pao cai (Chinese
pickles), and sliced daikon radish into an extraordinary kimchi. Its
powerful funk blooms into the room as soon as Mr Katz removes
the crock top.
Fermentation is the world’s oldest method of storage and pres-
ervation. It arose out of practicality. It is easiest to grow cabbages,
and other crops, if you synchronise the planting and harvesting;
but you cannot eat them all at once. If you shred, salt and pack
those same cabbages in jars they will last more or less indeﬁnitely,
and, in the process, become much tastier.
People tend to think of fermented foods as pickly and sour: that
pao cai, for instance. In fact, bread, cheese, yogurt, chocolate and
tea all undergo some kind of fermentation. Bread depends on it to
make dough rise: yeasts, whether wild or lab-domesticated, con-
sume the simple sugars found in ﬂour. In bread, though, as in choc-

olate, the microbes are dead at the point of consump-
tion. Unpasteurised sauerkraut, kimchi and kombu-
cha, on the other hand, teem with live bacteria.
To biologists, fermentation is the anaerobic meta-
bolising of sugars. It is what the yeast used to make
bread, beer and wine does when it turns carbohy-
drates into alcohol and carbon dioxide without the
beneﬁt of oxygen. But not all the processes in Mr Katz’s
kitchen are anaerobic. Tempeh, a Javanese food made
from soya beans inoculated with spores of Rhizopus, a
parasitic fungus, requires air to circulate if the mould is
to grow into a solid cake around the beans. In his book
“The Art of Fermentation”, Mr Katz (pictured) prefers a
broader deﬁnition: “the transformation of food by va-
rious bacteria, fungi and the enzymes they produce”.
Not all microbial transformations are desirable.
Leave a head of cabbage in brine for a week or a month
and you will have delicious sauerkraut (see our festive
recipe online). Leave it on the kitchen counter for a
month and you will have a slimy mess. But the line be-
tween fermented and rotten is not always so stark.
Sometimes, like beauty, it exists in the beholder’s eye.
With the exception of some Nordic types, Westerners
tend to be repulsed by stinky, fermented ﬁsh. But they

1

2 will happily eat stinky, fermented milk in the form of Gorgonzola
or Stilton. Many East and South-East Asians, who consume ﬁsh
sauce regularly, eschew cheese.
At the moment, though, people’s palates seem to be widening.
Mr Katz teaches fermentation workshops around the world to
strangers who come together to salt and squeeze root vegetables
and trade SCOBYs (a “symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast”—
the broad, slimy, vaguely organ-like disc that turns tea and sugar
into kombucha). Enthusiasts trade sourdough starters and keﬁr
grains (at Bridge Farm in Ambridge, the setting for “The Archers”,
an enduring BBC radio series, they talk of little else). Fermenta-
tion’s popularity seems in part a reaction against the last decade’s
fad for “molecular gastronomy”—using chemistry to transform the
taste and texture of food—and of a piece with other back-to-nature
trends such as foraging and cooking over open ﬁres.

Microbiomial gastronomy
Fermentation produces delicious foods. But more than that, it con-
nects humans to the invisible processes of life all—to the microbes
that were here for billions of years before humans arrived, and
will persist for billions more after they have gone. Fermentation
enlists the microbes’ aid, proceeds on their schedules, succeeds or
fails according to their needs and rules. 
The oneness goes deeper than that. The Buddhist notion of
anatta, or non-selfhood, is biologically true. People are not unitary
beings; they are entire universes for the “microbiomes” that live
on and within them. More than 700 types of microbe live in a typ-
ical person’s mouth. The gut bustles with bacteria by the trillion
which assist with digestion, helping determine health,
weight and even mood. Ferments made by diﬀerent
people can vary because of the diﬀerent microbes
transferred from their makers’ hands. Some pioneers
have tried producing cheese from bacteria found in
their armpits and navels.
Fermentation extends the microbiome in time and
space, allowing its microbial members to start digest-
ing things before they even reach the lips. The micro-
organisms thus pressed into service may be carefully
chosen, and passed down through the generations.
They may be simply introduced through “backslop-
ping”—using a bit of a previous ferment to start the
next batch. Or they may be left to happenstance: lam-
bic beers and some sourdough starters use wild yeasts
naturally present in the air or on bits of organic materi-
al. This entails some risk. A successful sourdough start-
er will smell slightly sour and pleasantly yeasty; one
where the wrong microbes won will smell like vomit
or putrefaction. 
Nearly everyone on Earth consumes some form of fermented
food regularly. In most of the world, this is just the way things have
always been. The current revival of interest in the West is in part
simply a return to the norm; in the 20th century much of Europe
and America descended into peculiar ignorance on the subject.
The decline of fermentation in the West can largely be put
down to the concentration of agriculture. In 1870, agriculture em-
ployed almost half of all American workers; each farmworker
could produce enough to feed just ﬁve others, and people knew a
great deal about how food was stored and prepared. Today only
1.4% of American employees work on farms. This has freed people
from the need to spend hours churning butter from cows they
milked themselves, or manually shredding ﬁelds of cabbage and
turnips to salt for the winter. It has made cheap food abundant
and moved workers into more economically productive jobs. But,
as Mr Katz notes, the move from farmhouse porches and cellars to
factories has rendered once quotidian processes mysterious. 
It has also made food more predictable, and mass production
easier. Commercial yeast acts quickly and ﬂawlessly. Sourdough
starters—slurries of ﬂour and water that attract yeasts and lactic-

Fermentation
extends the

time and space

acid bacteria—take days to create, and produce diﬀer-
ent tastes from place to place. Sourdoughs taste better
than the squishy, shrink-wrapped loaves on grocery-
store shelves, but brands require consistency, and not
everyone wants to bake (or pay for) an artisanal loaf,
however delicious, whenever they want toast. 
Pasteurisation also had a hand in fermentation’s
Western waning. Not all bugs are good bugs, and Louis
Pasteur’s innovation of heating milk and other foods
enough to kill oﬀ bacteria undoubtedly saved many
lives. But it brought with it the idea that all bacteria
were germs to be ruthlessly extirpated, rather than a
workforce to be exploited—or allies to be encouraged. 
Rob Knight, who heads the American Gut Project at
the University of California, San Diego and researches
the links between the microbiome and general health,
says that lactic-acid bacteria do in the sauerkraut crock
or the yogurt pot what they do in the gut: render their
environment unfriendly to an array of unhealthy fun-
gi and bacteria. Mr Knight has found that people who
eat fermented foods tend to have more diverse gut bac-
teria. This, in turn, tends to be associated with better
physical and mental health, though whether a bounti-
fully biodiverse gut is a cause or an eﬀect of better
health remains unclear.
Pasteurised foods, with and without the addition
of acetic acid, do stay fresh longer; that which is not
pasteurised is still, sometimes, unsafe. But fermented
foods thus preserved tend to be more astringent and
less subtle than those that live on in the consumer, and
they have none of their biological diversity.
When it relies on ambient microbes fermentation
is incredibly local; but the natural home for the new
enthusiasm, as for all today’s enthusiasm, is the cos-
mopolitan internet. On Facebook groups bakers can
post pictures of their sourdough breads to collect tips
(“strengthen the gluten by starting with cold autolyse
without starter or salt ﬁrst”) and praise. Kombucha
makers can oﬀer their SCOBYs to willing takers (“If no
one claims in two days, it’s compost”). And brewers
can discuss the ﬁner points of Brettanomyces (a kind of
wild yeast), the implications of brewing with sorghum
and the ﬁnest fashion to keep their foeder in ﬁne fettle.
On Etsy, an e-commerce site selling handmade
crafts, bakers can buy sourdough starters with a story.
One of those sold by Ken Greenlaw, somewhat unap-
petisingly known as “Bavarian Black Death”, claims to
have originated in Oberammergau in 1633; another,
from Egypt, boasts of being “as old as the pyramids”.
Have they been independently, veriﬁably traced back
to their supposed origins? Not exactly: “You take it
with a grain of salt,” says Mr Greenlaw (referring to the
stories, rather than the starters). 
Stories apart, most starters originated in obscurity.
But internet-enabled enthusiasm means few of any
quality will end up there; no promising culture of
helpful microbes need ever be lost again. Eric Rusch
has been selling his starter online for 12 years. “If any-
thing happened to my starter,” he says, sounding like
nothing so much as a proud father, “I could send out an
e-mail to 30,000 people and I’d probably get it back.
It’s neat to think that people all over the place are mak-
ing bread that started out here and touched my
hands.” It is not merely in the microbiome that fer-
ments can create new communities.*

Britain and China see each other
through a narcotic haze

B E I J I N G , H U M E N A N D S Y D E N H A M H I L L

ON AUGUST 5th 1872 thousands of Londoners put on their
Sunday best and boarded trains heading for the outskirts
of the capital. Though the weather was cold and rainy,
they were determined to enjoy themselves. It was, after all, only
the second “August bank holiday” in British history: a Monday oﬀ
work on full pay—an extremely unusual treat. 
Their destination was the Crystal Palace, the world’s ﬁrst
theme park. The glass-and-iron structure, a colossal testimony to
Victorian industrial might, overlooked fountains that were com-
pared to those of Versailles. For a shilling a head (half price for chil-
dren), visitors could expect the most diverse range of exotic thrills
available in one place in one day anywhere in the country, includ-
ing the ﬁrst sculptures of dinosaurs. 
To cap it all, that evening there was to be a re-enactment of a
battle with China—“Grand Spectacle: Storming of the Chinese
Peiho Forts”, advertisements proclaimed. The strongly built re-
doubts on the desolate mud ﬂats near the northern Chinese port
of Tianjin had been overrun by British and French troops 12 years
earlier in what the New York Times called a “dashing little cam-
paign” at the end of the second Opium War. 
The daytrippers in south London would have been familiar
with their country’s conﬂicts with the Celestial Empire. The clash-
es between the two powers, one claiming global supremacy, the
other in precipitous decline, had been victories of just the sort of
industrial prowess the Crystal Palace had been built to celebrate.
The world’s ﬁrst iron warship had been deployed by Britain to
great eﬀect. They had also been squalid conﬂicts. Calling them the

“China Wars”, as the British establishment did,
sounded too grand. The general public just called
them the Opium Wars. The ﬁrst one had been trig-
gered by China’s conﬁscation of 1,000 tons of the drug
from British smugglers and its refusal to pay compen-
sation. That entirely reasonable act inﬂamed long-sim-
mering British resentment of China’s refusal to open
its doors more than a crack to foreign products, and to
be suitably deferential to British greatness. 
The subsequent battles are now largely forgotten in
Britain. From the British point of view, they were mi-
nor compared with those of the 20th century. And
they are on the other side of the peak and decline of
Britain’s imperial power, which has tended to obscure
them from view. But China has not forgotten the Opi-
um Wars. The conﬂicts were a humiliation, exposing
the hollowness of its claims to be the world’s most
powerful empire. They set it on a quest, which contin-
ues to this day, to rediscover its strength. Every Chinese
schoolchild knows that the modern drive for wealth
and power is, at root, a means of avenging the Opium
Wars and what followed. How the conﬂict is remem-
bered still matters very much.
All that mattered to the bank-holiday crowd, how-
ever, was that Britain had won. The ﬁrst war, fought in
1839-1842, had resulted in the handing over to Britain of
a desolate little island called Hong Kong and the open-

ing of ﬁve Chinese ports to foreign trade. The second, in which
Britain had joined forces with the French, was waged in 1856-1860.
It resulted in sweeping concessions on trade (including legalisa-
tion of the opium traﬃc) and access for foreigners to China’s hith-
erto closed interior. 
Many of the holiday-makers were probably aware that the Opi-
um Wars had been controversial in Britain and ﬁercely opposed
by some politicians. William Gladstone, then prime minister, had,
as a young MP in 1842, said that he did not know of a conﬂict “more
calculated in its progress to cover this country with permanent dis-
grace” than the ﬁrst Opium War. The daytrippers could have had
no inkling that the wars would put China on a course that would
eventually lead to a dictatorship inspired by the writings of two
bearded émigrés who, as it happened, were living in north-west
London at that time: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. On that bank-
holiday Monday both men were getting ready that day for a show-
down with anarchists at a forthcoming congress of the Interna-
tional Workingmen’s Association in The Hague.
Contempt for, and suspicion of, China ran deep. That summer
a new play opened in London, based on Charles Dickens’s unﬁn-
ished novel “The Mystery of Edwin Drood”. The story begins with
a seedy scene in a London opium den—by then, smoking the drug
had come to be viewed not so much as a bad habit encouraged by
the British, but as a Chinese vice menacing Britain. As Dickens put
it, opium use could even make the smoker take on “the strange
likeness of the Chinaman”, including skin colour. 
The ﬁreworks show began with a procession of boats, illumi-
nated by Chinese lanterns, on one of the lakes. Then soldiers be-
gan laying a pontoon across it towards mock Chinese forts on the
other side. A battle erupted on the water, with “Royal Navy” boats
exchanging barrages of ﬁreworks with “Chinese” junks. “Victory
was on the side of the English as a matter of course,” one newspa-
per said. The show ended with a chorus of “God Save the Queen”.
Such was Victorian fun, brimming with pomp and patriotism.
Even as late as the 1890s, more than 30 years after Britain’s last con-
ﬂict with China, the Opium Wars were still being celebrated in ex-
travagant ﬁrework tableaux. 
The Crystal Palace burned down in 1936, a spectacular blaze
visible across London. A subtle reminder of the Opium Wars ling-

ers, however, around one of the garden’s lakes. It is
fringed with evergreen mahonias, plants introduced
to Britain by Robert Fortune, a Scottish plant hunter
who found them in the 1840s after the ﬁrst Opium War
had prised open the Chinese door. He also smuggled
out 20,000 tea seedlings to Darjeeling, setting up the
Indian tea trade. Before that, China had a near monop-
oly on what was becoming Britain’s drug of choice—
frequently bought with proﬁts from opium. 

The other palace
On the northern edge of Beijing is another park that
was, in its day, frequently compared with Versailles:
Yuanmingyuan, or the Garden of Perfect Brightness. It
is an expanse of lily-ﬁlled ponds, weeping willows
and winding paths more than four times bigger than
the park at Crystal Palace. 
Here memories of the Opium Wars are very much
alive. “Never forget our national shame,” intones a
guide in front of a red-capped group of Chinese visi-
tors. Around them are the few remaining pillars and
jumbled stones of an 18th-century Western-style man-
sion designed by Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian Jesu-
it missionary. The building was part of a huge complex
of pagodas and courtyards that once ﬁlled the park—
the imperial family’s summer palace. At the end of the
second Opium War it was razed by British and French
troops in an orgy of destruction.
The soldiers began by plundering anything made
of gold or silver, smashing exquisite objects of porce-
lain and jade, and dressing themselves up for comic ef-
fect in ornate silk clothes from the imperial wardrobes.
Then, in revenge for the torture and killing of a group
of British negotiators by the Chinese, the British com-
mander ordered the complete destruction of every-
thing that remained. 
The torching of the Summer Palace stands as one of
the greatest acts of cultural vandalism of the past two
centuries. “When we ﬁrst entered the gardens they re-
minded one of those magic grounds described in fairy
tales; we marched from them upon the 19th October,
leaving them a dreary waste of ruined nothings,”
wrote one British oﬃcer. 
In 1997 Yuanmingyuan became one of the ﬁrst sites
in China to be named by the Communist Party as a
“national base for patriotic education”. The nation-
wide pro-democracy protests of 1989 had shown the
party how much it lacked the public’s support. Oﬃ-
cials hoped that teaching people about the country’s
miserable past at the hands of imperialist aggressors
would make them more supportive of the party, and
grateful for its help in making China great again. 
The list of such sites keeps growing: another 41
were added in 2017, bringing the national total to 428.
Pilgrimages to them are all but obligatory for school-
children, university students and oﬃcials. At Yuan-
mingyuan, new recruits to the party are sworn in be-
fore the ruins. Students from a nearby school celebrate
turning 18 at ceremonies here: they stand before the
scattered masonry in their best clothes, release doves
of peace and sing patriotic songs. 
As China grows stronger, it is laying ever greater
weight on its history. It wants the booty back that the
British and French seized. And there is a lot of it. In 1865
numerous pieces, gathered by a French oﬃcer, were
put on display for a few weeks in the Crystal Palace.
Many other items are now in Western collections. In
2013 two famous sculptures looted from the palace in

2 1860 were returned to China by the family of a French art collector.
Chinese buyers have purchased others and brought them home. 
The nation’s growing wealth allows it a new redress against the
plundering of the past. It can acquire symbolic treasures from else-
where itself: the London Taxi Company, maker of the famous
black cabs; House of Fraser, a retailer; Club Med, a holiday ﬁrm. In
2013 there was much excitement in London about plans by one of
China’s richest businessmen, Ni Zhaoxing, to spend £500m (then
$810m) on rebuilding the Crystal Palace. Mr Ni eventually got cold
feet, but his company has kept an article on its website that talks of
Mr Ni’s hope of “rebuilding the glory of history” in south London.
The same term is often used in China by those who dream of a re-
built Yuanmingyuan. 

Mouth of the tiger
There are no great gardens in the town of Humen, where the
brown waters of the Pearl river, having ﬂowed through an endless
sprawl of factories in the southern province of Guangdong, pre-
pare to spill into the South China Sea. British merchants called this
stretch the Bogue—an adaptation of the Portuguese translation of
Humen: Boca do Tigre, or Tiger’s Mouth. It was here, in the 19th
century, that British ships oﬄoaded their opium onto fast-moving
Chinese smuggling boats known as “centipedes”. 
The town, which in the past two decades has grown rich by
making textiles, is home to one of the country’s ﬁrst patriotic-edu-
cation bases: the 1950s-era Opium War Museum. It stands on the
site where, in 1839, Lin Zexu, a mandarin sent by the emperor, de-
stroyed the conﬁscated British opium—the act that triggered the
whole shameful aﬀair. Another museum dedicated to the Opium
Wars, the Sea Battle Museum, opened nearby in 1999. 
As it was when the British warships arrived, Guangdong is still
the drugs hub of China. When Xi Jinping became the country’s
leader in 2012, it was the biggest manufacturing centre of illegal
narcotics, and home to one-sixth of the country’s registered drug
addicts. In 2014 nearly 60% of drug-making crimes recorded by
Chinese police, mainly involving methamphetamine (“ice”) and
ketamine, occurred in the province. Following a three-year anti-
drug campaign called Operation Thunder, the authorities there
said a “turning-point” had been reached: Guangdong’s share of
drug crimes had fallen to less than 40%. But it is still number one. 
The authorities in Guangdong are acutely conscious of the his-
torical echoes. Indeed, they draw attention to them with occasion-
al public burnings of seized drugs in Humen. Underlying all dis-
cussions of the issue is always the hint that it was the British who
got China hooked on drugs in the ﬁrst place.
In occasional books and articles, a few Chinese intellectuals
ask whether the message of the Opium Wars is really as simple as
the party suggests. Huang Yanming, a pro-democracy activist in
south-west China, argues that the wars were more about the free-
dom to trade than a struggle over opium—calling them “Opium
Wars”, he says, is tantamount to “abandoning historical truth”. Ju-
lia Lovell, a British historian, makes a similar point. In her book
“The Opium War: Drugs, Dreams and the Making of China”, she
says the move into opium by British traders was not, as claimed by
many Chinese historians, a deliberate conspiracy to make narcot-
ic slaves of the Chinese. “It was a greedy, pragmatic response to a
decline in sales of other British imports,” she writes. 
A Chinese translation of Ms Lovell’s book is on prominent dis-
play in Beijing’s biggest state-run bookshop. In it she notes one rea-
son why the government was so averse to the drug: “disquiet
about the threat to stability posed by a hedonistic opium culture”.
But Frank Dikötter, a Dutch sinologist, argues in his book “Narcotic
Culture: A History of Drugs in China” that in most cases opium, in
the form smoked in 19th-century China, “did not have signiﬁcant
harmful eﬀects on either health or longevity”. “Historians of Chi-
na,” he continues, “rarely mention that any respectable person in
Europe or America could walk into a pharmacy in 1900 and rou-
tinely buy a range of hashish pastes, exotic psychedelics or mor-

phine (together with a handy injection kit), and that
opium products were widely on sale in Britain”. Opi-
um dens like those in “Edwin Drood” were a cultural
problem, not a pharmaceutical one.
In 1847 The Economist described China’s ban on
opium as “silly” (it continues to argue that prohibition
of drugs does more to boost traﬃckers’ proﬁts than to
prevent addiction). Until 1916, this newspaper listed
opium in its weekly list of commodities prices (see
above). Only in that year did Britain begin requiring a
doctor’s prescription fo its purchase.
To Mr Xi, China’s defeats in the Opium Wars are
proof that weak countries will be defeated. One of his
ﬁrst public acts after he took over was, with his Politbu-
ro colleagues, to visit an exhibition at the National Mu-
seum in Beijing called “The Road to Revival”. It begins
with the outbreak of the ﬁrst Opium War and ends
with China’s rise under the Communist Party, repre-
sented, among other things, by nuclear missiles. The
message is clear: don’t mess with us again. 
But Mr Xi ignores another conclusion that could be
drawn from China’s defeats: that an autocratic politi-
cal system fearful of Western ideas was at least partly
to blame for China’s weakness. The Daoguang emper-
or, whose ﬁght against opium led to the ﬁrst war, was a
jittery conservative—“an anxious ruler…searching for
a scapegoat for the country’s many troubles”, as Ms
Lovell puts it. Some Chinese liberals wonder whether
painting foreigners, be they Westerners or Japanese, as
a threat may serve a similar purpose today. 
Museums in China have barely any wriggle room
to question the oﬃcial line. But at the Sea Battle Muse-
um in Humen, which re-opened a year ago after a re-
furbishment costing nearly 60m yuan ($9m), it is pos-
sible to detect some head-scratching. 
The new display sticks to the oﬃcial line, with mo-
tion-sensing video games allowing visitors to shoot at
British ships by ﬂailing their arms. But the exhibits end
on an unusual note: a list of questions about what
would have followed if the imperial government had
acted diﬀerently. What if, for example, it had been
“brave enough to step forward” after its ﬁrst defeat and
declare learning from the West a priority? Would the
second Opium War have happened? The display of-
fers no answers. To do so would court the wrath of a
party that does not want to be told that a lack of reform
may have played a part in China’s 19th century suﬀer-
ings. Instead, the museum plays safe with the closing
words: “There are no ‘what ifs’ in history.” *

The events that grabbed the world’s
attention in 2017

T HERE is no doubt that the world
ﬁnds President Trump fascinating.
He appeared on the cover of The
Economist nine times in 2017—a record for
any one person in a year. He also upped
the stakes by suggesting that anything criti-
cal of him or his agenda was “fake news”.
Plenty of people read it anyway. 
Yet statistics show that online news-
hounds are as interested in disasters and
scandals as they are in politics. Chartbeat,
a company that tracks online readership
for 8,000 news publishers in 50 countries,
provided its daily readership data for 2017
to The Economist. About half the data come
from English-speaking countries, a quarter
from Europe. The chart draws on three mil-
lion articles—2.5bn words in all—covering
the most signiﬁcant events of the year. 
Mr Trump’s inauguration attracted
4.4m hours of readership. But
just as
crowds for the women’s march a few days
later were bigger than his, so was the num-
ber of people reading about it (6m). Both
were overtaken by the hoo-ha around the
president’s attempt to restrict travel from
some Muslim countries. That consumed
19m hours of readers’ time between Janu-
ary and March and 40m hours over the
year. Other presidential travails kept the at-
tention, too. Eﬀorts to repeal Obamacare,
the ﬁring of an FBI chief and investigating
Russian meddling garnered 60m hours. 
Meanwhile, German and French elec-
tions barely registered globally, nor did
events in Myanmar, Kenya or Japan,
though coverage of Syria drew 36m hours
of readership and Islamic State 33m. Peo-
ple spent ﬁve times longer (8.5m hours)
reading about a non-Muslim shooter kill-
ing 58 in Las Vegas in October than they did
reading about a Muslim suicide-bomber
killing 22 in Manchester in May.
Attempts at national and regional re-
alignment did better—Brexit, and Catalo-
nia’s push for independence, together
earned 24m hours of viewing. On 10th Sep-
tember Hurricane Irma’s pounding of Flor-
ida gained the most attention (2.5m hours)
of any story on one day. Total coverage of
Irma drew four times the readership of
Hurricane Maria’s hitting Puerto Rico. 
Scandal sells. The downfall of Harvey
Weinstein, a ﬁlm producer, because of alle-
gations of assault, attracted 15m hours of at-
tention. Royalty sells, too. Ratko Mladic
and Robert Mugabe could not compete
with Prince Harry’s
engagement
to
Meghan Markle, which saw 3m hours of
traﬃc. A good old-fashioned love story?
Now, that’s real news. *

Since1989 and the slaughterofthe Tiananmen Square pro-democracyprotesters, political reform in China hasbeen oﬀthe table. Partyand state are in eﬀectone.In contrast, startingaround the turn ofthe century, the Com-munistPartyofVietnam hasencouraged more pluralism. Clearerdistinctionshave been made between partyand state. Top postssuch asgeneral secretaryofthe party, state president, prime min-isterand memberofthe Politburo have increasinglybeen ﬁlledbycompetitive elections, albeitwithin the elite ofthe party. In2010 the local partycongressin Danangheld directelections forthe municipal leadership, a ﬁrst. More broadlya degree ofdissentiscondoned. Some Vietnamese, includingretired oﬃcials andgenerals, have argued thatVietnam’send-station should bemultipartydemocracy. In MrXi’sChina such airingsare outofthe question.MrTrongremainsjusta ﬁrstamongequalsin a collective lead-ership. He headsthe partybutnotthe state.

He mayeven overturn convention and seek an-otherterm in oﬃce in 2022 aftera decade in power.Growing a partyThisdivergence maywell widen.

Vladimir’s choice 

The belief that nationalism
could fade away was always
naive. The real question is
what form it will take 

M O S C OW , T O R O N T O A N D W A R S AW

JAN PIETRZAK has just one demand. He’s not fussy about the de-
sign of the centennial arch with which he wants to mark the Pol-
ish victory over the Bolshevik armies in 1920. But he does insist
that it must be taller than the 237-metre (778-foot) Palace of Culture
and Science, given to the Polish nation by Stalin. 
Mr Pietrzak is a gruﬀ old man with white hair and a ﬁne, bushy
moustache, a popular entertainer best known for a patriotic song
that became an anthem for Solidarity in the 1980s. Although the
Warsaw authorities have balked at his dream of a triumphal arch,
he has the backing of the Law and Justice party, which forms the
national government. It will be a symbol, he says: “Young people
…will know that Poland was victorious—like Trafalgar Square.” 
The Battle of Warsaw was indeed glorious. The Polish army,
facing utter defeat, miraculously stopped the Russians’ advance
on the capital. Your correspondent married into a family that still
remembers how, during the ﬁghting, grandfather Leon had 17 hors-
es shot from under him. Twenty years later, as Poles were being
lined up and murdered in the forest of Katyn, a Russian oﬃcer he
had spared returned the favour, oﬀering him the choice of the bul-
let or the gulag. Against the oﬃcer’s advice, Leon asked to live. 
Commemoration is never just about past valour and suﬀering.
It is about present priorities. Poland is in the grip of a new nation-
alism. Mr Pietrzak says Law and Justice, which took power in 2015,
is the ﬁrst government to serve Poles well; its predecessors were re-
sponsible for a “long tradition of betrayal and treason” with re-
spect to Germany and Russia. Not long ago only a few hundred
people turned up to the annual Independence Day parade. This
November 60,000 Poles marched alongside two radical-
nationalist groups toting banners saying: “Clean blood” and “Eu-

rope will be white or deserted”.
Wherever you look, nationalism is rising. Some-
times it takes the form of self-declared nations de-
manding the right to determine their future: Catalonia
in Spain and Kurdistan in Iraq, Scotland in Britain and
Biafra in Nigeria. More often it is a lurch to the populist
and reactionary right. The Alternative for Germany
has won 94 seats in the Bundestag. Marine Le Pen of
the National Front won a third of the vote in France’s
presidential election. In Hungary, Austria and the
Czech Republic nationalists have taken power, just as
they did in Poland. In post-referendum Britain they
have “taken back control”, or at least pretended to. Tur-
key is militant, Japan is shedding its paciﬁsm, India is
toying with Hindu supremacy, China dreams of glory
and Russia is belligerent. 
Most remarkable is the nationalist turn in the Un-
ited States. America was the ﬁrst nation to declare it-
self independent of all sovereigns save its people and
constitution. It has always seen itself as a place apart.
But for most of its history this exceptionalism has been
a form of self-regarding universalism; in time, the rest
of the world would catch up. Now it has an angry, na-
tivist president who sees America not leading, but be-
ing left behind—and vows to make it great again.
People who cross borders and cultures easily, and
who prosper as they do so, ﬁnd this new nationalism
disturbing. They see it hindering peaceful countries
from trading, mingling and co-operating on the

world’s problems. But they tend to think that it will pass, like a fe-
ver. It may put oﬀ the day when the diﬀerences between nations
ﬁnally melt away; it does not mean that day will never come. 
That is to brush aside what is happening far too lightly. Nation-
alism is an abiding legacy of the Enlightenment. It has embedded
itself in global politics more completely and more successfully
than any of the Enlightenment’s more celebrated legacies, includ-
ing Marxism, classical liberalism and even industrial capitalism. It
is not an aberration. It is here to stay. Putting aside the concerns of a
cosmopolitan elite, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Like religion,
nationalism is capable of bringing out the best in people as well as
the worst. It can inspire them to bind together freely in pursuit of
the common good. But it can also ﬁll them with a terrifying, righ-
teous certainty, breeding strife and injustice. 
Sadly, the new nationalism plays to the paranoid, intolerant
side of this legacy. It sees every “citizen of the world” as a “citizen
of nowhere”, in the mocking phrase of Theresa May, Britain’s
prime minister. When the citizens of the world call them bigots,
the nationalists retort that the citizens of nowhere are traitors. That
turns politics into a test of loyalty. When nations eye each other
with contempt, the global order which was stitched together after
the second world war under American leadership starts to come
asunder. Geopolitics becomes a free-for-all. 
To see where this leads you need a handle on what national-
ism is and how it works. What connects a skinhead wrapped in
the ﬂag of St George to a granny waving at the Queen with a Union
Flag on a stick? When Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Law and
Justice, whips up one of the mass-meetings at which he peddles
conspiracy theories on a chilly Tuesday evening, what alchemy
persuades each member of his audience that he is summoning an
ancient and personal loyalty? Why would someone avoid talking
to a stranger on the bus but lay down her life for him on the battle-
ﬁeld? The answers draw on politics, philosophy and psychology.
But they begin with history.
NATIONS have existed for centuries. Nationalism came of
age in Valmy, in northern France, on September 20th 1792,
round about noon. 
That was when, in an engagement as mythologised as the Bat-
tle of Warsaw, French volunteers confronted a superior army of
Prussian regulars under the Duke of Brunswick. In the crucial mo-
ment, General François Kellermann brandished his hat on the end
of his sword and roared “Vive la nation!” From battalion after bat-
talion the cry went up, a wave that carried the citizen-soldiers to
triumph. 
It was the ﬁrst victory of the Revolutionary War, claimed for the
nation not the king. It inspired the National Convention in Paris to
be done with the monarchy. A stunned Europe grasped that the di-
vine rule of kings really was coming to an end. The order that re-
placed it was built on three philosophical claims: 
1) Legitimacy is not handed down from God; it surges up from
the people. Thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau and John Locke
drew on a well-established sense of nationhood, particularly vis-
ible in England, to explain how individual citizens have the right
to join freely in a nation that will protect and beneﬁt them. Three
years before Valmy, Article III of the Declaration of the Rights of
Man had said: “The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially
in the nation. No body nor individual may exercise any authority
which does not proceed directly from the nation.”
2) Government is not just an agreement between individuals,
but also a statement of the nation’s general will. As Rousseau ar-
gued, individual rights can be qualiﬁed: a state wields its power in
the name of the collective. Scholars quarrel over whether Rous-
seau meant to trample on individual rights or protect them from
the majority, but governments have used and abused the princi-
ple ever since. 
3) Each nation is diﬀerent. By the time Napoleon was invading

*Independent political actors
with control of terr itor y

his neighbours, France’s fraternal claim to be spread-
ing the universal virtues of liberty and equality looked
to the rest of Europe very much like brazen conquest.
German thinkers turned to the philosopher Johann
Gottfried Herder, who insisted that each nation is
shaped by its own unique past and that its true essence
emerges from history, culture and, ultimately, race. The
French could not impose their version of liberty and
equality; only Germans could know what those ideas
mean for the powers and principalities that would
eventually form Germany. 
Nationalism slips and slides between these three
divergent claims. Flag-waving patriots who get weepy
over the Olympic games and the poems of Rudyard
Kipling draw on history and culture, but go easy on the
general will. Civic nationalists, from places like Brazil,
America and Australia that are largely made up of im-
migrants, exalt universal values and the example their
nation sets in pursuing them. They dally with Rous-
seau’s general will, urging newcomers to assimilate,
but tread lightly on race and culture, which are not
shared. Ethnic nationalists mine race and history to
create a politics that sacriﬁces individual liberty to the
will of the majority. 
Some seek to have the good parts of this melange
without the bad. Thinkers like George Orwell and Elie
Kedourie have argued that patriotism—tolerant, wel-
coming and reasonable—really has nothing to do with
nationalism. It is a comforting thought; it separates de-
cent people from the bigots who cling blindly to their
own nation’s superiority. But one person’s patriotism
is another’s prejudice. In 1917 the Indian writer Rabin-
dranath Tagore lamented how “the people which
loves freedom perpetuates slavery in a large portion of
the world with the comfortable feeling of pride in hav-
ing done its duty.” Genial English patriots were blind
to the harm they caused. 
The late Benedict Anderson, an Irish political scien-
tist, called modern nations “imagined communities”—
imagined because people are drawn together within
them who have not met and never will. It is the power
of such imagination that allows an essentially modern
doctrine like nationalism to feel so deeply rooted in
the past. Today’s Polish nationalists hark back to the
country’s commonwealth with Lithuania, which at its
height, in the 17th century, was one of Europe’s great
powers. Zimbabwe takes its name from ruins aban-
doned hundreds of years before the country’s bound-
aries were carved out by colonialists. Germany’s 19th-
century nationalists romanticised the tribes who
fought the Roman legions—which is why Wagner

throngs with spear maidens and knuckleheaded heroes. 
Today’s nations are, in a sense, products of nationalism, rather
than, as nationalists might claim, it is of them. Ten years ago Po-
land had a couple of magazines that dealt with history; now it has
a dozen. The Battle of Warsaw is celebrated, with other land-
marks, on T-shirts produced by a popular fashion brand, called
Red is Bad. Though having such history to hand is a help, pure fan-
tasy can be drafted into the mythmaking, too. Other Red is Bad de-
signs feature valiant Poles battling Nazi cyborgs and Teutonic
knights depicted as villains from “The Lord of the Rings”. 
The manipulation of history and culture has a long tradition.
The French army beat the Prussians at Valmy because of its profes-
sional gunners, rather than its citizen volunteers. Diponegoro,
whom Indonesians hail as a national hero for opposing Dutch co-
lonial rule in the 19th century, intended to conquer Java, not to lib-
erate it; Anderson noted that he seems to have had no concept of
who the Dutch were nor any desire to expel them. When Italy was
uniﬁed in 1861, only 2.5% of the population spoke standard Italian.
Massimo d’Azeglio, a leading patriot, declared: “We have made It-
aly; now we must make Italians.” So much for Herder’s unique
community bound by language and culture. 
This process of national construction can be harnessed for vio-
lence and hatred. Simon Winder, an author and publisher, exag-
gerated when he said on BBC radio some months ago that “nation-
alism always starts oﬀ with folk-dancing and ends up with barbed
wire”. But such journeys are all too easy, especially when nation-
alism is contaminated by theories of racial purity. Then it was able
to fuel the Nazi drive to “protect” ethnic Germans in neighbouring
countries, and to permit the building of concentration camps and
gas chambers. That spectre has haunted nationalism ever since. 
But nationalism has liberated oppressed people as often as it
has ﬁred up anti-Semites. In the 19th century, beneath the carapace
of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, liberals and rad-
icals built movements of national liberation. After the ﬁrst world
war, when Woodrow Wilson, America’s president, championed
the principle of national self-determination, these new nations
emerged, blinking, into sunlight, a process typically accompanied
by national anthems that sounded like subpar Verdi. 
Once Europeans had accepted self-determination, it was just a
matter of time before Africans and Asians founded national-liber-
ation movements of their own. James Mayall, a British academic,
points out that European powers could sustain empires only so
long as they believed that their imperial subjects were barbarians
who did not count as people with rights. When the Europeans’ ar-
guments were turned back against them, their great empires col-
lapsed under the weight of their own contradictions. 
A new internationalism was born; cosmopolitans
looked with pleasure on the United Nations, alike in
dignity, diverse in their national dress. They saw a
world of nations which, in the words of the 19th-cen-
tury writer Ernest Renan, “serve the common cause of
civilisation; each holds one note in the concert of hu-
manity.” Liberal multiculturalism carries an echo of
the same feeling, promising a civic nationalism so
strong and legitimate that Herder’s diﬀerent peoples
can jostle along within it, separate yet united.
A lot of movements—most notably Marxism—have
aimed to surpass the nation. None has succeeded. De-
legates to a pan-Slavic congress in the mid-19th century
could not understand each other and had to fall back
on German. Pan-Arabism and Negritude failed to un-
ite the Middle East or Africa. Far from creating a post-
national caliphate, Islamic State and al-Qaeda have di-
vided Sunni Islam. 
The most ambitious attempt to lay nationalism to
rest is the European Union. It has succeeded in that
war between EU members is unthinkable. But the
European nation state has not withered away as some

of the pioneers hoped. National governments still run
Brussels, national machinery is hard to dismantle and
institutions, such as the press and the bureaucracy,
cannot easily be unplugged. Someone, somewhere al-
ways seems to want to hang on to power. 
Instead, as empires have fallen apart, Wilson’s
principle of national self-determination has spread
around the world. The philosophy that nations are
sovereign and uniquely able to say what suits them is
incorporated into the bedrock of the UN, the Bretton
Woods institutions and the whole of international
law. Everything else follows from it.
Indeed, nationalism has become so much a part of
the backdrop that you hardly notice it—except, as to-
day, when there is a crisis.
T O REACH the Moscow oﬃce of Aleksandr Du-
gin you must ﬁrst pass through the looking glass.
The lift is so small and cramped that you can
smell last night’s vodka. On Mr Dugin’s ﬂoor you ﬁle
along endless half-decorated corridors that seem to
confound geometry by turning left at every corner.
The man himself, tall and ascetic, hair swept back from
a high forehead, is a visitor from the 19th century.
His ideas are very inﬂuential among Russian na-
tionalists. They are also odd and mystical, involving
Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, as a sort of tsar who
subsumes the identity of all Russians. “For us, the tsar
is the subject and we are people of the subject,” he says
enigmatically. “Human rights are the rights of the tsar.” 
Some of his compatriots would diﬀer on this point,
Mr Dugin concedes. But he insists that, were he to re-
cast it as Russia’s holy right to be reunited with Crimea,
he would command wide agreement. It is always the
same: when the West tries to impose what it sees as
universal human rights, democracy and the rule of
law, it is a denial of the Russian way of life. The West
could leave us alone, he says, “but you never do…You
think everyone should be like you.” 
Here, Mr Dugin is surely right. Since the second
world war the West has preached that liberty, law and
democracy are universal—something The Economist
endorses. Much of the world is not so sure. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Francis Fu-
kuyama, an American political scientist, famously
wrote that humanity had reached the end of history,
because the only system of beliefs left standing was
liberal, democratic capitalism. Led by America, the
West energetically promoted this vision, both in its for-
mal foreign policy and through NGOs and think-tanks.
Its suasion mostly used example and encouragement,
urging supply-side reform, deregulation and privatisa-
tion. Occasionally, in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and
Libya, it used force. 
But when Communism fell, liberalism was not the
Enlightenment’s only remaining legacy. Mr Fukuyama
reckoned without nationalism, which he expected to
fade away. Just as 19th-century Germans thought Revo-
lutionary cries of liberty, fraternity and equality were
camouﬂage for French conquest, so the leaders of Rus-
sia, China, India, Turkey and others have seen the
West’s promotion of universal values as a cynical ploy
to subvert their rule and their ambitions. 
In 19th-century Europe the Germans insisted that
only they could say what was best for the Germany
they were building. Likewise, today’s nationalists
make Dugin-like claims that their values are diﬀerent

Nationalism

The Economist December 23rd 2017

Trump has tossed aside that common cause. If each
country deﬁnes its own values, what holds the alli-
ance together?
The new nationalism does not just insist on the dif-
ferences between countries, it also thrives on the an-
ger within them. Michal Bilewicz, a social psycholo-
gist at the University of Warsaw, explains this anger in
terms of what his profession calls “agency”—the pow-
er to control your own life. Nationalism is determined
not by patriotic ardour, he argues, but by self-esteem.
Loyalty to the nation combined with conﬁdence and
trust favours altruism. By contrast, feelings of frustra-
tion and inadequacy tend to lead to narcissism. 
Men and women lacking in, or deprived of, agency
look to nationalism to assure them that, in their own
way, they are as good as everyone else—better, even. It
is just that the world does not give them the respect
they deserve. They are quick to identify with those
they see as on their side and to show contempt for oth-
ers, Mr Bilewicz says. At the same time they are ob-
sessed by how others see them. Their world is that of
Carl Schmitt, a German Nazi and constitutional law-
yer, who believed such conﬂict to be the fundamental
stuﬀ of politics, both within nations and between
them: “The distinction speciﬁc to politics…is that be-
tween friend and enemy.” In Schmitt’s view, politics is
a kind of civil war. Everything boils down to loyalty. 
Here is how altruists contrast with narcissists: 

Look to the future—Rake over the past
Positive-sum—Zero-sum 
Share—Exclude 
Work together—Gang up 
Improvement—Struggle 
Opponents complement—Opponents are traitors
Immigrants add variety—They threaten our way of life 
United by values—United by race and culture.

Altruists acknowledge a chequered past, give thanks
for today’s blessings and look forward to a better fu-
ture—a straight line sloping up across time. Narcissists
exalt in a glorious past, denigrate a miserable present
and promise a magniﬁcent future—a rollercoaster U-
curve, with today in its pit. This geometry explains
why nationalist books such as “The French Suicide”
and “Germany Destroying Itself” can succeed while
appearing to do down the very nation they worship. If
you need a rule of thumb for assessing a nationalist
movement, ascending ramp v switchback U is as good
as you are likely to get. 
The citizens of nowhere have a point when they
root the new nationalism in economic inequality; but
the driving force is not absolute poverty so much as a
relative loss of agency. Mr Bilewicz’s narcissistic na-
tionalists feel that the disruptions to the economy
caused by globalisation and technological change
have increasingly rigged it against them. Their hard
work—real or imagined—goes unrewarded while self-
serving elites and the minorities who enjoy their fa-
vour reap privileged access to wealth and power. Bu-
reaucrats obsessed by political correctness give immi-
grants jobs, houses and places in local schools, while
the nationalist’s loyalty to the nation, which is held to
stretch back generations, is rewarded only by sneering
and disdain. 
The impotence and insecurity felt by large num-
bers in developed countries shows that an important
lesson has been forgotten. In “Ill Fares the Land”, writ-
ten in 2010 as he lay dying, the British historian Tony
Judt described how post-war democracies were trans-

from the West’s and just as valid. A new, conﬁdent middle class in,
say, India and China often agrees. Many of its members want re-
spect, not lectures on how to behave. 
The attempt to repel Western universalism has been stunning-
ly successful. The International Criminal Court, which opened its
doors in 2002, and the doctrine known as the Responsibility to
Protect (R2P), approved by the UN as recently as 2005, were sup-
posed to embody the new, end-of-history consensus that the inter-
national community should police crimes against humanity. But
the court has been a disappointment and R2P has fallen into dis-
use. The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya from Rakhine state in Myan-
mar this year has elicited a lot of noise, but very little action. As
famine and disease pick over the carcass of Yemen, torn apart by a
pointless war, the world is busy looking the other way. 
Once, America would have stepped in. But the champion of
universal values has undergone a dramatic change of heart. Rex
Tillerson, America’s secretary of state, told his dismayed dip-
lomats this year that his priorities were security and the economy.
Promoting American values had, he said, become an “obstacle”. 
President Donald Trump could not have been clearer when he
addressed the UN’s General Assembly last September: “We do not
expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or
even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to up-
hold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of
their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.” 
To grasp how much ground Mr Trump has surrendered, consid-
er that two world wars led America’s leaders to conclude they
needed to make the world safe for their country. That meant forg-
ing a broad-shouldered alliance based on democracy, the rule of
law and an open economy. It was the most powerful alliance in
history, based on an intense civic nationalism that promoted
Western values. By endorsing the world of blood and soil, Mr

cause themselves harm. If there are enough Vladimirs,
these choices will feed oﬀ each other. Nationalist lead-
ers are highly sensitive to their own injured pride.
They are less sensitive to the fact that other countries
have pride, too. Poland has fallen out with its most im-
portant ally, Germany. Turkey is blasting the EU, its big-
gest trading partner. Venezuela’s pursuit of the Bolivar-
ian revolution has taken the country over a precipice.
In this light, Britain’s vote to take back control from
Eurocrats, the European Parliament and the court in
Luxembourg looks like an uprising by the English—or
rather the English outside London—who opted for
Brexit. (The Welsh chose narrowly to leave, London-
ers, the Scots and the Northern Irish to stay.) 
Fintan O’Toole, an Irish journalist, thinks this upris-
ing showed how the English have refused to accept
their decline. The United Kingdom and great-power
politics once ampliﬁed Englishness: both have now
fallen away. The surrender of sovereignty to Brussels
felt like another rung on the ladder towards mediocri-
ty. But, says Mr O’Toole, English nationalism is naive.
“Wrapped for so long in the protective blankets of Brit-
ishness and empire,” he says, “[England] has not had
to test itself in the real conditions of 21st-century life for
a middle-sized global economy.” 
In its negotiations with the remainder of the EU
and the rest of the world, Britain will have to surrender
sovereignty once again while at the same time coming
to terms with its lost inﬂuence—evaporated when it de-
cided to relinquish its membership of the EU. Britain
never faced up to the hard-nosed calculations about
whether Brexit is likely to leave it better oﬀ. Anyone
who expressed doubts in the campaign was accused
of insuﬃcient patriotism. Since the vote, that charge
has swollen into full-blown treachery. 
Bigger still is what Mr Trump’s nationalism means
for the United States. In that speech to the UN General
Assembly he described a world in which each country

ﬁxed by the fear that fascism or Bolshevism could once again spell-
bind the masses. Democracy was fragile, they thought; they were
determined that the mistakes of 1914 to 1945 should never be re-
peated. So they tried to ensure that economies grew in ways that
beneﬁted all those who participated in them and provided safety
nets for those who could not. Karl Marx believed the working
class needed a revolution to get justice. Western democracies gave
it welfare states and Great Societies instead. 
Judt’s argument was that this system was breaking down. He
blamed the market reforms of the 1980s for enriching the elite at
the expense of the rest and for destroying the sense that everyone
is in the same boat. Yet, in some ways, he was not suﬃciently pes-
simistic. In his eagerness to condemn the market-loving Ronald
Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, who led America and Britain in
the 1980s, Judt ignored the ways in which wasteful and unrespon-
sive bureaucracies had, even in their heyday and their European
redoubt, frequently failed the people they were supposed to help. 
Judt issued a dying warning: “We have entered an age of inse-
curity: economic insecurity, physical insecurity, political insecuri-
ty.” Populist politicians—almost always nationalist—exploit those
insecurities. Claiming a special connection to “the people”, they
tell and retell their narratives of corrupt elites, crooked immi-
grants, misleading media and sinister conspiracies. Social media,
which amplify outrage, are the ideal vehicle to spread the word.
Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines, has a “keyboard
army” to purvey his half-truths. Mr Trump uses Twitter to shout
his Schmitt-like distinctions between friend and foe. Nigel Farage,
of the UK Independence Party, fans grievance and discontent.
Often the populists are from the hard right. Edmund Fawcett, a
writer on political philosophy who was on the staﬀ of this news-
paper for many years, points out that the right has always rebelled
against the creative destruction wrought by progress. Liberals (in
the British sense) try to deal with change through tolerance, edu-
cation, material improvement and ensuring that no set interest
ever dominates. Conservatives, however, look to tradition, hierar-
chy, deference, protectionism and orthodoxy to keep the chaos at
bay. Some have never abandoned their belief that only a strong,
ethnic culture and a powerful government can keep them safe.
Such people are the backbone of the new nationalism.
SOCIAL scientists tell a story about a peasant
called Vladimir. One day God comes down to
him and says: “I will give you one wish. You can
name anything you want and I will grant it to you.” 
Vladimir starts to celebrate, but then God lays
down a condition. “Whatever you choose,” He says, “I
will give to your neighbour twice over.” 
Vladimir frowns and thinks. And then he clicks his
ﬁngers. “I have it,” he says. “Lord, please take out one
of my eyes!” 
In a sense, Vladimir was blind all along. Fixated by
status, he could not bear to see his neighbour do better
than him, even if he had to suﬀer to prevent it. 
Social scientists use Vladimir’s choice to explain
the seemingly irrational behaviour of subjects in psy-
chological experiments. But it is tempting to project
that same frame of mind onto nationalists obsessed by
their own greatness. You might think that the answer
to economic insecurity would be schools, roads and
other civic improvements, but the new nationalists
prefer triumphal arches to cycle lanes. Monuments are
a (temporary) remedy for their lack of self-esteem. Na-
tionalism gets in the way of clear thinking, because it
turns politics into Schmitt’s contest between friends
and enemies, rather than the creation of common pro-
jects arrived at from diverse outlooks. 
Time and again, nationalists make choices that

2 looks out for itself, a “world of proud, independent na-
tions that embrace their duties, seek friendship, re-
spect others, and make common cause in the greatest
shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for
the people of this wonderful Earth.” 
A “pluralism of national bigotries”, as one thinker
once called such a system, may indeed lead to a stable
world. Roger Scruton, a conservative British philoso-
pher, argues that nations ﬁnd it easier to live side by
side than religions do. For peace and security, John Stu-
art Mill argued, self-determination is necessary. 
But is it suﬃcient? The institutions that shape the
world and keep it running smoothly have required an
order guaranteed by America, as well as the self-deter-
mination of others. Mr Trump’s readiness to walk
away from the system could do it permanent harm. 
Take, for example, his decision to quit the Trans-Pa-
ciﬁc Partnership (TPP) right at the start of his presiden-
cy. Throughout the campaign, Mr Trump rubbished
the 12-member trade pact as a bad deal for America—
partly because he thinks America has more negotiat-
ing clout in bilateral deals, partly because he wants to
do down his predecessor, who had championed it. 
Ditching the TPP was not only bad for America’s economy. It
also hurt Asian security. The deal would have created a conduit to
channel China’s expansion, aligning it with today’s institutions
and removing its incentive to overturn them. Mr Trump said he
was acting to make America great again. Instead, he let down its al-
lies and handed China an invitation to shape the world. 
Mr Trump’s foreign policy has its episodes of engagement, such
as the cruise-missile attack which followed Syria’s gassing of civil-
ians. But it is dominated by structural withdrawals, as from the
TPP and the Paris climate-change agreement. Eventually this could
leave the world without a leading power for the ﬁrst time since
1945. Insecurity—instability—would go global. The closest parallel
would be 19th-century Europe after the fall of Napoleon. For al-
most a century Metternich, Talleyrand, Castlereagh and their suc-
cessor statesmen managed a delicate balance that avoided conti-
nental-scale wars even as national fortunes ebbed and ﬂowed. 
To re-run that diplomatic feat would be extraordinarily hard.
Unlike today’s leaders, 19th-century Europeans came from a single
intellectual tradition. Britain, as the strongest power, shifted its
weight to ensure that no other country ever thought that it could
prevail through war. In the world of 2017 no country is available to
play that role. Back then there was no Twitter or 24-hour news,
leaving statesmen freer to make concessions over brandy and ci-
gars. Nineteenth-century European powers competed against
each other by building empires; that option is no longer available. 
The European peace came crashing down in 1914, partly be-
cause Germany’s rise led it to outgrow the system holding it back.
Today’s peace will also be tested, as America faces up to the need
to accommodate an ambitious China. Mr Trump’s promise to
Make America Great Again will not make that any easier. 
Unlike in the 19th century, some nations have nuclear weap-
ons. That will focus minds on peace. Until it doesn’t. 
I T WAS 2pm on October 13th 2017 and 48 people were about to
become Canadian citizens. The judge welcoming them to the
Ontario Science Centre that Friday afternoon was Albert
Wong, himself an immigrant. 
In most countries those who are born citizens think that immi-
grants are lucky to get in. But Mr Wong thanked his 48 new compa-
triots for the sacriﬁces they had made in leaving behind their
homes. Later Yasmin Ratansi, MP for the local riding, stressed that
Canada has expectations of its citizens—to contribute to the com-
munity, respect women and obey the law. “You must ensure that
Canada is as proud of you as you are of Canada,” she said. After-

wards, when everyone had eaten a slice of cake, some
members of the Ojibway nation invited Canada’s
newest citizens to join them in a tribal dance that
snaked around the meeting hall. 
Canada is ﬁercely nationalistic in its way. Just like
any other form of intense nationalism, the Canadian
sort can be oﬀ-putting. But even though it sometimes
strays into smugness and sermonising, Canada has
something important to teach an uncertain world. 
In emerging countries a growing new middle class
wants its own set of civic clothes, not a collection of ill-
ﬁtting ideological hand-me-downs from the West.
They have yet to decide whether to join the pageant of
liberal democracies in a way they think will suit them,
or to turn aside and march on alone. In the West na-
tionalists have to choose between looking out and
looking in. Will they be sucked into a fascination with
triumphal arches, glorious sacriﬁces and the obses-
sion with loyalty and betrayal? Or will they embrace a
civic sort of nationalism instead, comfortable with
themselves and the world around them? 
Canada hints at a resolution of these conﬂicts be-
tween civic and ethnic nationalism. Its politics gravi-
tates towards cohesion. Michael Adams, who has a
new book arguing that the Trump revolution could not
have happened north of the border, points out that a
Canadian prime minister has to win the cities; and
you cannot win the cities by pitching for the white
vote alone. He says that what Canadians see in Ameri-
ca only reinforces their openness. “We’re global,” he
says, “and we’re becoming more xenophilic.”  
The country marked the 150th anniversary of its
confederation with refreshingly unstuﬀy and nostal-
gia-free celebrations. In the capital, Ottawa, they held
a skating race on the Rideau Canal, a world-heritage
site. A French street-theatre company entertained the
crowds with giant puppet-ﬁgures. Canada is—belated-
ly—facing up to its mistreatment of its ﬁrst nations. A
light show at Miwate acknowledged the sacred im-
portance of the Chaudière Falls to the Algonquins and
marked the end of their industrial exploitation. Guy
Laﬂamme, the main organiser for the city, admits that
Canada still has problems with race. “But,” he says,
“we’ve developed a model that’s pretty exemplary.”  
That model celebrates diﬀerence and rewards col-
laboration. Canadians like to say that the cold winters
forced them to work together to survive. Quebec,
where years of anti-French prejudice led to a powerful
drive for independence, obliged them to accept that
there is room for more than one culture on equal
terms. They have a mosaic, not a melting pot. They
have found a way to celebrate cultural diﬀerences and
wrap them in a bundle of all-enveloping tolerance. It is
not a choice between cultural exceptionalism and
moral universalism, but a benign mix of both. 
Towards the end of the citizenship ceremony, Paul
Martin, a former prime minister, rose to speak to the
people who had come to his country from around the
planet. He told them that Canada was now theirs to
mould and improve. He congratulated Mr Wong on
having the best job in the world. And he spoke about
how his own father, as secretary of state in 1967, had
opened Canada’s borders to immigrants from outside
Europe. “It was the right thing to do then,” Mr Martin
said, “and it is the right thing to do now.”*

A language both ancient and modern

An old tongue’s
new tricks

R E Y K J A V I K

I T IS hardly surprising that Icelanders have names for the many
diﬀerent ﬁsh that abound in their surrounding waters—the va-
rious types of cod, herring and so on which they have been
catching for centuries. It is rather more surprising that they have
not just one word for the coelacanth, but three. After all, the living
fossils of the Indian Ocean’s depths hardly impinge on their Atlan-
tic way of life—and if an Icelander found a pressing need to talk
about them, why not just use the Greek word, as other nations do?
But Icelanders are keen namers of things—and would never dream
of simply adopting a transliterated version of someone else’s
word. So they call the coelacanth skúfur, which means “tassel”. Or
skúfuggi: tassel-ﬁn. Or sometimes forniskúfur: “ancient tassel”. 
Icelanders are ﬁercely proud of their tongue and stay actively
involved in its maintenance. On Icelandic Language Day they cel-
ebrate those among the population of 340,000 who have done
the most for it. They love the links it gives them to their past. Ordin-
ary Icelanders revel in their ability to use phrases from the sagas—
written around eight centuries ago—in daily life. The commenta-
tor who says that a football team is bíta í skjaldarrendur (“biting its
shield-end”) as it ﬁghts on in the face of great odds, is behaving
quite normally in borrowing an image from ancient tales of Viking
derring-do (one of the castles in the British Museum’s 12th-century
Lewis chess-set records the metaphor in walrus ivory).
The result is something close to unique—a language that is at
the same time modern (it can happily express concepts such as
podcasting), pure (it borrows very few words from any other ton-
gue) and ancient (it is far closer to the ancestral Norse tongue than
its increasingly distant cousins, Danish and Norwe-
gian). Its complex grammar has barely changed in al-
most a thousand years and has a distinct old-worldli-
ness. But if, like the forniskúfur, Icelandic is a living
fossil, it is a lovely and lively one. 
Ingólfur Arnason brought the ﬁrst settlers from
Norway to Iceland in 874AD. They spoke the common
language used throughout Scandinavia often called
“donsk tunga” (“Danish tongue”) or, by others, some
version of “northern” (the origin of “Norse”, “Norwe-
gian” and “Norman”). From early on they were partic-

ularly keen on using it to write things down; much of
what is known about Viking culture comes from Ice-
landic texts. In the 13th century Snorri Sturluson pro-
duced the Prose Edda, one of the earliest and most im-
portant accounts of the antics of Thor, Frigg, Loki and
their kith and kin. Icelanders also looked self-con-
sciously at their own history, producing the sagas: gen-
eration-spanning tales of family, honour, feuds and
outlawry that fall somewhere between history and
myth. They are remarkable documents; Milan Kun-
dera, a Czech novelist, once remarked that they would
be rightly considered “an anticipation or even the
foundation of the European novel” if only they had
been written in a language anyone else spoke. 

They came from the land of the ice and snow
Religious works also got recorded on sheepskin parch-
ment. In 1000 a close-run decision at the Alþingi (an
annual parliament) saw the Icelanders trade in Odin
for the Holy Trinity. Fairly soon, theological texts were
being translated into Icelandic; the common tongue
became “a respectable alternative to Latin” centuries
before the Reformation brought a comparable transi-
tion in the rest of Europe, according to Kristján Árna-
son, a linguist at the University of Iceland.
The idea that scholars and clerks needed to take se-
riously the language people actually used was not un-
ique to Iceland. Dante Alighieri, a Tuscan poet, made
the same argument in “De Vulgari Eloquentia”. But he
did so, tellingly, in Latin—and in the early 14th century.
Iceland’s “First Grammatical Treatise”, which explored
ways to write Old Norse using the Latin alphabet, was
written by an unknown hand 150 years earlier. 
The wealth of early vernacular literature and schol-
arship is one reason Icelandic is preserved in its an-
cient form, with a complex grammar other Scandina-
vian languages have lost. (Icelandic has three genders
and four cases, which aﬀect the endings on nouns and 

1

60

Icelandic

adjectives based on their roles in sentences. For the most part the
continental Scandinavian languages have lost a gender and al-
most all of their case systems. Icelandic verbs have six forms for
the six grammatical persons. The others have stripped this down
to one.) Another reason for preservation was straightforward iso-
lation. Iceland is 700km (380 nautical miles) of rough ocean from
the nearest inhabited land, the tiny Faroe Islands—which have
their own grammatically conservative Scandinavian language.
One study of more than 2,000 languages found that those with
few speakers that are spoken in small areas with few neighbours
tend to have precisely the kind of complexities Icelan-
dic and Faroese have retained and Danish has aban-
doned. “Big” languages can keep Icelandic-style intri-
cacy—Russian is one that has done so. But they are the
exception. 
Another factor is that Iceland was unpopulated
when settled. Conquest often leaves “substrate” inﬂu-
ences on the language of those taking charge. And
class was largely irrelevant; the prestigious written language was
spoken by educated and illiterate alike. The result, say many Ice-
landers, is that they can read 13th-century sagas “like a newspa-
per”. Such claims should be taken with a pinch of the island’s
black salt. The grammar may have changed little, but the sagas as-
sume knowledge of kinship ties and myths that modern Iceland-
ers must learn about at school. Many compare the diﬃculty of
reading them to English-speakers’ struggles with Shakespeare. But
that is still extraordinary; the sagas were not written in Shake-
speare’s time. They were written a century before Chaucer.

“She is biding
at home, 
heat-weak and
head-wrought”

To ﬁght the horde, and sing and cry
The stability of Icelandic is a subject for debate and speculation. Its
lexical purity is more easily explained. It has borrowed many
words in its history. But in the 17th century Icelandic intellectuals
began to kick them out. A Danish-Icelandic dictionary shows how
diﬀerent the two cousins have become. Danish has borrowed a
slew of pan-European words: passiv, patent and pedicure appear
on one page. The Icelandic equivalents are hlutlaus, einkaleyﬁ and
fótsnyrting. A huge stock of words with Latin and Greek roots is
shared across almost all European languages, from “telephone” to
“address”. Not so with Icelandic. “Telephone” is sími, from an old
Norse word for “thread”. “Address” is heimilisfang—literally, the
place where one may be caught at home. A foreigner encountering
Icelandic-only signage is usually unable to decipher a single word.
Forbiddingly long compound words like hjúkrunarfræðingur
(nurse) have no familiar elements. (Hjúkrun comes from roots for
“serving” and “caring”, and fræðingur is a specialist) The letters ð
and þ, representing two “th” sounds (the ﬁrst as in “this”, the sec-
ond as in “thin”), add to the exotic feel. 
That said, some words do look similar to English ones: bók, epli
and brauð are “book”, “apple” and “bread”. This is because the
Scandinavian languages, like the west Germanic languages (Eng-
lish, Dutch and German), share a proto-Germanic ancestor. More

overlapping vocabulary comes from the fact that Vi-
king invaders left some words behind in England:
“knife”, “leg”, “husband”, “window” and even “they”
(þeir in both Old Norse and modern Icelandic). 
To English ears, this means that many words, be-
witchingly, are neither as alien as hjúkrun, nor as easy
as bók, but both familiar and not. To be ill is veik, or
“weak”. Something’s price is its verð, or “worth”. To
wait is biða, or “to bide”. A fever is hita, or “heat”. Put
together höfuð, “head”, and verk, cognate to words like
“work” and “wrought”, and you get a headache, hö-
fuðverk. Thus to learn Icelandic feels a little like becom-
ing pre-modern, or entering a fantasy. “She is biding at
home, heat-weak and head-wrought” is the sort of dic-
tion you might imagine for characters in “Game of
Thrones” (ﬁlmed partly in Iceland, as it happens). 
Some of these similarities, though, can mislead. An
English-speaker who knows that dóm is cognate to the
English word “doom” may ﬁnd the Reykjavik building
marked dómsmálaráðuneytid rather menacing. But it is
just the ministry of justice: “doom” in English was
once mere judgment; only later did it take on ﬁrst the
meaning of condemnation, then ruin.
It is not clear in quite what way J.R.R. Tolkien meant
the word when he named the climactic locale in “The
Lord of the Rings” Mount Doom. But as a philologist
interested in Norse and other ancient tongues, and
keen on the archaic, he certainly knew his Icelandic.
The name of the wizard Gandalf is taken from the Ed-
das. The Tolkiens’ Icelandic nanny, Adda, not only
took care of the children; part of her role was to help
him practice Icelandic. Mrs Tolkien was not pleased by
the attention. 
W.H. Auden—a great fan of “The Lord of the Rings”—
was also entranced by Iceland’s stories and language.
He liked the local smoked lamb and dried ﬁsh less, pre-
ferring to live on endless coﬀee and cigarettes during
his stay there in the 1930s. And he disliked some of the
island’s other devotees, too. In a letter to a friend he de-
scribed catching a bus “full of Nazis who talk inces-
santly about Die Schönheit des Islands [the beauty of
Iceland], and the Aryan qualities of the stock.” This is
the downside to a reputation for isolated, undiluted
purity. The country remains the recipient of unwel-
come attention from fascists. David Duke, a former
leader of the Ku Klux Klan, has said that “there’s only
one country anymore that’s all white, and that’s Ice-
land. And Iceland is not enough.” Paul Fontaine, a jour-
nalist at the Reykjavík Grapevine, says that white-su-
premacist comments on the newspaper’s Facebook
page warn Iceland not to “make the same mistakes” as
other countries: letting in asylum-seekers or Muslims.

Guðni in 2003, she soon started learning Icelandic in
earnest. The diﬃculty was that Icelanders, not used to
hearing their language spoken by foreigners, would
switch to English before she got the ﬁrst phrase out.
She learned to say “I’m learning Icelandic” pre-emp-
tively to stop them. Some 14 years later she gives
speeches in the language—but she makes fun of her
own conjugation mistakes as she does so.
Not all new arrivals stay as long. Short-term work-
ers from the EU, like the 2m tourists a year, ﬁnd they
have no need to learn Icelandic. Law requires that
signs primarily for Icelanders be written in Icelandic.
(H&M, a clothing retailer, recently ﬂouted it with a sign
reading “Grand Opening!”). But much of Reykjavik no
longer seems to be “primarily for Icelanders”. 
Technology may pose an even greater threat than
foreigners. Icelanders cannot use Siri on their farsímis
or Alexa at home: Apple and Amazon do not support
the language. An Icelandic engineer at Google con-
vinced the company to add Icelandic speech-recogni-
tion to Android smartphones, a task that required re-
cording thousands of hours of Icelandic and having it
transcribed into text. Google made this data freely
available to others. But how much it will be used is not
clear. Eiríkur Rögnvaldsson of the University of Ice-
land says that while Microsoft Windows added Icelan-
dic fairly early, the translation was bad enough that
many users stuck with English. It was later improved.
But when he recently asked a class of 20-30 native stu-
dents in his Icelandic university course how many
used Windows in Icelandic, not one did.
That it is the language of technology contributes to
a sense among the young that English is cool, practical
and international, while Icelandic is stolid, diﬃcult
and local. When asked, young people repeat their par-
ents’ beliefs about the need to keep the language pure.
But they adore English. In 2017 Stefanie Bade, a Ger-
man doctoral student at the University of Iceland,
found that listening to recordings of their own tongue
spoken with diﬀerent accents, Icelanders rated the lo-
cal accent as the most “attractive” and “relaxed”, but
the American the most “intelligent”, “reliable” and “in-
teresting”. They gave the American accent the most
positive rating overall.
But Icelanders have survived isolation, ice and vol-
canoes for more than a millennium. It will take more
than tourists, foreign workers and Siri to make them
give up on their most treasured cultural inheritance.
Where else in the world could you ﬁnd such an arrest-
ing word for a lucky windfall—hvalreki, a beached
whale that oﬀers months of food? Icelanders will not
make the mistake of treating their lovely language as
such a happy accident. It is an ongoing achievement to
be cherished. It may be something of a living fossil, but
keeping it alive is both their duty and delight. *

This is one reason why Ari Páll Kristinsson, head of the island’s
language planning council, cringes at the idea of linguistic “puri-
ty”, and suggests shyly that one speak simply of the “Icelandic vo-
cabulary tradition”. But he works hard at keeping the language as
close to uncontaminated old Norse as is feasible. Compared to
other countries with the same goal, his team does very well. In
France, an Academy of 40 grey-haired worthies pronounces on
what is and is not proper French and terminology committees in
government ministries busily coin new words. The French, merri-
ly ignorant of most of their pronouncements, continue to liker
posts from Facebook friends and bruncher with their real-world
friends regardless. In Iceland Ari Páll and his staﬀ of three listen to
what the public wants and get listened to in turn. The council has
around 50 unoﬃcial groups of enthusiasts with an interest in lan-
guage as well as subjects such as cars, electrical engineering, com-
puters or knitting. Those committees suggest new words with sol-
id Norse roots, taking in the council’s advice on how to make them
ﬁt the sound and grammar of Icelandic. 
In perhaps their most famous example of purist creativity,
when a word for computer was needed in the 1960s, the planners
coined tölva, combining tala (“number”) and völva, an old word
for prophetess. When doctors started talking about AIDS using the
English acronym rather than its long, literal Icelandic translation,
heilkenni áunnins ónæmisbrests, the committee coined two shor-
ter alternatives: alnæmi, something like “all-susceptibility”, and
eyðni, which sounds like the English term, but comes from the Ice-
landic eyða, meaning “to destroy”. When Icelanders started say-
ing “podcast”, the council quickly responded with hlaðvarp, from
roots meaning “charge” (squint and you can see hlaða as a distant
cousin to “load”) and “throw”. 

Peace and trust can win the day
The country welcomes new people, even as it makes its own new
words. The foreign-born now account for over 10% of the popula-
tion. Many come from eastern Europe (though Iceland is not in the
EU, they don’t need visas) but there are also Thais and Filipinos. In
2004 American racists reacted with particular bile against a
Grapevine cover story featuring a Kenyan woman in Icelandic na-
tional dress. Guðni Jóhannesson, the president (who is also a his-
torian, and a friend of your correspondent), says that Iceland’s
ﬁshing industry might collapse without foreign workers. Iceland
may be the world’s only country with a “Herring Era Museum”
(Síldarminjasafn). But ﬁsh-processing survives largely thanks to
Poles willing to endure harsh factory conditions.
Do these immigrants pose a threat to Icelandic? Not yet, but
worries are growing. Subsidised language lessons are available,
but support is woefully weak, says Nichole Mosty, who was until
recently an American-Icelandic member of the Alþingi. Her own
Icelandic sometimes draws criticism from Icelanders not quite
sure if someone with a foreign lilt can represent them in politics.
It takes grit to get past one’s early struggles with the language.

Oﬀshore ﬁnance

The whistle-
blower’s story

The Economist December 23rd 2017

One man’s ﬁght against the Swiss
banking system

R O R B A S , SW I T Z E R L A N D

WHEN he saw armed men striding towards
him across the underground car park be-
neath his home on January 19th 2011, Rud-
olf Elmer’s ﬁrst thought was that it was a contract kill-
ing. After that brief moment’s panic, he quickly
realised the men, some of whom wore ski masks, were
police. As he and his wife stepped out of their car, Mr
Elmer was taken into custody. The police searched
their house and left with an array of seized devices, in-
cluding his 11-year-old daughter’s laptop and camera.
The arrest came hours after a Zurich court had con-
victed Mr Elmer of breaching Switzerland’s strict bank-
secrecy laws—for leaking client data from Julius Bär, a
bank where he had previously worked—and threaten-
ing a former colleague. The sentence, a SFr7,200
($7,700) ﬁne, was much more lenient than the prosecu-
tion’s demand of 12 months in prison. 
The subterranean arrest opened up another legal
front, related to something very public that Mr Elmer
had done two days before: to publicise his legal battle,
he had held a press conference in London’s Frontline
Club. He spoke there about the damage being caused
by dodgy ﬁnancial goings-on in “secrecy jurisdic-
tions”. The founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, then
appeared at his side, and Mr Elmer handed him two
CDs. This prompted Swiss prosecutors to ﬁle a fresh set
of charges for violating bank secrecy.
It was just the latest development in Mr Elmer’s
long-running stand-oﬀ with the Swiss authorities.
They had brought their ﬁrst case against him in 2005.
He and Wikileaks had connected in 2008; soon afterwards the site
published a ﬁrst batch of Julius Bär client data. The bank respond-
ed by securing an order from an American court to shut Wikileaks
down—the only time it has been ordered oﬄine. That prompted a
wave of international support for the site and contumely for the
bank as an enemy of free speech. The court ruling was quickly re-
versed, partly on ﬁrst-amendment grounds.
In 2016 the American government ﬁled criminal charges
against Julius Bär over its role in helping American clients hide un-
declared money. The bank paid a $547m ﬁne and admitted con-
spiring to shield accounts in sham structures. It is not clear if the
Americans made use of data provided by Mr Elmer.
But he has deﬁnitely played a role in the broader increase in
scrutiny of oﬀshore ﬁnance. His actions encouraged the American
assault on Swiss ﬁnance that began in 2007 and culminated in
criminal charges and hefty ﬁnes. That forced the Swiss govern-
ment to begin stripping away much of the once-iron-clad secrecy
with which the country has, in the past, protected its banks. 
In doing so, Mr Elmer’s case has shown up his country’s dark
side. The Swiss are, by and large, unwilling to get into each other’s
aﬀairs. They oﬀer support to friends and neighbours, they care
about received opinions, but they prize their independence,
sometimes to the extent of being stubborn, even awkward. When
it comes to banking, though, the nation has often shown a defe-
rential willingness to accommodate—one which, since laws intro-
duced in the 1930s made it a centre for oﬀshore ﬁnance, has been
extended to unsavoury characters and ill-gotten gains along with
everyone else. And the smooth, impersonal and lucrative ami-
ability shown on the face Switzerland turns to the world in these
matters has been backed up by a dead-eyed animus towards any
individualist rocking the boats at home. As in other countries that

rely heavily on providing homes for money people do
not want taxed elsewhere, the ﬁnancial establishment
and the courts typically seek to crush those who
threaten them with what can seem like a single will. 
Unlike other bank whistleblowers in Switzerland,
such as Hervé Falciani, who ﬂed to France after expos-
ing tax-dodging through HSBC in 2008 (and has re-
ceived a ﬁve-year sentence in absentia), Mr Elmer in-
sisted on staying even though he did not have
to—Germany oﬀered him witness protection. He has
paid a heavy price, including demonisation, mental ill-
ness and seven months in custody under an archaic
law allowing extended detention for interrogation.
But Mr Elmer has not had the ﬁght knocked out of
him. More than a decade since the ﬁrst case against
him, he is still locking horns with the authorities. He
has had more than 30 encounters with the courts and
endured 48 prosecutorial interrogations. His lawyer,
Ganden Tethong, has 140 ring binders of documents
related to his cases. At least 13 Swiss federal oﬃces have
been involved.
Julius Bär, whose headquarters are in Zurich, is not
a party to any of the cases. The bank has long main-
tained that Mr Elmer was the classic disgruntled ex-
employee, motivated by revenge. It calls the whole af-
fair “unfortunate and very tedious”. 
Mr Elmer was born in 1955 and his early years
seemed to set the stage for an uncontroversial career.
He grew up in a working-class neighbourhood of Zu-
rich. His father was a train conductor. Rudolf was a
keen sportsman; for a brief spell he was goalkeeper at

Cambridge United, an English football team. Later he served in
the Swiss army. He trained in accounting and worked for Credit
Suisse, a bank, and KPMG, an accountancy ﬁrm, before moving to
Julius Bär, where his mother worked as a cleaner for the founding
family. 
In 1994 the bank appointed him as compliance chief to its sub-
sidiary in the Cayman Islands, the Caribbean tax haven through
which it booked much of its global proﬁt. At some point his rela-
tionship with his local boss soured, for reasons that are unclear.
Mr Elmer says he was falsely accused of taking documents and
that colleagues resented his blocking of certain transactions. An
internal report branded him a “critical thinker”; it was not a com-
pliment. The bank asked him to take a lie-detector test. He reacted
angrily. He was sacked in late 2002.
When the bank shipped his possessions on to him it inadver-
tently also sent back-up ﬁles containing account data. Mr Elmer, as
compliance oﬃcer, had been entitled to keep such ﬁles at home.
After contacting the bank and certain clients to say he had poten-
tially incriminating information, he sent the ﬁles to Switzerland’s
tax authorities. They were unable to do anything with them be-
cause the Swiss prohibition on disclosing bank secrets makes no
exception for disclosure to government agencies. It was then, Mr
Elmer says, that he concluded he needed help from abroad, and
began contacting foreign governments, journalists and NGOs.
Over time the stress of ﬁghting the bank began to cloud his
judgment, leading him to do some ill-advised things. He wrote
threatening e-mails to bank staﬀ and a client. He made silent late-
night phone calls to Julius Bär’s general counsel, Christoph Hie-
stand. He even wrote a letter to the NPD, a far-right German group,
oﬀering the client data (but says he never sent it).

No Chancellor
And then there was the Angela Merkel letter. Among the docu-
ments published by Wikileaks was a letter purportedly from the
bank to the German chancellor, asking her to close her oﬀshore ac-
counts. The letter, littered with spelling mistakes, is clearly a fake;
there is no evidence Mrs Merkel had any such accounts. Mr Elmer
wrote it himself. He says he added it to the batch forwarded to Wi-
kileaks as a test, to see if they would ﬁlter material before publish-
ing. Whatever his motive, it undermined his credibility. In 2016 it
led to his conviction for falsifying a document. (He denies other
unstable behaviour attributed to him, including the allegation—
ﬂoated in a court ﬁling by the bank’s lawyers—that he sent a threat-
ening letter to Julius Bär’s New York oﬃce containing white pow-
der and making reference to “9/11”.) He talks candidly now about
his mental fragility at the time. He was diagnosed with PTSD, later
suﬀered a breakdown and was hospitalised. He asked his mother
to lock his two army pistols in her safe, fearful that he might do
something he regretted with them.
“People like Elmer are not always nice, their mo-
tives not always pure. They get agitated...and make
mistakes. But that doesn’t mean they’re not on to
something,” says Mark Pieth, a corruption expert from
Basel University who has provided legal opinions that
support Mr Elmer’s defence. Sol Picciotto of the Tax
Justice Network, an NGO, who also knows Mr Elmer,
applauds him for “taking a principled stand on an im-
portant issue” but accepts he isn’t always easy to deal
with: “He’s understandably totally obsessed by his
case and the treatment he has received, to the point
where he may have over-personalised it.” 
Such reactions are hardly uncommon when a
whistleblower lacks a support network and is put un-
der pressure—and much was heaped on Mr Elmer. He
may have made threats but he also received some nas-
ty ones. One e-mail, later traced to a public internet
terminal, said “Your daughter will be killed if you do
not stop.” He and his family became convinced they

“People like 
Elmer are not
always nice, their
motives not
always pure. 
But that doesn’t
mean they’re not
on to something,” 

were being followed around by men in black cars with
German number-plates.
This was not mere paranoia. When Mr Elmer’s
wife, Heidi, noticed she was being tailed one day in
2005, she called the police. They told her to stop at a
petrol station. The other car followed her there. The
police arrived and questioned its driver, who admit-
ted to working for a private detective ﬁrm. That
sparked a legal complaint which revealed that the
shadowers were employed by Julius Bär. The bank
said it had hired them as a defensive measure after Mr
Elmer made threats. Some of the bank’s top execu-
tives, including its board president, Raymond Bär, suf-
fered the embarrassment of being grilled by a prosecu-
tor. The case ended in 2011 with the two sides agreeing
a settlement of SFr700,000, more than 20 times the
norm for such a case, payable to Mr Elmer’s daughter.
He placed this in a (fully taxed) oﬀshore trust for her. 
He also suﬀered mistreatment at the hands of Zu-
rich’s cantonal prosecutors and courts, which played
fast and loose with the law to nail him. They seemed
indignant at his full-frontal attack on the city’s eco-
nomic bedrock, and were determined to send a mes-
sage to anyone else thinking of leaking data.
At every turn they made life hard for him. They
turned down his requests to supply witnesses. The
prosecutors dragged out the pain, taking ﬁve years to
produce an indictment. The seven months in total that
he spent locked up was highly unusual in a white-col-
lar case. Mrs Elmer was barred from visiting him be-
cause she, too, was under investigation, as a suspected
accomplice (that case was dropped after his release). 
Some charges were built on ﬂimsy evidence. Some
judges could barely hide their scorn. One, Peter Marti,
oﬀering a “personal opinion” from the bench, branded
Mr Elmer a “common criminal”, even as he was acquit-
ted of the secrecy charges—an outburst criticised by
other judges. Mr Marti is aﬃliated with the Swiss Peo-
ple’s Party, the political party most wedded to protect-
ing banking secrecy. Already hostile to Mr Elmer, the
judge may have grown even more so when, during his
reading of his ruling, Mr Elmer sought to wind him up
by requesting a toilet break three times in less than half
an hour.
The Tax Justice Network argues that Switzerland
“corrupted its courts” to teach Mr Elmer a lesson and
discourage would-be whistleblowers, meting out “the
sort of treatment one might expect from a totalitarian
regime”. His eﬀorts to undermine an industry that had
brought great prosperity were viewed by much of Zu-
rich’s judiciary as akin to treason.
The canton’s courts acted “like a holy inquisition”
in dealing with Mr Elmer, says Mr Pieth. “If they
couldn’t prove his guilt on one charge, they’d ﬁnd an-
other one to get him on.” Another academic who was
brought in to oﬀer a legal opinion, Wolfgang Wohlers,
also of Basel University, recalls the prosecution radiat-
ing vengefulness. Why? “Elmer was considered a Nest-
beschmutzer”—one who fouls his own nest.
The prosecutors have staunchly defended their ap-
proach in the past, but declined to comment for this ar-
ticle because the case is under appeal. Many legal ex-
perts and politicians believe government lawyers
mishandled the case. “The way they went after him
was ridiculous,” says one government oﬃcial, adding
that the Switzerland of today is diﬀerent. It has accept-
ed the need for more transparency and signed up to an
OECD-led standard for exchanging account informa-

claims that the data Mr Elmer exposed were of poor
quality and have led to few if any criminal cases.
That is hard to know; governments don’t reveal the
sources of their investigations. Information provided
by Mr Elmer probably was not as useful as that dished
up by HSBC’s Mr Falciani, or by Bradley Birkenfeld,
whose revelations about Americans’ use of UBS to
stash untaxed money originally set oﬀ America’s as-
sault on Swiss ﬁnance. But Mr Elmer’s ﬁles certainly
shed fresh light on dubious trusts and banks’ question-
able handling of “politically exposed” clients. 
As for his motives, he may initially have just been
angry about being ﬁred. But over time his battle turned
into more of a moral crusade. Such a conversion is not
unusual. Mr Birkenfeld, who now speaks out against
the economic damage done by oﬀshore malfeasance,
spilled the beans because he discovered by chance
that his superiors had drawn up documents that left
managers like himself exposed to prosecution while
covering their own backs. He acted to get them before
they got him.
Mr Birkenfeld received a $104m whistleblower
award from America’s Internal Revenue Service after
serving 31 months in prison. Mr Elmer has now ap-
plied to the American government for such an award,
having previously chosen not to. He is doing it in order
to stave oﬀ personal bankruptcy, he says. Zurich’s
courts have ordered him to pay most of the costs of his
case, amounting to some SFr300,000. He says he can-
not pay. 
When will the legal wrangling end? Both sides
have appealed to Switzerland’s Supreme Court
against the most recent ruling. It could drag on for
years. Part of Mr Elmer seems content with that. He
revels in his gadﬂy status and has developed a taste for
litigating. He has ﬁled around 60 legal complaints of
his own—against the bank, its top lawyer Mr Hiestand,
judges and journalists, including Mr Baur. He is taking
a defamation complaint against Judge Marti to the
European Court of Human Rights. “I’m tired of it all, to
be honest,” says Mrs Elmer. “But Ruedi’s not one to
give in.”
He has time for such pursuits. Prosecutors’ eﬀorts to
have him banned from banking failed, but he would
struggle to ﬁnd work in his old profession; the Elmers
rely on Mrs Elmer’s work as a secretary for their mod-
est income. He has dabbled in politics, standing unsuc-
cessfully on the left-wing Alternative List ticket in can-
tonal elections in 2015. There may yet be more whistles
to blow: if the Supreme Court upholds his acquittal on
the secrecy charges, he may release more data. He says
he has made only 5% of his cache public. 
The saga has taken its toll. Years of negative press
have pushed friends and family away, including Mr El-
mer’s siblings. “Our social life is very limited,” shrugs
Mrs Elmer. But Mr Elmer, now 62, is quite jolly. And he
is less viliﬁed than he once was. International disap-
proval and the global ﬁnancial crisis have left the
Swiss less defensive of their banks. The media, once al-
most universally hostile towards Mr Elmer, are now
split down the middle. “Things have moved our way,”
says Mrs Elmer. Inside Paradeplatz, an online newspa-
per with a knack for capturing the ﬁnancial zeitgeist,
describes Mr Elmer as the most underrated opponent
the banks have ever faced. Gian Trepp, a journalist
who has long championed his cause, says: “Ruedi is
stubborn, single-minded. He’s like an old peasant.
One hundred percent Swiss.” *

2 tion with other countries’ tax authorities from 2018. 
However, a proposal that banks be required to check all clients’
tax compliance has been dropped. The Swiss are instead likely to
implement a “zebra” strategy—part white money, part black. This
would entail exchanging account data with other rich countries
but not with many of the African, Asian and Latin American states
that are the source of much of the world’s illicit wealth. The Swiss
have good reasons to worry about some of these countries’ data-
protection standards, but campaigners fear concerns will be exag-
gerated to avoid exchanging information.
Meanwhile, Switzerland’s treatment of whistleblowers re-
mains shoddy—and, unlike in most developed countries, risks get-
ting worse. It oﬀers no legal protections at all to private-sector
whistleblowers, and none are in sight. The penalties for breaching
ﬁnancial secrecy have increased since Mr Elmer was ﬁrst arrested.
A whistleblower who sells data now faces up to ﬁve years in pri-
son. Switzerland is almost alone in refusing to help other coun-
tries if their ﬁnancial-crime investigations rely on stolen data.

Outside the law
As rough a ride as Mr Elmer has had, legally speaking it could have
been worse. Last year the higher court of Zurich found him guilty
of making a threat as well as doctoring the Merkel letter, but ac-
quitted him of all of the more serious charges related to violating
bank secrecy. He received a 14-month suspended sentence. 
It was shrewd tactics on the part of Ms Tethong, Mr Elmer’s law-
yer, that won him the bank-secrecy acquittal. He had wanted to fo-
cus his defence on public-interest arguments. She instead turned
the legal tables by arguing that he had not violated Swiss secrecy
laws. His employment contract was not with a Swiss bank but
with a Cayman trust company. Mr Elmer chuckles at the irony: the
very reason for banks like Julius Bär to create independent subsid-
iaries in places like Cayman is to be outside Swiss law, thereby en-
abling clients to avoid tax and other regulatory requirements in
Switzerland and their home countries.
Mr Elmer still has critics. Alex Baur, a journalist with Die Welt-
woche, a Zurich-based magazine, dismisses him as “a simple
blackmailer”, motivated by revenge and money. Mr Baur also

A tiger’s tale

One big cat, ﬁve elephants, 70 men
and a month-long chase across India

D E L H I A N D P A N N A

T HE tiger padded south. Slipping through the grey-green teak
forest he wound around thickets of wild sage, cloaked be-
hind its orange ﬂowers. Gorges in the ruddy sandstone of
the Vindhya plateau gave him respite from the midday heat. By
evening, he had reached the banks of the Ken river, still swollen
with monsoon rains. The forestry workers tracking his radio collar
thought he would stop there. But he plunged in, swimming the
Ken’s 400-metre span and carrying on south, leaving the Panna ti-
ger reserve behind him. 
Panna’s forest guards gave chase, crammed into Bolero jeeps,
rattling yet indestructible. Behind them came colleagues on
mighty tusker elephants. Their aim was not to capture the tiger; to
do so would have meant a tranquilliser dart and, since the tiger
had been sedated twice already in recent months, that would
have been risky. Instead they sought to drive him back into the re-
serve. They used walls of ﬁre set through the forest and great
spools of plastic sheeting. They recruited entire villages to bang
drums and sing songs. A tiger on the loose was, after all, a matter of
life or death—for the tiger. Any Indian tiger outside a reserve runs a
high risk of being poisoned, electrocuted or shot. And this one,
though known only and rather impersonally as T3, was special.
India used to have a lot of tigers. Estimates put their numbers at
the beginning of the 20th century at about 20,000. By 1972 just
1,800 remained. Their decline coincided with a near doubling of
India’s human population, from 238m in 1900 to 554m in 1970. For-
ests where tigers had lived were cut down and converted to farm-
land. The animals which had been the tiger’s prey were hunted to
meet people’s needs—as were the tigers, when they discommoded

people, or when there was money to be made from
pelts or other parts. 
It was an extinction in progress, and in 1973 Indira
Gandhi, the prime minister, decided to do something
about it. The government started Project Tiger, which
aimed to preserve tigers in their natural habitat. Nine
national parks were converted into reserves, covering
more than 16,000 square kilometres. The areas were
“inviolate”, said Ms Gandhi. They were just for tigers,
with all other human activity excluded. Villagers
could no longer graze livestock or gather wood there.
Guards were employed to enforce the new exclusions. 
Today, Project Tiger comprises 50 such reserves cov-
ering some 70,000 square kilometres, which is a bit
more than the size of the Republic of Ireland or West
Virginia, though only just over two per cent of the area
of India. The total population living within these for-
tresses is now about 2,000. To have maintained the
country’s tiger population over four decades during
which the human population more than doubled
again is a signiﬁcant achievement. But the limits to the
approach are becoming ever more apparent. 
This is partly because the reserves, especially the
smaller ones, are such imperfect havens. Take Panna,
the reserve T3 (pictured) walked out of, a 540-square-
kilometre patch of tropical dry forest some 600km
south-east of Delhi, in the state of Madhya Pradesh.

parched cow dung, acrid but pleasant, and the sickly-
sweet spice of chai, cooked on an open ﬁre. Every mo-
ment in this human landscape was a risk. A villager
might see and shoot him. If a farmer found an animal
T3 had killed, he might add poison to its ﬂesh—thus en-
suring the tiger’s death when he returned to the kill for
another meal.
On his tail, desperate to help him, was Rangaiah
Sreenivasa Murthy, the Panna reserve’s ﬁeld director.
He had been put in charge just a few months before, in
May, to oversee the restoration of the park’s tiger pop-
ulation. From the start, Mr Murthy ruled his reserve
with a balance of authoritarianism and kindness.
Workers remarked on the willingness he showed to sit
with them for meals, a breach of caste they took as a
sign of support and respect. At the other end of the so-
cial scale Lokandra Singh, a member of the local royal
family, proclaimed him the “ﬁnest forest worker in In-
dia”. But though in general Mr Murthy is jovial, his
sharp temper prompts rapid, angry ejaculations in
Hindi when he is disappointed—especially if the dis-
appointment has anything to do with his tigers. This
happens with some regularity; no one is as obsessive
about Panna’s tigers as Mr Murthy. 
By the time T3 left the park, Mr Murthy had built up
enough goodwill that Panna’s entire staﬀ rose up and

pert who studies the reserve, says that for a population
resilient enough to bounce back from expected levels
of poaching you need at least 14 breeding females. (The
number of males in a healthy population will vary, but
it is smaller; one male’s territory can cover that of
many tigresses.) But Panna only has room for six, may-
be eight, breeding females. That leaves no margin for
error; the loss of one or two can doom the whole pop-
ulation. With the market for tiger parts in Chinese tra-
ditional medicine a constant source of demand, tigers in such
small numbers depend entirely on their human protectors for
their continued existence. 
In Panna the protectors left something to be desired. In his
book “Non-Stop India” Mark Tully, who for decades was the BBC’s
Delhi correspondent, describes the techniques used to kill Panna
tigers in the early 2000s. Poachers would trap the beasts in snares,
then beat them to death using sticks. If the tiger made too much
noise, a poacher told him, they would shove the end of sticks into
its mouth, followed by clods of earth. For this they got up to
400,000 rupees ($6,200) per animal, a fortune in rural India. 
In 2004 Mr Chundawat warned Panna’s oﬃcials that the num-
ber of tigers had dropped too low; without fresh recruits, the pop-
ulation would disappear. His warnings were dismissed as activist
hype. Rajesh Gopal, then the director of Project Tiger, accused him
of having a “hidden agenda”, and claimed that his reports
amounted to “media breast-beating”. It would take four more
years for the oﬃcials to face the fact that Mr Chunda-
wat had been right. In early 2009, they admitted that
their fortress had failed. Panna was not the home to 35
tigers it had claimed to be. It contained just a single
male who had drifted in from elsewhere. At least it
seemed to: because he was uncollared the authorities
didn’t actually know where he was. To save Panna,
new females would have to be brought in, and they
duly were. But by the time they got there, the male in-
terloper had apparently moved on. 
Panna needed its own resident male. A strapping
ﬁve-year-old in the Pench reserve, 650km to the south,
emerged as the prime candidate. So on November 6th
2009, T3 was shot with a tranquilliser dart, loaded on
to a lorry, and taken to Panna. It was not so diﬀerent
from his home. It had rocks to lounge on, game to hunt,
streams to ripple his thick fur when he dunked himself
in them. But T3 did not like it there. So he started walk-
ing home. 

To herd a cat
T3 crossed the Ken on November 26th. He skirted Pa-
tori, a village on Panna’s scraggy verge, before ﬁnding a
seam of forest snaking along under the lee of a sand-
stone ridge. He followed it up the gentle slope of the
Vindhya plateau. 
The forests of Madhya Pradesh are mostly teak, but
in scrubbier areas closer to villages the hardwood
gives way to eucalyptus and Coromandel ebony, its
leaves used to wrap the local cigarettes, known as
beedi. There are white-barked ghost trees that gleam in
the sun, mangoes, acacias, and the mahua tree, its
ﬂowers beloved by elephants and humans alike. Wild
sage, or Lantana, an invasive species from the Ameri-
cas, ﬁlls every available cranny in thick bunches. The
air smells of baked earth, and is ﬁlled with the noise of
songbirds hidden in the canopy. Kingﬁshers streak
over the streams, their paths traced on the retina in
time-lapse turquoise. 
When T3 had to leave the cover of the forest, he
padded through ﬁelds of lentils and sesame, chickpeas
and mustard. Here the scents are more domestic:

gave chase at his command. Their numbers were
boosted by villagers paid 250 rupees a day for their ser-
vices helping the team navigate unfamiliar landscapes
(an outlay which also helped to reduce the risk of
shooting or poisoning). A roiling retinue of guards and
villagers, elephants and jeeps spread out across the
countryside. Walk into any of the tiny villages Mr Mur-
thy’s men passed through in the weeks that followed
and at least a handful of villagers will know his name.
It is unusual fame for a forestry oﬃcer. 
This retinue moved in two diﬀerent modes: search
and chase. T3’s radio collar had a battery life of several
years, but a range of just a dozen kilometres. When the
park workers couldn’t pick up its signal, jeeps were dis-
patched with hand-held antennae to hurtle up and
down the red-dirt back roads. (At one point, Mr Mur-
thy had road-building machines brought in to lay
down better surfaces for the tired Boleros.) When a
ranger on top of an old water tower or on the peak of a
small hill picked something up, the location would be
relayed back to camp, passing from jeep to jeep
through on-board radios until it reached Mr Murthy.
The order for pursuit would be given, and the lumber-
ing caravan of men, jeeps and elephants would gather
itself up and return to the chase.
Sometimes the signal would vanish; sometimes the tiger
would appear. Two days after T3 left the park, when he was still
close by, Mr Murthy’s troupe tracked his signal down to a stretch of
dense forest near the village of Matipura. As darkness gathered
they formed a two-kilometre line of men, cars, elephants and ﬁre
along a rough track that ran north-south across the tiger’s path. The
headlights faced east, beaming back towards Panna. Fires were lit
every 20 metres. Hundreds of villagers joined the line, gathering
around the ﬂames to stay warm, beating drums, playing music
and singing. Rambahadur, Panna’s biggest tusker, plunged into the
jungle, guards and a local villager on his back, aiming to drive the
tiger out. He went the other way; a ﬂash of orange slipped be-
tween two cars and disappeared back into the forest heading
west. By the time they had raised the alarm, he was gone.
On another occasion Deo Singh, who lives in Ghoghara, a vil-
lage on the ridge T3 followed, was sitting on Rambahadur, acting
as guide to a forest guard, when the elephant pushed over some
debris to reveal T3. Mr Singh says he remembers how big the tiger
was and that it had stripes on its chest “like swords”. Directed by
his mahout, Rambahadur started to whack the cat with its trunk in
an attempt to shoo it back towards the reserve. But, again, the tiger
slipped away.

A self-willed world
At Nagda, a village down the road from Ghoghara, an old man on
a Zimmer frame (an unusually advanced walking aid for rural Ma-
dhya Pradesh) was less impressed by T3. He says he remembers
the times when the ridge was often used by what he calls, in Hindi,
“jungley tigers”. The villagers would see the wild beasts’ paw
prints and hear their roars. With his radio collar and lagging entou-
rage of humans, jeeps and elephants, the man said he thought T3
was distinctly domesticated. 
He has a point. Life in a well-protected tiger reserve
is hardly wild, despite the idea that they provide a nat-
ural habitat. Corbett, India’s oldest reserve, is dotted
with over 200 camera traps. The Wildlife Institute of
India has experimented with drones. Pregnant fe-
males inside parks are under constant monitoring. “Ti-
ger habitats are controlled and manipulated by hu-
mans,” says Valmik Thapar, a well-known tiger
conservationist in Delhi. There are no fences, for the
most part. But some are arguing for them, saying they
would better protect the tigers. 

Mr Singh says he
remembers how
big the tiger was,
and that it had
stripes on its
chest “like
swords”

An exclusion of the human that relies entirely on
omniscient human enforcers makes the reserves odd-
ly artiﬁcial: they are absolutely natural in what they
contain, absolutely unnatural in their conception. It
also makes the tigers’ situation precarious. Their pro-
tection is handled by local forest departments, which
often lack wildlife expertise; if the local department is
not led by someone who cares about tigers, their pro-
tection suﬀers. And excluding all humans from re-
serves creates tension with local villagers, who often
want to graze their animals or forage for ﬁrewood—a
problem with nature reserves around the world that is
keenly felt in India.
New ideas are emerging of how to replace the for-
tress approach. Mr Chundawat says Indian conserva-
tion should focus on fostering “satellite habitats”
around the primary reserves—patches of forest big
enough for two or three breeding females which
would not require as much protection as a fully
ﬂedged reserve. The satellites would oﬀer refuge to ti-
gers which, like T3, lit out for the territories; they
would function as a backup to the primary reserves.
Mr Chundawat envisions, in time, a network of tiger
populations that are more integrated with the humans
who live next door.
In this vision, the arrival of a wandering tiger be-
comes a positive event for villagers, an opportunity to
oﬀer tourists homestays, or put on small-scale safaris.
Getting local people to embrace this, though, will be
something of a challenge. In rural Madhya Pradesh of-
ﬁcial literacy rates are around 65%, while real rates are
often far lower. That makes it diﬃcult to start tourist
enterprises which take advantage of possible tigers.
Mr Chundawat optimistically suggests starting small,
tapping into local knowledge to encourage tourism
based on bird-watching and wilderness retreats, for in-
stance. If a tiger comes by it will be a welcome bonus,
not an unwanted new neighbour. Such approaches
have been making headway in parts of Africa.
You can see something like this in operation on the
fringes of Ranthambore, a reserve in Rajasthan. An
outﬁt called Tiger Watch sends camera-trap photos to
the phones of local volunteers. They keep watch on

2 the tigers as part of their normal lives—a more relaxed and more
sustainable form of tracking than Panna’s maximum-security sur-
veillance. It also leaves the door open for those villagers to build
businesses based on their local tigers.

The wanderer returns
The villagers T3 came across were not yet ready to be welcoming.
On December 20th a farmer from the village of Ramna, about
200km from Panna and 300km from Pench—almost halfway
home!—was heading out to work in a ﬁeld of ripe sugar cane when
he came upon the tiger lurking in lush shadow. Word reached Mr
Murthy’s troupe quickly, but by the time he arrived the villagers
were scared and angry about the tiger’s presence. Some enterpris-
ing locals declared that, since the tiger had settled in their ﬁeld, it
now belonged to them. Mr Murthy was having none of it. He
asked the value of the ﬁeld, then bought it on the spot, handing
over a wodge of rupees. Fires were lit; Rahmbadhur crashed into
what was now government sugar cane. Again T3 was ﬂushed out;
again he quickly disappeared back into the forest. 
The men started to ask Mr Murthy what more they could do
when all their best eﬀorts had come to nothing. T3 was intent on
travelling south, and there seemed nothing anyone could do to
stop him. Mr Murthy called Delhi and asked whether the tiger
might be returned to Pench, as he clearly wanted. They refused:
Panna was getting T3 or it was not getting a male tiger at all. So Mr
Murthy was left with no alternative but the tranquilliser dart. On
Christmas Day T3 was shot next to a small pond. The sleeping tiger
(pictured on the previous page) was trucked north to Panna. His
winding 450km-journey remains the only documented case of an
apparent homing instinct in a wild tiger. 
His return saved Panna. Soon he met T1, a female brought in
from another reserve. By April, she had borne a litter. Today
Panna’s population is back up to 35 or so; younger tigers have start-
ed leaving the park, looking for more space. T3, now a great-grand-
father, has settled down. 
But Panna’s success was won only by becoming ever more of a
fortress. Mr Murthy built 11 watchtowers across the park, from
which guards look out for the splotches of red light that poachers

use to attract animals at night. Each breeding female
wears a radio collar and is monitored around the
clock. When a pond went dry a few years back, Mr
Murthy installed water tanks to ﬁll it back up. Some say
this drove one of the tigresses away, leaving her aban-
doned cubs to die. Mr Murthy says he had to take ex-
treme measures to pull Panna back from the brink.
“What Murthy did, only Murthy could do,” says Mr
Chundawat.
Now, though, Mr Murthy has gone on to a job in
Bhopal, the state capital. The new boss, Vivek Jain,
takes a less direct interest in tigers. Panna remains both
fortiﬁed and fragile. India’s human population is still
growing, the trade in tiger parts persists. The long-term
survival of tigers lies in aligning their interests with an
improvement of local people’s lives—of being a sight
people believe is worth seeing, and which people will
come to look at when they can.
For such magniﬁcence to depend for its future on
being instagrammable seems to oﬀend against dignity.
But what else is there? The obsessively monitored for-
tresses cannot last forever, and they are hardly the nat-
ural habitats they were once believed to be. There will
always be wildness in the ways of animals—in what
they choose, unbidden, to pursue. But to seek the natu-
ral, in India as elsewhere, must also be to accept that
the world of the wild is shared with, and shaped by,
humans; to be a human who loves nature is to try and
make that sharing work. The idea of powerful crea-
tures in the vast untouched wilderness has a sublime
thrill to it. It also has a certain cosiness; it is the imagi-
nary ideal where many human ideas about nature
grew up. But as T3 discovered after he swam across the
Ken, you really can’t go home again. “The old world is
gone,” says Mr Thapar. “We cannot bring it back.” *

Commodities

The Economist December 23rd 2017

The world in
a barrel

Crude oil is the most traded 
commodity in the world. What is it
made of and where does it go?

I N 2016 the world consumed 96m bar-
rels of oil every day. They all started out
as algae or plankton, with the odd di-
nosaur thrown in for good measure. Dead
and buried, this ancient life was trans-
formed into a suite of molecules made up
of chains and rings of carbon with hydro-
gen stuck to them, and thus, prosaically
known, as hydrocarbons. (They have some
sulphur in them, too; it’s a pain.)
Hydrocarbons, which sometimes seep
to the surface unbidden, have been used
for millennia. They can be set alight to
frighten your enemy’s cavalry, or slathered
into the seams between the planks of your
ship’s hull. Today they power a global
economy and can be used to make almost
anything.
Using oxygen to burn up hydrocarbons
liberates lots of energy. It also creates wa-
ter, which doesn’t matter much, and car-
bon dioxide, which does. Oil accounts for
35% of industrial CO2 emissions. 
Diﬀerent hydrocarbons are used to fuel
diﬀerent things. The shorter the carbon
chain, the more easily a fuel is vapourised,
and in turn burned. A little molecule like
butane—four carbons long—is good for a
cigarette lighter; a ship’s engine may use
something 10 times longer.
Every barrel of crude oil contains a mix
of all these molecules. Reﬁneries sort them
out, exploiting the fact that they vapourise
at diﬀerent temperatures to separate them
by distillation. But even “light” crude—the
short-chain-rich sort
the industry likes
best—contains more of the long chains
than anyone needs. So reﬁners use clever
chemistry (“ﬂuid catalytic cracking”) and
brute-force heat (“coking”) to break some
long molecules into shorter ones. 
Distillation and cracking also produce
plenty of small molecules containing just
two or three carbons; these form the basis
for the petrochemical industry, which uses
them either for their own properties or as
the building blocks for all manner of plas-
tics, ﬁbres and pharmaceuticals. The glo-
bal market for these is some $680bn: more
than a third as big as the $1.6trn oil market.
All this takes a lot of energy: most reﬁn-
eries use between ﬁve and ten percent of
the energy in the crude that passes through
them. In years to come that might change.
Practitioners of “synthetic biology” are
learning to genetically engineer microbes
that can synthesise the building blocks of
petrochemicals—and indeed the chemi-
cals themselves. In the future, the reﬁnery
may well fall prey to the descendants of its
long-dead reason for being: algae. *

Sweet and sour

There is no such thing as an average barrel of 
crude: what emerges might be thick, black and 
gloopy or thin and yellow. In all cases it is a rich 
cocktail of hydrocarbons. These molecules may 
have lots of sulphur (sour, to the taste buds of 
early oil prospectors), or little (sweet). Sulphur 
can be useful–for instance, in fertilisers–but is 
energy-intensive to separate.

Nowhere does a barrel of oil represent a mixture 
of exactly what the local market demands: even 
in light crude, there is too high a fraction of 
heavier, lower-value molecules. Refining is 
therefore not just separating what comes out of 
the ground, but also breaking those big 
molecules into smaller, more-useful ones.

The distillation process The first step is simply to heat the 
crude oil. Smaller molecules boil at a lower temperature 
than larger ones, so atmospheric and vacuum distillation
(at normal and reduced pressures, respectively) separate 
these components.

Ethylene / Propylene

Liquef ied petroleum gas (LPG) 

Petrochemicals Cracking and distilling produce 
some small molecules too valuable to burn. 
Ethylene and propylene can be carefully 
assembled into repeating chains of any length. 
Polyethylene is the world’s most common 
plastic; butadiene is the starting point for 
synthetic rubber.

Butadiene

Pharmaceuticals Aromatics and other 
petrochemicals are used and combined to 
form drugs. Benzene, for example, gives rise to 
chemicals used to make aspirin and penicillin.

Aromatics These ring-shaped molecules 
end up in many household chemicals such 
as paint thinner. Aromatics are also the basis
of lots of familiar materials, from nylon 
toothbrush bristles to polyurethane 
sofa cushions.

Gasoline

Gasoline Perhaps the most finely tuned 
product to exit refineries, gasoline is actually 
made up of the output of many different 
processes. It is subject to strict requirements 
of “octane”—not actually a measure of 
eight-carbon octane molecules but rather
     combustion properties corresponding

It is sold cheaply into the coal market.

Sulphur

Sulphur atoms in hydrocarbons create oxides when burned 
(“SOx”) which are harmful to health. So at almost every stage 
of refining there are steps to remove some sulphur. Since the 1990s, 
the allowed sulphur content in diesel has dropped from 5,000 parts 
per million to just 15. The sulphur is sold to sulphate-fertiliser 
manufacturers among others.

Asphalt/

Bitumen The tarry stuff on roads and roofs, and 
probably also the first component of crude oil 
to be identified as useful. The Sumerians, 
Assyrians and Babylonians all used 
it to waterproof their ships.

TheUgandan nation wasthrown togetherfrom a jumble ofpre-colonial kingdomsand decentralised societies. Traditional in-stitutionswere abolished afterindepen-dence.

The danger, asJan-WernerMüller, a professoratPrinceton, haswritten, isthat“the EUcomesacrossasimperialistin aspiration and impotentin practice.” Woj-ciech Przybylski, editorofVisegrad Insight,a Warsaw-based jour-nal, notesthatArticle 7 also placesPoland’sopposition in a bind:backthe government, orside with foreign interestsagainst it?Aware ofthe limitsoftheirtools, politiciansoutside Polandhave pinned theirhopeson otherthings: Polish civil society, a runon sovereign bondstriggered byPiS’sproﬂigacy, the political op-position and, mostrecently, MrKaczynski’sappointmentofMa-teuszMorawiecki, the brainy, English-speakingﬁnance minister,asprime minister.

In three months the Conservatives’ share in the polls fell by 22percentage points. It took voters ﬁve months to turn so strongly against John Major,and eight months to grow so weary of Gordon Brown. But whereas those two leaderseventually fell further, Mrs May seems to have pulled out of her nosedive. Faced with thealternative of Jeremy Corbyn, voters may reckon they can live with her. Another year ofBrexit talks—the next one much harder than the last—may yet make them think again.Top of the ﬂopsITISunusual to hearapplause ata Euro-pean Union summit.

And on December19th theprime ministercalled a full cabinetmeet-ingto discuss, forthe ﬁrsttime, exactlywhattrade deal to askfor.Astheybelatedlystartthisdebate, min-istersmustface several unpalatable trade-oﬀs. Anytransition period will have to beon the EU’sterms, meaningacceptance ofall itsrules, includingfree movement ofpeople. And because the Article 50 divorcewill be given treatyforce before a newtrade agreementcan be struck, Britain’sexitbill ofaround £40bn ($54bn) cannotbeused asleverage to secure a betterdeal, assome ministersonce hoped. Butthe tricki-esttrade-oﬀsofall concern the precisetermsofthe future trade relationship. AsGermany’sAngela Merkel remarked inBrussels, thiswill be the toughestpart ofthe negotiations.The summitconclusionscalled forgreaterclarityfrom Britain overwhat itwanted forthe future trade relationship.Some diplomatsnowexpectMrsMaytomake a bigspeech on thisearlyin the newyear. ButEUnegotiatorsare emphaticaboutthe limitsto whattheywill oﬀer her.IfMrsMaysticksto herinsistence that Brit-ain mustleave both the single market andthe customsunion, and wantsto divergefrom EUregulations, she will onlybe ableto have a trade deal similarto Canada’s,which coversmostgoodsbutbarelyanyservices. Ifshe wantsbettertermsthanthis, she will have to acceptsingle-marketrules, justasNorwaydoes.Asone British oﬃcial putsit, Brussels isproposingCanada, while Britain wantscake. The bigquestion iswhetherMrs Maycan secure a deal somewhere betweenNorway’sand Canada’s. Helpfully, a pairofnewreportshave justbeen published bythe Institute forGovernmentand the Insti-tute forPublicPolicyResearch, two Lon-don-based think-tanks. Both supportcloseregulatoryalignment, and add thatany di-vergence thatmaybe possible can comeonlyatthe price ofreduced accessto thesingle market. Buteven so theyoﬀer hopeofsome middle way. The IFGpapertalks ofa“regulatorypartnership model”; the IPPRproposesa new“shared market”.Yetforall the ingenuityofthese ideas,there are fewsignsofﬂexibilityfrom Brus-sels. Michel Barnier, the chiefEUnegotia-tor, repeated thisweekthatBritain couldnothave a bespoke deal thatgave itthesubstantial beneﬁtsofNorwaywith thelightobligationsofCanada. Experience inthe ﬁrstphase ofthe Brexittalksshows thatthe EUhasmostofthe bargainingpower.And there are legal constraints: ifthe EUof-fered Britain a more generousdeal thanCanada’s, itwould be obliged bythe condi-tionsofearlierdealsto give the same termsto several countries, includingCanada.Then there isthe issue ofthe Irish bor-der. MrsMayonce again promised herfel-lowEUleadersthatthere would be nohard borderwith physical infrastructureafterBrexit. The Article 50 deal speciﬁesthat, unlesssome othersolution isfound,Britain promisesto maintain “full align-ment” with mostEUregulations.

Campaignersmustdefeatvested interests, incomprehensionand ridicule. Cristina Bicchieri, a philoso-pheratthe UniversityofPennsylvania andthe authorof“Normsin the Wild”, a bookaboutsocial rules, hasa warning: “Don’texpectthe birth ofa newnorm to be easy.” From the topWith hindsight, thisyear’sﬂood ofallega-tionshad itssource in 2016. DuringDonaldTrump’spresidential campaign, a soundrecordingrevealed him boastingofserialharassmentand groping.

Sincethen dozensofprominentmen in showbusiness, journalism and politicshavebeen accused ofsexual harassment, andbeen sacked orstepped down. The #Me-Too hashtaghasalreadybeen used 4.7mtimeson Twitterbywomen (and a fewmen) whose harasserswere notfamousenough to make the news. Both sexeshave found the outpouringastonishing. Manymen are amazed tolearn thatso manywomen have suﬀeredsexual harassment. Forwomen the sur-prise isthatperpetratorsare beingpun-ished atlast. Norms underconstructionSocial change often startswith a grassrootsmovement. Itcan promote newwaysofthinking, orreveal injusticesthathad longbeen ignored. Newbehavioural rulesmayfollow. Butifthese emergingnormsare notembraced bybigpartsofthe population,theywill notbecome entrenched. And iftransgressionsare seen to go unremarkedorunpunished, theywill continue.Progressisoften halting. Until the pastfewyears, when same-sexmarriage be-came lawin dozensofcountries, gay-rightscampaignerssuﬀered a stringofdefeats.Progresscan also be incomplete. The pasthalf-centuryhasseen the criminalisationofrape within marriage and tougherlawsagainstdomesticviolence. However, bothcrimesare still common, and rarelypun-ished. Some massmovementsend in fail-ure. America’stemperance campaignersachieved Prohibition in 1920. Just13 yearslaterthe barscame outofhidingand werebackin business.MsBicchieri emphasiseshowexcep-tional people often getthe processstarted.Theymaybe braverthan the average per-son, ormore motivated—orhave lesstolose. Ifthere are enough ofthem, the trendcan accelerate, because each newfollowermakesiteasierforthe next.Duringthe 1950sthe numberofblackstudentson American campusesin-creased bya third. Studentswere central tothe successofthe civil-rightsmovement astheycould go on marchesorstage sit-inswithoutbeingsacked. In the 1970ssomebattered wives, ﬁred up bysecond-wavefeminism, lefttheirhusbandsand set uprefuges, makingiteasierforotherabusedwomen to join them. The AIDSepidemicofthe 1980sgalvanised gaymen who hadlostloved onesto come out. The ﬁght fortreatmentforged a disciplined movementthatwon the battle forsame-sexmarriagethree decadeslater. Asa trend builds, so doespublic aware-ness. Even defeatscan keep campaigners’demandsin the publiceye. When civil-rightsmarcherswere arrested and beaten,itbecame harderto ignore discriminationagainstblackpeople. Abused women inrefugeswere more visible than those athome, boostingsupportforstricterlawsagainstdomesticviolence. Asfriends, col-leagues, uncles, aunts, brothersand sisterscame out, the straightmajoritywascon-fronted bythe factthatgayswere notfreaks. The share ofAmericanswho sup-ported gaymarriage grewfrom little over aquarterin 1996 to a majorityin 2011. Lookingback, itcan be startling to seehowblind people were to injusticesthatwere keptprivate bycustom. Domestic vi-olence used to be a familymatter. Doctorsthoughtitwasrare, and thatvictims hadpsychological problems. The Journal ofMarriage and Family, founded in 1939, hadno entryforviolence in itsindexfor itsﬁrst30 years. Itisnowwidelyaccepted thatone ofthe mostdangerousplacesforwom-en and children isthe home.Forsexual harassment, thisprocess ofgeneral enlightenmentiswell underway.Each newwoman who sharesherstory,and each perpetratorwho loseshisjob, in-spiresmore women to come forward andmore ﬁrmsto revisitallegationsthey hadlongignored.Once a newidea isin the air, it can catchon, oritcan fade away. Ifitisto survive,societyneedsto form a new“normativeexpectation”, a shared beliefabouthow tobehave. Thisisa delicate moment. Shininga lighton bad behaviourmayhave unintended consequences. Cam-paignersagainstdate rape on universitycampuses, forexample, musttake care thatrevealinghowmanywomen have beenvictimsdoesnotlead some men to con-clude that, ifdate rape isreallyso common,itcannotbe particularlyserious. Alterna-tively, bystandersmayconclude the pro-blem isbeingexaggerated orexploited tomake a political point—asa Democraticployto harm MrTrump, forexample. It isworth explainingthata fewproliﬁcmencan leave manyvictims.Orthe newwayofthinkingmayspreadwithin certain groups, butfail to convincethe publicatlarge. The emergingnorm willthen be enforced patchily, ifatall. Fewpeo-ple will intervene to stop an actthey thinkshould notmeritsanction. Theymayevengo asfarashelpingtransgressorsto evadewhattheysee asan unfairpenalty. If a lawisnotwidelyagreed to be just—harsh pun-ishmentforthe possession ofmarijuanaforpersonal use, say—then the authoritiesoften turn a blind eye.The main reason forthe repeal of Prohi-bition wasthatthe temperance movementnevermanaged to persuade mostAmeri-cansthatdrinkingalcohol wastrulywick-ed. Amongthe world’smostwidelyﬂout-ed lawsare those againstspeeding. Manydriverssee little harm in it: some will evenﬂash theirheadlightsto warn others ofspeed trapsahead. In mostcountrieswhere female genital mutilation (FGM) iscommon, itisformallybanned. Butprose-cutionsare rare.Atthe moment, the mostegregious sex-ual harassersare no doubtfearful. But his-torysuggeststhat, iflarge numbersof menfeel thattheyare beingunjustlylumped inwith rapists, theywill be unlikelyto step inwhen a woman isbeingpestered. And ifmen thinkthatthe rulesofworkplace be-haviourare beingredrawn too tightly, theywill notbackherup ifshe complains. Mi-nortransgressionswill thusremain com-mon—and, when the storm hasdieddown, majoronescould pickup again.“Women, I’m beggingyou: thinkthisthrough,” writesClaire Berlinski in Ameri-can Interest, a magazine. “We nowhave, ineﬀect, a crime thatcomeswith a swift anddraconian penalty, butno properdeﬁni-tion.” Agolden opportunityto tackle ha-rassmentcould be squandered.Some women also fretthatamongthe#MeToo storiesare more than a fewthatstraytoo close to framingwomen asweak,helplessand lackingin sexual agency. Inthe Cut, an online women’smagazine, Re-becca Traisterwarnsofa backlash: “all itwill take isone particularlylame allega-tion…to turn the tide from deep umbrageon behalfofwomen to pityforthe poor,bullied men.” Atleasttwo politiciansac-cused ofsexual impropriety, Carl Sargeantfrom Walesand Dan Johnson from Ken-tucky, have killed themselves.Fewmen have yetdared to go publicwith theirreservations. Butplentywill sayin private thatsome ofthe #MeToo stories The EconomistDecember23rd2017 International832seem to strayinto revisionism. Without thefull storyitishard to judge. Buta man whoreadsthatanotherhasbeen sacked for put-tinga hand on a woman’sknee mayprot-est, notwithoutreason, thatmen have al-waysbeen expected to take the sexualinitiative and are nowsupposed to bemind-readers, too. “Aﬃrmative consent”—the notion gainingcurrencyon campusthatexplicitverbal agreementshould besoughtateverystage asa relationship un-folds—maybe a ﬁne idea.

Butthe sexesdiﬀeroverogling awoman ormakingunwelcome sexualisedremarks. Youngmen’sattitudesare moresimilarto women’sthan oldermen’sare,butthe gap persists.Sometimes, a consensuscan be forgedbycallingon deeper, long-held socialnorms. MsBicchieri citescampaignsagainstFGM thathave described uncutgirlsaspure, intactand asGod made them.From thatviewpoint, FGMviolatesfunda-mental Islamicvalues. Campaignersagainstdomesticviolence in Latin Ameri-ca sometimestryto getmachista attitudesto workforthem bysayingthata “realman” isthe familyprotectorand wouldtherefore neverhithiswife orchild. MsBic-chieri speculatesthatoldermen—thegroup mostlikelyto minimise sexual ha-rassmentand leastlikelyto be won over byfeministarguments—mightbe broughtround bythe notion thatupsettingwomenisnotthe behaviourofa gentleman.Ultimately, though, a newnorm willonlybe adopted ifitiswidelyagreed to beimportant. Forsexual harassment, thatmeansdemonstratingthe harm itdoes.Hundredsofstudieshave looked athowmarriage, motherhood and education af-fectwomen’scareersand earnings, but thedamage from harassmenthaslargelybeenoverlooked. The fewstudiesthatexist sug-gestitisan underappreciated reason whywomen are paid and promoted lessthanmen, and even whyso fewwomen workin traditionallymale ﬁelds. In a paperpublished in Mayin Gender&Society, an academicjournal, HeatherMcLaughlin, ChristopherUggen and AmyBlackstone analysed responsesfrom par-ticipantsin the Youth DevelopmentStudy,which hasfollowed a cohortin StPaul,Minnesota, since 1988. In 2002-03, whenparticipantswere aged 28-30, 11% ofthewomen who had jobssaid theyhad suf-fered sexual harassmentatworkin the pre-viousyear. Two yearslater, theyearnedlessthan the otherwomen, and were morelikelyto be in ﬁnancial distress. More thanhalfhad changed jobs. Forthose who hadbeen harassed repeatedlyorexperiencedunwanted touching, the ﬁgure was79%. In follow-up interviewsthe researchersheard howsome ofthose women hadabandoned careerstheyhad spentyearstrainingfor, orleftjobsdespite having nootheremployment. Some feltthatthis wasthe onlywayto escape. Othersfeltbe-trayed bytheiremployers’ and theircol-leagues’ feeble responses. TheysawHRstaﬀasmore interested in hushingthingsup than stoppingthe harassment. Some ofthe intervieweessaid their em-ployerhad been unwillingto confront aman who wasseen asa starperformer.And manyofthose broughtdown bytherecentallegationshad longbeen treated asuntouchable because theybroughtin a lotofbusiness. Butturninga blind eye to sexu-al harassmentisnowriskyforﬁrms. MrWeinstein’sstarwasalreadyfadingbeforethe accusationsagainsthim were madepublic. Since then, the Weinstein Com-pany, which he founded with hisbrother,hashad to seeka buyer. Firmsthatare laxaboutsexual harass-mentare wakingup to the riskofexpen-sive lawsuits. Recentresearch into “toxic”workers, whose behaviourharmsa com-pany’sassetsorotheremployees, suggeststhatemployers’ self-interestshould havecaused them to take harassmentmore seri-ouslyall along. In a paperpublished in2015 in the Harvard BusinessReview, Mi-chael Housman ofCornerstone OnDe-mand, a consultancy, and Dylan MinorofNorthwestern Universityanalysed dataon 50,000 workersin 11ﬁrms. Theyfoundthattoxicworkerswere much more pro-ductive than the average—presumablybe-cause equallyunpleasantpeople whowere lessproductive had been letgo. Butthatwasmore than outweighed bythedamage theydid to theircolleagues’ pro-ductivityand byjob churn, aspeople re-signed to getawayfrom them. Aﬁrm doesbetterto getrid ofa toxicworker, they con-cluded, than to replace an average one bysomeone in the mostproductive 1%.The ﬁnal step in creatinga durable so-cial norm, saysMsBicchieri, iswhen nor-mative expectationsbecome empiricalones—thatis, when everyone can see thatthe newrulesare sticking. Forsexual ha-rassment, thismeansthatwomen mustbeable to continue speakingoutand perpe-tratorsmustcontinue to be punished. Italso meansthatmen who mighthave beenperpetratorscontinue to thinktwice anddecide againstit. Duncan Green ofOxfam, the author of“HowChange Happens”, makesa distinc-tion between the self-deluded and the bul-lies. The self-deluded maybe putoﬀ bytheirnewfound understandingofhowstronglywomen feel aboutunwanted sex-ual attentions. Butthe bulliesare unlikelyto care, and mayeven enjoythe thought ofmakingwomen miserable. Detailed ac-countsofsome ofthe allegationsaired inrecentweekssuggestthathumiliatingwomen waspartofthe point. AbiggerstickFora bullyto stop, saysMrGreen, he needsto be afraid ofsomeone. Asmore womenrise to seniorpositions, more ofthem willhave the powerto face the harassersdown.Until then, the job will often fall to othermen, asboth managersand bystanders.Thatisthe biggestreason women needmen with them in a united front. 7The EconomistDecember23rd201785For daily coverage of business, visitEconomist.com/business-ﬁnance 1BESIDE a serene lake in Switzerland sitsamodern glassbuildingcalled the Cube.Wide-leafed tobacco plantsgrowin thelobby.

Anti-smokingcampaigners, includingVeraLuiza da Costa e Silva, who leadsthe im-plementation ofthe World Health Organi-sation’santi-smokingtreaty, are particular-lydismayed byﬁrms’ attemptsto stymieanti-tobacco measuresin poorand middle-income countries. Tobacco-makershave sued countries orthreatened litigation overtheirrules to lim-itconventional smoking.

E-cigaretteshave been around for awhile; a newerinvention are products thatheattobacco withoutproducingall thedeadlystuﬀthatcomesfrom burningit.PMIsellsone such “heatnotburn” (HNB)product, called IQOS, in nearlythree dozencountries, includingItaly, Switzerland, Ja-pan, Russia and South Africa.

Ithasbeen metwith scepticism. Accordingto Drda Costa e Silva, the foundation ispartofa “long-established and sinister pat-tern ofcorporate chicanery”. “I recognisethatwe have a deﬁcitofcredibility andtrust,” saysMrCalantzopoulos. “I’m notaskingpeople to believe me—I’m askingthem to verifywhatwe are doing, includ-ingthe science we produce.” Partofthe diﬃcultyin judging the mer-itsofalternativesto cigarettes, says Mat-thewMyersofthe Campaign ForTobacco-Free Kids, an American anti-tobacco group,isthattheirtraitsvarywildly. Abubble-gum ﬂavoured e-cigarette mayattractyoungerusers, forinstance; an e-cigarettewith too little nicotine will notsate a con-ventional smoker, so will nothelp himquit. Studiesthatgroup all e-cigarettes to-gethermaytherefore be misguided.

In Ja-pan, where abouta third ofmen smoke, bythe end of2016, 70% ofIQOSusershadswitched from conventional cigarettes andwere usingIQOSalone.

Oﬃcial spendingon fu-neral servicesreached some 58bn roublesin 2016. Butmostofthe market—another120bn-150bn roubles—remainsin the shad-ows, accordingto oﬃcial estimates. Change maybe afoot.

An unin-tended consequence maybe to allowmorespace forentrepreneurs, who see opportu-nitiesto disruptRussia’smostarchaicsec-tor. “Thisispracticallythe lastsphere to gothrough a markettransition,” saysOlegShelyagov, ownerofRitual.ru, an innova-tive funeral-servicesproviderin Moscow. Russia’shistoryhasshaped the indus-tryin unusual ways. Underthe tsarsthechurch oversawmostfuneralsand ceme-teries. The Bolsheviksnationalised churchland and property, abolished traditionalrituals, and decreed thatall citizens musthave identical funerals. In practice, how-ever, the Sovietauthoritiespaid little atten-tion to burial practices. Afterthe SovietUnion’scollapse “abso-lute bacchanalia” and “absolute banditry”tookhold, saysVladimirPanin, director ofSTIKS-S, one ofMoscow’soldestfuneralbureaus. Overtime some 20 ﬁrms, includ-ingMrPanin’s, became “specialised cityservices”, orprivatelyowned ﬁrmsthatthe citylicensesasfuneral providers in re-turn fora small stake (no lessthan 5%).These ﬁrmsdeveloped a simple businessstrategy, payingrentto hospitalsandmorguesforoﬃceson the premises, thenwaitingforthe inevitable appearance ofclients.

The collapse incommoditypricesthatundid Venezuelawasaccompanied bya sharp reversal ofcapital ﬂowsto emergingeconomiesthatbegan in 2011and gathered pace duringthe“tapertantrum” of2013.

The gov-ernmentsofemergingeconomiesincreas-inglyborrowin theirown currencies.These are no longertightlypegged to thedollar, asmanywere in the 1980sand1990s, orto gold, asin the 19th century. Of54 emergingmarketsMrSterne hasexam-ined, only11have foreign-currencybondsworth more than 20% oftheirGDP (seechart). So defaultingon hard-currency debtisneitherasnecessarynorashelpful asitwas. Even ifa sovereign were to forswear abigchunkofitsdollarobligations, impos-inga steep losson creditors, itwould onlysave a large percentage ofa small amount. The costsofdefault, on the other hand,are somewhatﬁxed. Defaultis, in legalterms, a discrete event. Renegingon debtworth 10% ofGDPmaybe justasdamagingto a country’sreputation asrenegingondebtworth twice asmuch. And the costsare notjustﬁnancial. “Youhave to negoti-ate with the creditorcommittees.

Theythen assumedthatinvestorsboughtall the stocks thattheyexpected to meetorbeatthe consen-susofanalysts’ forecasts; and thatinves-torscould short(ie, beton a decliningprice) the stocksofthose thatwere pre-dicted notto reach theirestimates. Theymade theirinvestmenttwo monthsbe-fore the end ofa quarterlyreporting per-iod and gotoutoftheirpositionsonemonth afterthe quarterended (bywhichtime the earningshave been reported).In the late 1980sand 1990s, thiswouldhave been a highlysuccessful strategy,achievingexcessreturns(overthoseachieved bystocksofsimilarsize) of4% ormore everyquarter. Butthese abnormalreturnshave dropped: in recentyears theyhave been only2% a quarter. Asimilaref-fectappeared when examiningthe re-turnsthatwould have been achieved byperfectlypredictingthose companies thatachieved annual earningsgrowth.Although an excessreturn of2% aquarterwould still be highlyattractive, itwould require a perfectforecasting re-cord. Thatsuggeststhe number-crunch-ingperformed byfallible analystsand in-vestorsproducesmuch lowerreturns.The intriguingquestion iswhythosereturnshave been falling. The authors ar-gue thatthe decline isbecause ofthe risingimportance ofintangible investmentsinrecentdecades(in areassuch assoftwareortrademarkdevelopment). Such invest-mentmaybe a bigdriverofvalue growth. Accountantshave struggled to adapt. Ifacompanybuysan intangible asset, suchasa patent, from anotherbusiness, it isclassed asan asseton the balance-sheet.Butiftheydevelop an intangible withinthe business, thatisclassed asan expense,and thusdeducted from proﬁts. Asthe au-thorsnote: “Acompanypursuingan inno-vation strategybased on acquisitions willappearmore proﬁtable and asset-rich thanasimilarenterprise developingitsinnova-tionsinternally.”Asa result, the authorsargue, reportedearningsare no longersuch a good mea-sure ofa company’sproﬁts, and thusmaynotbe a useful guide to future share perfor-mance. To testthisproposition, they divid-ed companiesinto ﬁve quintilesbased ontheirintangible investment. Sure enough,the more companiesspenton intangibles,the lowerthe excessreturn available tothose who correctlyforecastthe earnings.The paper’smessage echoesthe themesofa newbook** byJonathan Haskel andStian Westlake, which exploresthe im-pactofthe growingimportance ofintan-gible assetsin modern economies. Thebookﬁndsa linkbetween the poorpro-ductivityrecord ofmanyleadingecono-miessince the crisisof2008, and the slug-gish rate ofinvestmentin intangibleassetssince then. The problem isthatintangibleshavespillovers. Acompanymayundertake ex-pensive research and development, butthe gainsmaybe realised byotherbusi-nesses. Onlya fewcompanies(the likesofGoogle) can achieve the scale neededto take reliable advantage oftheir intangi-ble investments. Unlike machinesandequipment, intangiblesmayhave limitedresale value. So the risksoffailure mayputbusinessesoﬀintangible investment.Thisisboth good newsand bad newsforinvestors. On the one hand, itmay ex-plain whyproﬁtshave remained high rel-ative to GDP. In theory, high returnsshould have attracted a lotmore invest-mentand the resultingcompetitionshould have driven down proﬁts. But thediﬃcultyin exploitingintangibles mayhave prevented that. On the otherhand,the reluctance ofmanybusinessesto in-vestin intangiblesmayrestricttheir scopeforgrowth in future.

Environmental activism

The Economist December 23rd 2017 93

Punk science 

A growing movement seeks to make
the tools of science available to 
everyone (including you)

APAIR of toddler’s tights. That is the
most important component of the
device that Max Liboiron designed
to measure the ocean’s plastic debris. 
In 2014 Ms Liboiron, a geographer, took
up a job at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland on the Atlantic coast. Two
years earlier Canada’s Conservative gov-
ernment had passed a bill that weakened
environmental protection and cut the bud-
get for monitoring the country’s water and
air. Ms Liboiron wanted to help plug the
gap. She had no staﬀ and no equipment.
But she had a feeling that, if she could get
around the second of those problems, she
could sort out the ﬁrst. Given appropriate
tools, she suspected, locals would be more
than happy to survey the waters surround-
ing the island for marine plastics. The
ocean provides Newfoundlanders with
food and jobs; knowing what ends up in
the ﬁsh they eat and sell is crucial. 
Newfoundland is not awash with fancy
scientiﬁc equipment going begging. Baby
stockings, however, are widely available.
Attached to half a plastic bottle as a mouth
and towed behind a boat, the synthetic
tights (cotton will absorb water and sink)
sieve surface water for some of the ﬁve tril-
lion or so pieces of plastic that are estimat-
ed to pollute the world’s oceans. 
BabyLegs, as Ms Liboiron has dubbed
her contraption, is the sort of do-it-yourself
kit being used by an increasing number of
concerned citizens seeking to monitor the
soil, water and air. Such tools are typically
cheaper than the professionals’ alterna-
tives. The Manta Trawls with which scien-
tists skim the oceans for microplastics start at around US$3,500.
BabyLegs, which you can put together yourself using instructions
from Ms Liboiron’s Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Re-
search (CLEAR), costs just a few dollars. 
But price is only part of the point. The bigger issue is agency. Ba-
byLegs and schemes like it not only provide a cheap way to gather
data governments are ignoring. They also oﬀer citizens an active
role in doing so; a way to help themselves, and express their com-
mitment to others, on their own terms. It may look scrappy; it may
be comparatively primitive (although, increasingly, it is not). But it
is liberating. In 1977, in the very heavenly dawn of London’s punk-
rock scene, a crude, photocopied magazine told its readers: “This is
a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now start a band.” They did
so by the thousand. Now that punk aesthetic has come to science.

Big in Japan
Safecast, an NGO based in Tokyo, provides the most comprehen-
sive picture of radiation levels across Japan. Its data come from
hundreds of devices, either assembled from Safecast’s kits (which
cost $500) or built from scratch using instructions on their website.
They consist of a Geiger counter, a GPS unit to log where measure-
ments are made, a simple open-source computer called an Ar-
duino to time-stamp the data and a memory card. 

Pieter Franken, one of Safecast’s founders, started
to map the country’s radiation levels a few days after
the huge earthquake of March 11th 2011. When explo-
sions ripped through the reactors of the tsunami-
struck Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, Mr
Franken, a Dutch computer scientist working in Tokyo,
bought a Geiger counter and went on the road. “On my
ﬁrst drive, the readings I was getting were signiﬁcantly
higher than those being reported on TV,” he says. Radi-
ation levels varied dramatically from street to street; in
some towns far from the plant they were higher than
in those that were close. 
The oﬃcial data were not ﬁne-grained enough to
reveal such patterns. Results from Speedi, the govern-
ment computer system used to predict the path of the
radioactive plume from the plant, were considered too
inaccurate to share with the public. No one trusted the
government’s reassurances when they came.
“I met people on the ground desperate to know ra-
diation levels in their home, school or at work,” Mr
Franken says. He contacted two old friends, Sean Bon-
ner and Joi Ito, tech entrepreneurs with colourful and
impressive CVs, to talk about what to do. Between

them, they cooked up the idea of using vol-
unteers with mobile Geiger counters to
collect data and stream them to a website.
Supplies of commercial instruments
had, understandably, dried up quickly
after the disaster. So Mr Franken patched
one together from parts and connected it to
an iPhone to get GPS co-ordinates for the
data. By the end of the next month he and
other volunteers had built a prototype of
the “bGeigie”, the ﬁrst in a series of detec-
tors that they would make available in kit
form on their site.
In the six years since the disaster, Safe-
cast has moved from the fringes of respect-
able science to its mainstream. Two of its
members were invited to speak in Vienna
in 2014 at a meeting on the Fukushima di-
saster organised by the International
Atomic Energy Agency. In 2016 the team published a paper in the
Journal of Radiological Protection. And perhaps most tellingly of
all, scientists are adopting their methods. “How Radioactive Is
Our Ocean”, a project at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institu-
tion in Massachusetts, is getting people to send samples of seawa-
ter from beaches on the west coast. The scientist leading the pro-
ject, Ken Buesseler, met members of the Safecast team in 2012
shortly after he published a study on radioactive isotopes in the
ﬁsh and waters oﬀ the coast of Fukushima. When he could not
raise money from the federal government to look for those iso-
topes oﬀ America’s Paciﬁc coast, he discussed with Safecast how
to establish a citizen-science project to collect the data instead.
Citizen science has been around for ages—professional astron-
omers, geologists and archaeologists have long had their work
supplemented by enthusiastic amateurs—and new cheap instru-
ments can usefully spread the movement’s reach. What is more
striking about bGeigie and its like, though, is that citizens and com-
munities can use such instruments to inform decisions on which
science would otherwise be silent—or mistrusted. For example,
getting hold of a bGeigie led some people planning to move home
after Fukushima to decide they were safer staying put. 
Ms Liboiron’s research at CLEAR also stresses self-determina-
tion. It is subject to “community peer review”: those who have
participated in the lab’s scientiﬁc work decide whether it is valid
and merits publication. In the 1980s ﬁshermen had tried to warn
government scientists that stocks were in decline. Their cries were
ignored and the sudden collapse of Newfoundland’s cod stocks in
1992 had left 35,000 jobless. The people taking science into their
own hands with Ms Liboiron want to make sure that in the future
the ﬁndings which matter to them get heard. 

Swell maps
Issues such as climate change, plastic waste and air pollution be-
come more tangible to those with the tools in their hands to mea-
sure them. Those tools, in turn, encourage more people to get in-
volved. Eymund Diegel, a South African urban planner who is
also a keen canoeist, has long campaigned for the Gowanus canal,
close to his home in Brooklyn, to be cleaned up. Eﬄuent from
paint manufacturers, tanneries, chemical plants and more used to
ﬂow into the canal with such proﬂigacy that by the early 20th cen-
tury the Gowanus was said to be jammed solid. The New York
mob started using the waterway as a dumping ground for dead
bodies. In the early part of this century it was still badly polluted. 
In 2009 Mr Diegel contacted Public Lab, an NGO based in New
Orleans that helps people investigate environmental concerns.
They directed him to what became his most powerful weapon in
the ﬁght—a mapping rig consisting of a large helium balloon, 300
metres (1,000 feet) of string and an old digital camera. A camera or
smartphone ﬁxed to such a balloon can take more detailed photo-

graphs than the satellite imagery used by the likes of
Google for its online maps, and Public Lab provides
software, called MapKnitter, that can stitch these pho-
tos together into surveys.
These data—and community pressure—helped per-
suade the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
make the canal eligible for money from a “superfund”
programme which targets some of America’s most
contaminated land. Mr Diegel’s photos have revealed
a milky plume ﬂowing into the canal from a concealed
chemical tank which the EPA’s own surveys had some-
how missed. The agency now plans to spend $500m
cleaning up the canal. 
Jeﬀrey Warren, who created MapKnitter, is one of
the founders of Public Lab. The group was set up to
help locals map the devastation caused by the oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. When the Deepwater
Horizon rig exploded, Mr Warren was studying digital
cartography as part of a master’s degree at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. Wanting to help but
lacking local knowledge, he called the Louisiana Buck-
et Brigade, an environmental group in New Orleans,
and was put through to Shannon Dosemagen. The bri-
gade is named after the plastic buckets it provides to
residents concerned about reﬁneries in the area to
help them in gathering samples for laboratory analy-
sis. This has often revealed levels of toxic chemicals,
such as benzene, many times higher than those al-
lowed by law. Those data have helped local people,
who are often poor and black, to lobby for change. 
Tapping in to her experience with the brigade, Ms
Dosemagen, who is now Public Lab’s executive direc-
tor, rapidly organised training sessions in a New Or-
leans park. Cameras on balloons and kites began snap-
ping the oil’s progress; MapKnitter joined the pictures
together to show the impact of the slick (see photo
above). Seven years on, Public Lab still springs into ac-
tion after industrial accidents. Within days of Hurri-
cane Harvey’s landfall in Texas last August coast-
guards asked Mr Warren for volunteers to help track
chemical spills by combing through aerial photos.
Public Lab’s website now hosts discussion boards
on topics that range from ﬁnding decibel meters for
smartphones to detecting metal ions in water, along
with a range of impressive tools. In line with its do-it-
yourself ethic, the site oﬀers no ready-built equip-
ment; those who build their own devices, Public Lab
believes, are more likely to use them. There are instruc-
tions for converting a camera to take infrared images

that will help determine crop health as well as for spectrometers
which can show up the chemical composition of a liquid or gas by
analysing light shone through it. Using a design PublicLab has
kindly made available at its website to readers of The Economist,
you can build one yourself, either just for the fun of it, or to mea-
sure the sugar content of your wine, or for some punk’d up pur-
pose of your own (see box below for details). 
A similar ethos is also beginning to seep into university labs
and research institutes. Cheap 3D printers and computer-aided
design programs that allow design ﬁles to be shared online mean
that ever more apparatus can be made in the lab, rather than or-
dered from a catalogue. The economic argument for doing so is
compelling. A plastic test-tube rack can cost more than $20. Down-
loading one of the many diﬀerent ﬁles for the rack of your choice
and printing it costs a tenth of that. A $1,000 laboratory jack for lift-
ing and levelling equipment can be made for $5. 

X-ray spex
It is not just simple pieces of lab equipment that can be printed.
Earlier this year Tom Baden of the University of Sussex and his col-
leagues published plans for a 3D-printable ﬂuorescence micro-
scope, called FlyPi, which uses ultraviolet light and ﬂuorescent
dye to improve its analysis of samples. Mr Baden estimates that it
can be set up for less than $250. Flashy commercial microscopes
on the same lines can cost thousands of dollars. Mr Baden, a neu-
roscientist who studies the eyes and brains of zebra ﬁsh, says that
although the quality of a FlyPi may not be that of a commercial
model, the low cost means that his lab can have several extra mi-
croscopes on the go at once alongside the high-spec one they
already had.
“Open hardware” like the FlyPi is a boon for scientists in poor
countries. Mr Baden and fellow neuroscientists Lucia Prieto-Go-
dino and Sadiq Yusuf founded TREND in Africa, an NGO that or-
ganises summer schools for researchers. Courses on open labware
begin with building a printer which can itself be made largely
from printed parts. Printed scientiﬁc tools can be repaired cheaply,
as can the printer. 
Joshua Pearce, an engineer at Michigan Technological Univer-
sity in Houghton, believes the time is now ripe for change. Even
mass-produced plastic trinkets and household goods are cheaper

to print than to buy. “If we can beat the shower curtain
ring-makers,” he says, “the equipment manufacturers
have got no chance.”
Mr Pearce, an early advocate of open hardware, is
pushing the concept hard. Atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is a method of building up very thin, uniform
ﬁlms on a surface. In chip manufacturing, the process
can lay down transistors that are no more than a 100 at-
oms across. Engineers are exploring its potential for
making thin, wearable sensors, implants and drug-de-
livery devices.
Many researchers would love to get their hands on
a system but, at a cost of $250,000, few can aﬀord it.
That cost reﬂects the sophistication of the kit required
to carry out the enterprise. ALD must take place in a
carefully controlled vacuum. Mr Pearce, however,
wants to produce one that anyone can make in the lab
for a fraction of the cost with printable plastic parts. 
Hundreds of scientists like Mr Pearce and Mr Baden
are uploading their plans for instruments to the inter-
net, where they are scrutinised by citizen scientists
hoping to improve the tools they are using, and thus
the things they can study, monitor and make a fuss
about. As new, cheaper, easier-to-use instruments be-
come available, more people across the world will
step into the breach as governments threaten to scale
back their eﬀorts to monitor the environment and set
their own agendas.
In Chile, Exploratorio Sombrero hopes to map
poorer neighbourhoods of Melipilla, the city where it
is based. In Indonesia, Lifepatch has helped farmers
whose land was engulfed by a volcanic eruption. Safe-
cast is growing, too. In April, it unveiled a solar-pow-
ered device that can detect levels of particulate air pol-
lution as well as radiation. Within two years, Safecast
plans to have more such sensors in America than the
EPA. That will improve national statistics at a time the
government shows little interest in doing so; more im-
portant, it will empower communities which never
had the knowledge to aﬀect their futures before. *

Ineﬃcient
equilibrium 

The profession’s problem with women
could be a problem with economics itself

C A M B R I D G E , M A S S A C H U S E T T S

ECONOMISTS like to see themselves
as generators of rational explana-
tions. They scorn fuzzy thinking and
beliefs that have no basis in fact; they at-
tack problems with a ruthless logic. Happy
as they are to turn this beady gaze on oth-
ers, though, when it comes to looking at
themselves they may be as befogged as
anyone else.
Take the issue of female representation
in their ﬁeld. Academic economists are
overwhelmingly male. According to infor-
mation from university websites, about
20% of Europe’s senior economists are
women. In America, 15% of full professors
are women. At Harvard, arguably the most
prestigious economics department in the
world, the faculty pictures that beam
down from the wall feature 43 senior
members of the department. Only three
are women. Two have tenure. 
This does not mean there is necessarily
a problem with economics per se. Though
there are fewer women in economics than
in the humanities, the other social sciences
or the life and environmental sciences,
there is similar under-representation in
mathematics, engineering and physics. 
But Donna Ginther, a professor of eco-
nomics at the University of Kansas, has
found telling evidence that women are not
just scarcer in economics; they also face a
thicker glass ceiling. Having started a job
that has the prospect of tenure, women
achieve that aim at a rate 12 percentage points below that of men.
This is true even after adjusting (as much as possible) for diﬀer-
ences in family circumstances and publication record. In Ameri-
can universities women who achieve tenure are promoted to full
professor within seven years at a rate of 29% compared to 56% for
men. Adjusting for other factors, Ms Ginther still ﬁnds a gap of 23
percentage points. In other social and natural sciences such diﬀer-
ences are a thing of the past.
Unsurprisingly, given the above, women in economics are un-
happier both than the men they work with and than the women
who work in other disciplines, including those with similar gen-
der disparities. In maths, computer science, engineering and the
physical sciences, Ms Ginther found no discernible diﬀerence be-
tween the satisfaction reported by men and women with tenure
or on the tenure track. In economics the gap is quite big. And it is
growing larger (see chart on next page).
Ms Ginther’s work is part of a mounting case that economics
has an insidious bias against women. If this is so it is bad both for
women in the profession and for women who might have entered
the profession but did not. And it is bad for men in the profession,
who are stuck with less impressive colleagues than they might
otherwise have and less diverse workplaces. 
There is every chance that that this lack of diversity constrains
or distorts the ﬁeld’s intellectual development. Women within
economics have diﬀerent opinions from men: in 2013 a survey of
American economists found that men in the ﬁeld were more scep-
tical of regulation and high minimum wages, and less likely to fa-

vour redistribution, than women were. If systemic
gender bias skews the way the ﬁeld looks at things,
that has implications for the policymakers and others
looking to academic economists for analysis, advice or
indeed wisdom. 

Who is rational, who is choosing?
The profession has not thought about these issues all
that deeply. Beatrice Cherrier, a historian of economics
at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, outside Paris,
notes that when it does so, it tends to see the matter in
terms either of ineﬃciency or choice. 
In 1957 Gary Becker, an economist at the University
of Chicago, suggested such an ineﬃciency might come
from men not wanting female colleagues, and thus en-
couraging their managers to exclude productive work-
ers. In a meritocratic, perfectly functioning market,
competition would weed out such employers. With-
out tough competition, though, such prejudices would
lead to good female researchers being shut out. 
Given the problem’s persistence over the decades,
this sort of argument leads to the conclusion that aca-
demic economics is not as open to the bracing winds
of competition as those in the ﬁeld have been
schooled to believe. This may be why many prefer the
alternative family of explanations which sees the poor
representation of women as a rational choice. Women

who might become economists will make the decision as to
whether they should do so based on their abilities, their prefer-
ences and their constraints. If women are worse economists, or do
not like the subject, then perhaps the choice which many of them
make not to pursue the subject is an entirely rational one.
If relative ability or innate preferences are the dominant factor,
then women’s under-representation is not a problem for econo-
mists to ﬁx. If, on the other hand, women have a similar range of
innate potential and inclination towards the subject as men, but
are avoiding or leaving it because it treats them worse, then the
burden is on economists to change. And that is the way that the ev-
idence currently points.
Female economists start oﬀ in a minority. In America there are
2.9 men for every woman majoring in economics; in Britain, 2.6. In
both countries women increasingly dominate the undergraduate
population in general; in both the share choosing economics is
falling. There may be some truth in the suggestion that women
avoid it because they feel they lack the algebra-crunching ability it
requires—but it seems there is probably not much. A study pub-
lished in 2015 found that, in Britain, diﬀerences in maths qualiﬁca-
tions explained only a sixth of the gender gap in applications. Re-
search on why women at Harvard disproportionately give up
economics after introductory courses also attributed only a small
part of the eﬀect to mathematical aptitude. 
On average, it seems that undergraduate women who stick
with economics are better at it than their male classmates. In Brit-
ain women in economics are more likely to get a 2:1 or a 1st than
men are. This could be because quite a lot of men studying eco-
nomics see it as a ticket to success in ﬁnance; they will stick with it
despite a lack of aptitude in a way similarly able women do not. 

A bias against bias
It is also possible that the way that economics talks about the
world is less palatable to young women than to young men. A
study published in 2006 found that women start introductory
economics courses more sceptical about the subject than men,
and the diﬀerence increases between the start and end of the
course, despite no diﬀerences in their performance. Claudia Gol-
din, a professor of economics at Harvard, thinks the way that the
subject is taught—with an emphasis on formalism, rather than hu-
man dynamics—could be part of the problem.
The women who graduate in economics go into PhD pro-
grammes at roughly the same rate as men; they tend to drop out of
them at the same rate, too. But once they
move on to seeking tenure, women are
much more readily lost. This might mean
that they are disproportionately pulled
down other career paths they ﬁnd more at-
tractive than men do. It could also mean
they are pushed out. 
One common suggestion is that wom-
en do not like the famously combative
style of economics seminars. Motherhood
may also be an issue. American academics
usually have the option to pause their ten-
ure clock when they have a child. Heather
Antecol of Claremont McKenna College
and Kelly Bedard and Jenna Stearns of the
University of California, Santa Barbara
have found that this family-friendly policy
disadvantages female economists. Women
in the ﬁeld taking advantage of the extra
time mostly use it for child care; men often
use it for focused research undistracted by
students. The eﬀect has been to lower the
chances of a woman getting tenure in her
ﬁrst job by 22 percentage points. 
This points to a more general issue

about articles and publication. If women face a higher
bar, one might expect them to be better than the men.
But Ms Ginther ﬁnds that in the ﬁve years leading up to
2008, male economists published on average two
more papers than female ones. A more recent study of
the top 30 American universities found no statistical
diﬀerence in the total publication count, but that
men’s papers were published in more prestigious jour-
nals. If women are at best no more productive than
men, a faculty-level gender disparity might be an eﬃ-
cient outcome, albeit one tilted by the disproportion in
the pool of undergraduates. Actively seeking to
change the ratio could damage the profession. 
Ms Ginther is sceptical. People often behave ac-
cording to biases they are unaware of; that could di-
rectly aﬀect the promotion process. Take teaching eval-
uations. There is no evidence that women teach
economics any worse than men; their students get the
same grades in exams. But in 2017 a study found that
student evaluations of female teachers in economics
and business courses were systematically worse than
those of men. Poor evaluations can aﬀect tenure deci-
sions. One speculative way of understanding this re-
sult, and perhaps the problem more broadly, would be
to wonder whether economics attracts students par-
ticularly prone to sexism. 
Or take publication. Erin Hengel of the University
of Liverpool ﬁnds that papers by women submitted to
Econometrica, a top journal, take six months longer to
go through the review process than men’s do. She also
ﬁnds that the abstracts of papers written by women
are signiﬁcantly improved (according to an objective
measure of readability) between submission and ﬁnal
draft, and that as their careers progress, the women’s
ﬁrst drafts improve. Neither eﬀect is seen in men (see
chart on next page). This suggests women are being
held to higher standards, which may explain their low-
er publication count. 
Heather Sarsons, a PhD candidate at Harvard, has
investigated the eﬀects of co-authorship. Looking at
top American departments, she found that when re-
searchers write papers on their own, women see their
chances of promotion rise by roughly the same

2 amount as men do. But when a man is a co-author on a paper he
sees his chances of getting tenure rise by 8%, while for a woman
the bump is a measly 2%. That adds up: Ms Sarsons ﬁnds women
are 17 percentage points less likely to get tenure than men with sim-
ilar publication records.
It may be relevant that, in economics, authors are listed simply
in alphabetical order; there is no information about who contrib-
uted what. In the absence of that information, implicit biases can
run wild. Ms Sarsons notes that in sociology, where the lead au-
thor is listed ﬁrst, there is no such co-authorship penalty. She also
notes, anecdotally, that on occasions when she has seen the same
research presented to diﬀerent audiences by a male co-author and
a female one, it has been her impression that the men’s presenta-
tions go down better.
Ms Sarsons found that colleagues responding to her paper
were supportive, but careful to rule out alternative explanations.
“Economists do tend to think about every possible channel. That’s
good,” she says. She tested several such alternatives herself, and
found them wanting: for example, women are not systematically
co-authoring with higher-status men who might legitimately be
imagined to be doing more of the work. 
Some suggested that the people making decisions about pro-
motion knew that men were choosing to co-author with less able
women out of pity, or that women work less hard when there’s a
man on the paper too. Neither Ms Sarsons’ research nor her expe-
rience lead her to entertain such notions. To some, this would
seem like healthy scholarship. To others, this burden of proof
when explaining gender disparities in their ﬁelds displays what
Ms Ginther calls “a bias against bias”.

A-long-way-from-home economics
Economists are increasingly aware of this. David Laibson, the
chair of Harvard’s economics faculty, has brought in Mahzarin Ba-
naji, a leading researcher on implicit bias, to brief search and pro-
motion committees. The representation of women is not the only
issue here; economics departments are also unrepresentative in
terms of faculty from various minorities. Mr Laibson is pushing
his committees to lean less on intuition and opinion and more on
engagement with the research itself when making decisions. 
Because people research things based on their experiences,
greater representation of women in the ﬁeld would change it in a
number of ways. For one thing, it would take gender
more seriously. Men have not proved particularly in-
terested in understanding gender disparity; almost all
of the research on gender discrimination within eco-
nomics is done by women. 
There may be deep structural barriers to break
through. Historians note that, over the course of the
20th century, economics was butched up. In 1920, 19%
of doctorates listed in the American Economic Review
were being written by women. By 1940 the number
had fallen to 7%. This coincided with a redeﬁnition of
the ﬁeld towards mathematics and the world of paid
and thus predominantly male labour. Concerns such
as social work and home economics, in which women
tended to specialise, were sidelined. 
Today, women in economics gravitate towards
more people-oriented subdisciplines like health, edu-
cation, development and labour. Emmanuelle Auriol,
who co-ordinates a network of female European econ-
omists, worries that this may disadvantage both those
ﬁelds and the women who work in them. Journal edi-
tors and reviewers (who are mostly male) are less like-
ly to be familiar with the subﬁelds in which women
are more represented; they may also think them less
important. 
It is possible the greater representation of women
in these areas lowers their prestige. Whether that great-

er representation is a matter of choice—women may
for various reasons ﬁnd such work more interest-
ing—or a result of women being pushed towards less
prestigious topics is hard to say. If the latter, the dy-
namics will favour a vicious circle.
It is not just the topics women work on that matters;
it is how they work on them. Becker won a Nobel Prize
in part for his work on families and households—areas
where female scholars tend to concentrate. His ap-
proach, though, was theoretical, while much of the
work done by women has tended to be more applied
and thus, Ms Cherrier points out, less prestigious. Up
until the 1980s the data collection, microsimulations
and randomised-control trials (RCTs) that women
tended to do would struggle to reach the top journals.
Since the 1980s, as applied microeconomics has be-
come more prestigious and economists have changed
the ways their theories have been tested, the women
who have tended to do this sort of work have achieved
better publication records, and risen in rank. But some,
including Ms Cherrier, fear a backlash. For example, in-
creasing criticism has been levelled at the RCTs in de-
velopment economics disproportionately carried out
by women. Rachel Glennerster, the director of the
Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, a research out-
ﬁt based at MIT that runs RCTs, worries that some of
this criticism has a rather macho materiality, seeing
health and education as minor relative to “bigger” is-
sues like ports and roads. She repeatedly meets people
who underestimate how hard the RCT approach is to
run well. “As a society,” she wonders, “do we assume
things are easier if there are more women doing
them?” 
Imbalances in power built deep into society are dif-
ﬁcult to identify with an economist’s level of rigour.
Gender cannot be switched on and oﬀ to see what
would happen without it. But on the basis that eco-
nomics does have a problem, various interventions
might help. Approaches to family leave that don’t priv-
ilege men; scrutiny of the higher drop-out rate of fe-
male undergraduates; explicit description of each au-
thor’s contribution to co-authored papers, as is
common in other disciplines; frank discussion of im-
plicit biases. Some such interventions are easier than
others. For example, studies show that having more
women on the faculty is a powerful encouragement
for women seeking postgraduate positions. But if the
number of women on faculties could readily be raised,
the problem would already have been solved. *

Beijing, dockless bike-shar ing tr ips

Mobike only, September 5th 2017

T HE ﬁrst bicycles were freed on July
28th, 1965. On the previous night
Provo, a Dutch anarchist group, had
put up ﬂyers proclaiming that “the asphalt
terror of the motorised bourgeoisie has
lasted long enough”. A few dozen people
had gathered at the bottom of the Spui, in
central Amsterdam, along with some re-
porters. There were also some police; they
thought the Provos were troublemakers.
Roel van Duijn and Luud Schimmel-
pennink started painting three black bicy-
cles white. “The white bicycle is the ﬁrst
free communal transport,” as their ﬂyer
put it. Once so transﬁgured, the bikes
would simply be left on the streets; to make
them free for all to use, the ﬂyer said, “the
white bicycle is never locked.” And that, it
turned out, was a problem. After they were
let loose on the streets, the white bikes
were impounded by the police. A 1928 stat-
ute, they pointed out, required bikes to
have locks. Ownership was not optional.
A few days later, at a street meeting
where Mr Van Duijn was painting another
bike white, the police ordered him to stop,
and the crowd to disperse. Mr Van Duijn
stood his ground. A policeman whacked
him with a truncheon. That made the
white bikes something of a cause célèbre.
More people joined the movement; more
bikes were painted. But the police kept im-
pounding them. 
Half a century later the streets of Beijing
are full of bikes which are not white, but yellow, or orange and sil-
ver, or some other striking colour. These bikes are not public, but
private, and they are equipped with cunning locks. But they are
still, in their way, taking forward Provo’s dream. 
The yellow bikes are from Ofo, so named because the letters
look like a stick ﬁgure riding a cycle. The system started oﬀ a few
years ago as a voluntary bike-sharing scheme on the campus of
Peking University in Beijing. Today it claims to operate 10m cycles
in some 200 cities worldwide. Mobike, its orange-and-silver rival,
says it has deployed 7m of its bikes in China and abroad. Between
them, they say, they are responsible for around 60m bike rides ev-
ery day. Zhang Yanqi, Ofo’s operations boss, thinks China alone
could support 300m rides a day. 
The diﬀerence between these bikes and those in most of the
public bike-sharing schemes familiar in cities around the world is
that they do not have to be stuck into special docks at the end of
the trip. Like the original white bikes they can be left wherever you
like, and used wherever you ﬁnd one. Unlike the white bikes, they
do have locks. But now it is possible for Ofo and Mobike to give
everyone keys, and charge them for their use. 
If you have the right app, you just point your phone’s camera at
the QR code printed on the bike you want to use. The system un-
locks it, gives you a half-hour ride and charges you one yuan
($0.15). That’s easily enough for most people: most trips on such
bikes in Beijing are very short (see map). When you are through,
just leave it. Soon enough another user will ride it away. If one
doesn’t, someone will be oﬀered an incentive to go and get it.

Whether this model can work on the vast and glo-
bal scale that Ofo and Mobike envision is not yet clear;
that it is beyond anything Provo dreamed of is clear.
The diﬀerence is the product of a half-century of pro-
gress, shaped by politics, commerce, technology and
design, that has seen bike sharing become common-
place across the world.
In some ways little has changed. Cities are still car-
dominated, still congested, still polluted. But the
spread of bike sharing has made millions of lives a bit
easier and a bit better. And it resonates with other
changes in the world today. In more and more realms
of life the convenient ad hoc access provided by digital
systems is taking the place of the assured access once
oﬀered by personal ownership. Streaming beats re-
cords; the cloud beats the hard disk; credit beats cash.

Bicycle thieves
For much of the 20th century, owning your ﬁrst bicycle
was a deﬁnitive rite of passage. Before smartphones,
that bike was typically both the most valuable and
most liberating piece of property a child might own. It
was also a peculiarly vulnerable one.
Oﬃcial ﬁgures tend to downplay bike theft; typical-
ly perhaps one such crime in ﬁve gets reported to the
police. If that is so, roughly 1.5m bicycles are stolen in
America every year. A recent study in Montreal found

that half of all cyclists have had bicycles stolen. This is
in part because stealing bicycles piecemeal is oddly
easy; the loot itself provides the getaway.
Given that such thefts are typically discovered ex-
actly when the bike is needed, the crime is an urgently
irksome one—and one which plays a signiﬁcant part in
stopping people from cycling, or giving the pastime up.
According to that Montreal study 7% of victims never
replace their bikes at all. Your correspondent vividly
remembers both the thrill of getting a brand new BMX
for his 13th birthday and the heartache of having it sto-
len 11 days later. It was well over a decade before he
owned another bike. 
Such thefts are not just privations; they are tempta-
tions. In Vittorio De Sica’s neorealist classic, “Bicycle
Thieves” (1948), the bike that a working-class man de-
pends on for his livelihood is stolen. In a moment of
weakness, he tries to steal another bike, and is humili-
ated in front of his son. “Beijing Bicycle” (2001), direct-
ed by Wang Xiaoshuai, told a similar story; an upward-
ly mobile striver tries lifting a bike after his own goes
missing. He is dragged oﬀ to the police station. 
One of the fundamental attractions of shared bikes is that they
breach such chains of theft and temptation. There will always be a
bike when you need it, regardless: no property, no theft. That was
the insight which, in 1989, led Ole Wessung to reinvent Provo’s
idea. Standing in front of the empty space on a Copenhagen pave-
ment where his bike should have been, he found himself consid-
ering taking someone else’s cycle to replace it. It was the ﬁfth bike
he had had stolen in three months. Instead, he walked home turn-
ing over a new idea in his mind. Maybe insurance companies
could be persuaded to sponsor a free-bike scheme so that they
would not have to pay out for as many thefts.
They couldn’t. But, slowly, the city authorities were. The “By-
cyklen” scheme, as it was called, took until 1995 to get rolling (Mr
Schimmelpennink, whose post-Provo attempts to get Dutch poli-
ticians to buy into bike-sharing had met with little success, was a
consultant on the project). When it did, its success had three cru-
cial elements. The ﬁrst was oﬃcial involvement. Where the Pro-
vos worked in opposition to the city council, Bycyklen had the
support of not just the Copenhagen municipality but the minis-
tries of tourism, environment and culture as well.
Second, Bycyklen recognised that a bike is a canvas for com-
merce. It roped in corporate sponsors, including Coca-Cola and
the Danish Girl Scouts, to advertise on the bikes. Last, and perhaps
most important, the bikes were specially designed to be less at-
tractive to thieves. Their parts would not ﬁt on a standard bike.
They were also rather ugly.
The bikes were free, but had a rudimentary deposit system
modelled on supermarket trolleys. Riders inserted a 20 kroner ($3)
coin to unlock a bike from one of the stands where they were
housed; they got it back when they docked it at another. This was
not much of a deterrent to abuse. Upon ﬁrst encountering the
bikes in 2005, your correspondent rode one far outside its desig-
nated zone and lugged it up four ﬂights of stairs before, confronted
by his mortiﬁed host, he took it back down again and abandoned
it on a grassy verge.
Despite such deviant behaviour by a feckless few,
Bycyklen was something of a success. Bike thefts fell
from 27,000 in 1989, when Mr Wessung conceived of
his plan, to just under 18,000 in 1997, two years after the
scheme got going. The ugly bikes stayed on Copenha-
gen’s streets until 2012, when the city replaced the old
clunkers with a ﬂeet of spiﬀy e-bikes. 
Bycyklen inspired a handful of similar eﬀorts. But
the trend was slow to grow. Amid some successes (by
the mid-2000s many German cities had such
schemes) there were many let-downs. Failure often

came from not making the bikes suﬃciently unattrac-
tive and thus providing a resource for thieves, rather
than an alternative to stealing. The “green bike”
scheme started in Cambridge, England’s most cycling-
friendly city, in 1993 had most of its bikes nicked by the
end of the ﬁrst weekend. In Portland, Oregon in 1994
two friends, inspired by a passage about Provo’s white
bikes in a documentary, gathered some bicycles and
painted them yellow. The bikes quickly vanished.
They put more on the street. More disappeared. Other
cities tried, too: Spokane (purple), Madison (red), Boul-
der (green), Tampa (orange), Minneapolis (yellow),
Fresno (yellow). All failed, writes Peter Jordan in his
book, “In the City of Bikes”, which tells the story of cy-
cling in Amsterdam and elsewhere.
What was needed was a high-proﬁle, well-de-
signed scheme big enough to weather endemic larce-
ny and mounted by someone determined to make a
go of it. That was what Paris provided in 2007, when
on the day after Bastille Day Bertrand Delanoë, the
mayor, inaugurated Vélib. Not everyone thought this
wise. “Paris n’est pas Amsterdam,” Le Monde, a news-
paper, had sniﬀed the day before. This turned out to be
true, but not the way the paper meant it. Where Am-
sterdam’s ﬁrst scheme had failed, Vélib was a triumph.
That was in part because Mr Delanoë did not just
want to convert existing cycle owners into cycle shar-
ers; he wanted more people cycling. Paris had added
261km of bike lanes between 2001 and 2007. “They
were rebuilding the city to be friendlier to bikes...at a
massive scale and rapid speed,” says Kate Fillin-Yeh of
America’s National Association of City Transporta-
tion Oﬃcials. Bike-sharing works best when matched
with a good infrastructure network, she says: call it a
virtuous cycle.

Holding back the gears
Mr Delanoë had also learned from Copenhagen. In-
stead of spending city money, the mayor oﬀered 1,628
outdoor-advertising spaces to JC Decaux, an advertis-
ing company which had experience with a similar, but
much smaller, scheme in Lyon, if it would operate the
scheme. Unlike Copenhagen’s the system was not
free; but it was cheap, and credit cards and electronic
docking stands made it convenient. New embedded
sensors made the bikes easier to track and helped iden-
tify patterns of use.
None of this stopped enterprising thieves; 3,000
bikes were stolen in the ﬁrst year alone, far more than
expected. But that did not stop citizens and tourists
alike clocking up 27.5m rides over the same period. Cit-
ies around the world—including London—decided the
idea’s time had come. “Paris is a city people pay atten-
tion to in a way they don’t to Lyon,” says Ms Fillin-Yeh.
In the 12 years before Vélib some 75 bike-share
schemes were set up. In the ten years since nearly
1,600 have come on line, according to a database main-
tained by Russell Meddin of bikesharingmap.com (see
chart). 
For all this eventual success, bike-sharing has done
little to curtail the “asphalt terror of the motorised
bourgeoisie”, as Provo had promised. Bike-sharing
rides typically replace journeys made on foot or using
public transport, not journeys in cars. Resources for
the Future, a think-tank, found that the system in
Washington, DC has had only a “marginal impact” on
congestion. That said, the think-tank reckons that the
4% drop in congestion it found saves $182m a year in

shorter travel times and less need to buy fuel.
Health beneﬁts are harder to quantify, especially in smoggy cit-
ies like Beijing. Mobike has found that its bikes are used more or
less as much when the air is really bad as when it is not, suggesting
that the good done by exercise may be undone by heavy breathing
in toxic air. But in less-polluted cities the gains from exercise are
larger than the risks from road accidents or air pollution, according
to a study of Barcelona in the British Medical Journal.

Back on the chain gang
As for ownership, the rise of Mobike and Ofo suggests, at the mo-
ment, that it is venture capitalists (or, eventually, shareholders)
who will own the urban bicycles of the future. Public bike-share
systems, even with the generous support of advertisers, have rare-
ly been able to cover all their costs. But executives at both Ofo and
Mobike insist that their smartphone-based dockless business
models are sound. If they stopped expanding tomorrow, they say,
their balance sheets would be a sea of black.
As it is, both give away free rides to attract and retain riders and
are engaged in a bloody war for market share. Their investors are
keen for them to merge. Analysts from Hong Kong to New York are
sceptical they can make money selling rides for 1 yuan even as the
companies insist that they can. But they could in time add to their
revenues by turning their bike networks into data generators, cre-
ating a new way of deﬁning the city’s pulse (see map of London).
Digital companies already know a lot about online behaviour;
bikes help them track oﬀ-line behaviour, too. Bike pick-up and
drop-oﬀ data can show which shops and cafés are most popular—
and whether online ads have had any eﬀect on oﬀ-line behaviour. 
Mobike says it does not share data commercially. But it is work-
ing with think-tanks, universities, research institutes and the
World Bank to put bikes and the information they provide about
their users and environment at the service of better city-planning.
Such systems could yet cut emissions and congestion and make
the world’s cities more pleasant places to live.
Dockless bike-share schemes, however, bring with them a new
and unprecedented problem: bicycles so numerous that even
theft cannot keep the streets clean of them. The things pile up in
parks, courtyards, alleyways and any available open space, often
dumped carelessly on top of each other, sometimes making it diﬃ-
cult for pedestrians to walk down a street unimpeded. At least sev-
en major Chinese cities have stopped allowing any new shared
bikes on their streets. In August Wandsworth, a London borough,

seized dozens of bikes dumped on its streets by oBike,
a Singaporean ﬁrm. Singapore itself impounded 135
bikes earlier this summer. Amsterdam, true to form
(and with such high bike-ownership rates that it sees
no need to promote yet more bicycling) has banned
dockless bike-share. 
Still, some in the Netherlands still dream of making
bikes ever more free—creating a system in which bikes
are not owned by people, or cities, or by companies us-
ing them as data-sources, but by themselves. Marcel
Schouwenaar, a Dutch designer, has a plan called Fair-
bike which gives bikes blockchains. Blockchains, the
software innovation that makes cryptocurrencies pos-
sible, are distributed ledgers which keep untampera-
ble records of actions and transactions. Mr Schouwe-
naar thinks that the “smart contracts” blockchains
allow—agreements that can monitor the fulﬁlment or
breach of any conditions they stipulate—could create
self-managing ﬂeets of bikes.
Using Fairbike would be like using Mobike. But in-
stead of passing on your money to a central organisa-
tion, the bikes would hold on to it. Once a community
set such a system up it would pay for its own mainte-
nance—and, when enough funds had been collected,
new bikes. Systems used a lot could thus both heal
their wear and tear and increase their population. The
repair jobs and new bike orders would be assigned on
a lottery basis to registered bike shops. Theft would ﬁ-
nally become impossible, at least technically; wherev-
er a Fairbike was taken it would still own itself. There
would, however, be a certain loss of access.
Mr Schouwenaar hopes to pilot Fairbike next sum-
mer in Rotterdam, friendlier to such schemes than Am-
sterdam. But he respects the idea’s heritage. “We try to
get very close to the original Provo bikes in Amster-
dam,” he says. The idea is to bring together the ideal-
ism and bottom-up approach of the Dutch anarchists
and the technological advances of the Chinese mega-
ﬁrms. Bicycles of the world: unite! You have every-
thing to gain from your blockchains! *

D E E P S P R I N G S , C A L I F O R N I A A N D S I T K A , A L A S K A

I N THE spring of 1916 Lucien Lucius
Nunn, a businessman in his early 60s,
set oﬀ from Los Angeles in an open-top
Stanley automobile. He chuntered north-
eastward through Owens Valley, in the
shade of the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo
mountains, which the Paiute tribe named
as the “dwelling place of a great spirit”.
After some 300 miles he emerged from a
gap known as Westgard Pass and gazed
down at Deep Springs Valley, an area twice
the size of Manhattan. Nunn had spent his
life searching for a place like this. “The des-
ert has a deep personality,” he said. “It has
a voice.” And he wanted some of the best
young men in America to hear it.
A century later, they are still listening.
Founded by Nunn a year after his visit,
Deep Springs is perhaps the most isolated
and most selective small university in the
world. It still functions roughly as Nunn
imagined. Every year it admits just a dozen
or so undergraduates, who spend two
years there. They take classes, they help to
govern the college, and they work on its
cattle ranch and alfalfa farm. 
At ﬁrst glance, Deep Springs can seem
like a chance for privileged young men to
play cowboys before transferring to an Ivy
League university, as many do. But it is
more than an extended summer camp for
posh, oﬀbeat clever-clogs. It is a rare coun-
terpoint to a mainstream model of higher
education that is under increasing strain.
Deep Springs has never charged fees,
while the cost of tuition at private Ameri-
can universities has tripled in real terms
since 1976. (About half of students with
loan debt say the cost was not worth it, ac-
cording to Pew Research Centre, a pollster.)
And Deep Springs is committed to an edu-
cation that develops its students as individ-
uals and as members of a community in a
way few other institutions can match. 
The college has hewn to Nunn’s princi-
ples to a degree that can seem archaic. As it
looks back on 100 years, though, it is start-
ing to embrace change. After a century
only admitting young men, next year it will admit female students
for the ﬁrst time. Meanwhile, a small band of Deep Springs alumni
and devotees is establishing a similar college in Sitka, a town in
south-east Alaska. One development asks if Nunn’s idiosyncratic
vision can be broadened; the other asks if it can be reproduced.
Will the voice of the Alaskan wilderness be as wise a teacher as
that of the desert? 
By the time he founded Deep Springs, Nunn had held stakes in
gold mines, newspapers and banks (one of which was robbed of
more than $22,500 by Butch Cassidy in 1889). But hydroelectric
power made his fortune. Alongside Nikola Tesla and George Wes-
tinghouse, Nunn pioneered the use of alternating current to trans-
mit electrical power over long distances. One business associate

noted that there had seldom been such a bundle of en-
ergy wrapped up in such a small amount of skin. At
about ﬁve feet tall (150cm), Nunn was almost half a
foot shorter than Napoleon, whose relentless zeal he
admired. 
Another colleague recalled that Nunn saw work as
“the one cure for worry and grief”. He knew both well.
Nunn’s twin brother, Lucius Lucien, had died at the age
of three. The loss would haunt him; he always referred
to himself by their shared initials. Nunn also had to
live with the social constraints around his homosex-
uality. (He was “forever getting crushes on pink-
cheeked hotel bellboys”, one local gossip allegedly re-

marked). And in 1910 he was diagnosed
with tuberculosis, with which he would
battle until his death in 1925. 
Nunn saw himself as a builder of men.
In 1891 he set up a scheme whereby his best
engineers worked at remote power sta-
tions while taking classes that enabled
them to apply to elite universities. In 1912
he sold his stake in the power company
and devoted the rest of his life to establish-
ing a college which would put into practice
his ideas about education. 
Those ideas reﬂected how Nunn him-
self had learnt. An alumnus of Oberlin
College and Harvard Law School who
built miners’ cabins as part of an early busi-
ness, Nunn felt men should engage in prac-
tical tasks as well as intellectual ones. It
was an idea reinforced by reading theolo-
gians such as Johann Herder and Charles
Finney, as well as Thomas More’s “Utopia”,
in which the philosopher imagined how
collective farm work stops the rise of nar-
cissism in his idealised community. 
Some scholars suggest Nunn’s belief in remoteness came from
reading “Love Labour’s Lost”, the Shakespeare play in which the
King of Navarre and his companions vow to isolate themselves.
But it was also inﬂuenced by his attempt to set up a university in
Claremont, Virginia, in 1916. It shut a year later, after the students
complained about too much farm work and Nunn had to pay oﬀ
one too many pregnant local women. 
His ideas were also shaped by his era. “Progressive” education-
alists such as John Dewey were criticising universities for expand-
ing on an industrial scale while neglecting to instil character and
purpose in students. Nunn wanted his students to take on “the
burden of leadership” in “service to humanity”. Such sentiment
may sound like the vacuous “mission statements” of today’s uni-
versities. But Nunn took them seriously. He was an elitist as well as
an altruist. Inﬂuenced by Cecil Rhodes, the mining magnate and
scholarship-founder, Nunn believed “the mass [of people] is dull-
witted, sluggish, incapable”. He was looking for the “score in 100
million” who could lead. 

Twice upon a time in the West
Deep Springs has since produced an impressive roster of scholars,
diplomats, scientists and writers (and a disproportionately small-
er share of bankers and consultants than other elite institutions).
Though it has produced fewer alumni in an entire century than
Harvard takes in undergraduates in a year, they include several
Rhodes scholars as well as winners of the Pulitzer and MacArthur
“Genius” prizes. 
One evening in late September your correspondent arrived at
Deep Springs, after a four-hour drive from Las Vegas, to meet its
current class. It was dinner time; the dining room smelled of burn-
ing ﬁrewood and an indiﬀerence to showering. Nunn’s portrait
looked down from the far wall. Most students had a shamboli-
cally rustic look: boots, jeans, oversized checked shirts and dishev-
elled hair. 
Aadit Gupta, a ﬁrst-year, explained that Deep Springs was “a
way of escaping the trajectory I was on”. Born in India to diplomat
parents, he saw his peers drifting through elite colleges and wan-
dering unthinkingly into ﬁnance or consulting. He wanted a chal-
lenge. Says another student, Nkosi Gumede, “It was just weird
enough for me and not too weird for my parents.” 
Every student spends 15-20 hours a week doing such jobs as
dishwasher, cook, gardener, irrigator or dairy boy—such manual
labour being one of the college’s “three pillars”. Their work helps
keep tuition and board free, but the main aim is to build a sense of

responsibility. For Paul Starrs, who enrolled in 1977 and
is now a professor of geography at the University of
Nevada, the labour programme “presented a hum-
bling, heroic and often embarrassing reality” for hith-
erto high-achievers. Slopping pigs and bucking bales
of hay rarely comes easy.
As he milks Vera the cow, Hussain Taymuree, a sec-
ond-year, explains that “work is the obligation you ful-
ﬁl for the rest of the community.” He could work just
the minimum hours per week and provide milk, he
says, or work harder and make ice-cream, ricotta and
yogurt. Work has helped him grasp how his actions af-
fect the happiness of others. 
The second pillar, self-governance, has a similar ef-
fect. Student-body meetings (pictured above) take
place on Friday afternoons, when students at conven-
tional universities might be playing beer pong. At
these gatherings students set the rules by which they
live. One recent decision was to try banning the use of
the internet. 
Over the century the student body has had its share
of diﬃculty and scandal. In the 1930s the wife of the
head rancher had an aﬀair with the dean, whose wife
was sleeping with a student. (The rancher was busy
rustling cattle.) In the 1940s the college’s trustees limit-
ed the intake of Jews, against the wishes of most stu-
dents. A decade later the director of the college was a
paranoid McCarthyite who allegedly reported those
he suspected of Communist sympathies to the FBI. 
Students play a role in choosing both their teach-
ers—some of whom are alumni—and the students who
will follow them. Applications “will be scrutinised
and debated with a diligence bordering on monoma-
nia”, according to David Arndt of the class of 1984. Ap-
plicants submit about seven essays and usually place
among the top 2% in SATs, the national test used for
university admission. Just 6-8% of them are accepted.
Throughout the 20th century the vast majority of stu-
dents were white and wealthy, many from private
schools. Today most students are still aﬄuent but they
are more diverse: in the past ﬁve years 30% have been
people of colour, according to the college. Many of
those are international students, however. Very few
students are African-American or Latino.

teaching by academics who would rather do research. 
Like Deep Springs, Outer Coast will be a small, two-
year college and involve labour and self-government.
But the work will be for community organisations, not
a ranch. And while Sitka’s surroundings are wild and
beautiful, Outer Coast will not be isolated, as Deep
Springs is. Nor will it be free, though it will try to oﬀer
scholarships to those with indigenous heritage. 
Outer Coast will be co-educational from the start.
But at Deep Springs the question of whether to admit
women has hung without ﬁnal resolution for decades.
There have been two main reasons cited for staying
stag. One is distraction. Nunn warned his students
against “entangling alliances”, and though there have
been gay relationships between students over the
years, some alumni recall the 1980s, when sex among
students, staﬀ and faculty became commonplace, as a
toxic time. The other is dilution; that special depth of
camaraderie will be lost, not least because students
will show oﬀ more. 
Supporters of the move, including most current stu-
dents, believe it is a simple matter of equality. In 2011
the university’s board of trustees voted 10-2 in favour
of admitting women, and in 2017 California’s Supreme
Court ruled in the majority’s favour after a legal chal-
lenge. Although it will make the college even more se-
lective (since class size will remain the same), the new
student body should not change the ability of Deep
Springs to be an implicit critique of the surrounding
culture. It is simply too remote and too unusual to re-
vert to the mean. There is every chance that the young
men and women who arrive in 2018 will, like most of
their predecessors, take pride in applying Nunn’s ide-
als. One of the ironies of Deep Springs is that, although
each class gets to make the school anew, they tend to
keep it much the same. The voice of the desert is still
ringing in their ears. *

“Three pillars,
two ground rules,
one valley”

The responsibility given to students is one reason
why Christopher Breiseth, a former Deep Springs pres-
ident, wrote in 1981 that the college had a “subtle con-
servatism”. As another alumnus explains: at other col-
leges the anti-establishment student can rage against
the system, but “at Deep Springs you discover you are
the establishment”.
Student body meetings are also a crucible in which to apply
the ideas learned in the academic programme, the college’s third
pillar. Nunn stipulated that students must learn public speaking
and composition. The rest is mostly up to them. Recent subjects in-
clude immunology, economic development, Dostoyevsky, Plato,
Marx, Durkheim and—perhaps naturally for a group of rustic
Übermenschen—Nietzsche. 
There is an endearing sincerity to the Deep Springs student.
Most speak slowly and deliberately, and eschew small talk. They
walk slowly, too, ambling around the central circle comprising the
university’s low-rise dorms and buildings. It is not uncommon to
hear them say things such as: “The world we live in is very Straus-
sian”, or “Imagine what Ibn Khaldun would say”. Such lines are
delivered with only a little performance. “Things here are so much
more genuine than at my high school”, says Arman Aﬁﬁ, a second-
year student from California. “People are interested in the texts for
their own sake.” During lectures students are engaged, not on
phones or laptops. Debates end in class and begin again in the
boarding houses. 
The Deep Springs experience is intensiﬁed by two rules Nunn
laid down for the university. The ﬁrst is no drinking or drug-taking.
The second is isolation: students cannot receive visitors or leave
the ranch. That way the eﬀect of the desert is heightened. “In the
city you’re surrounded by things in front of you,” says Mr Aﬁﬁ.
“The desert makes you more aware of yourself.”
“Three pillars, two ground rules, one valley,” writes Cory My-
ers, a recent graduate, in a book commemorating the centenary. “If
Deep Springers are reactants, these are the catalysts.” “It’s not al-
ways enjoyable,” says Timothy Olsen, a second-year. “But we’re
not here for comfort.” Students concede Deep Springs can take an
emotional toll, but most like that it makes them think about what
they want from life. What every student appears to cherish above
all is the relationships with classmates. At his high school pupils
were always jostling for social status, notes Mr Aﬁﬁ. At Deep
Springs “relationships are much more genuine and intimate”. 
For 37-year-old Bryden Sweeney-Taylor, who now works for an
education charity, Deep Springs was “the formative experience of
my life”. The college was rarely easy but it gave him the compan-
ionship he craved, and encouraged him to reﬂect deeply on what
he wanted to do with his life, opting ultimately to work in educa-
tional reform. By contrast, Harvard, where he transferred after two
years, “was a let-down”. Yet Mr Sweeney-Taylor feels that Deep
Springs has been too inward-looking. So, together with some col-
leagues, he is setting up Outer Coast, a new university due to open
in Alaska in the autumn of 2020. 

Is this place at your command?
The fact that today Deep Springs stands almost alone would have
disappointed Nunn, who wanted it to inspire imitators and inno-
vators. But it is diﬃcult to set up a new university, explains David
Neidorf, the current president. Obtaining credentials is a bureau-
cratic nightmare. Philanthropists want to give to their alma mater,
not a new college. 
That has not deterred the Outer Coast team. Jonathan Kreiss-
Tomkins, who came up with the idea for a college, grew up in Sitka
and dropped out of Yale in 2012 to run, successfully, for the Alaska
House of Representatives (he won re-election in 2014 and 2016).
He sees Outer Coast as a way to rejuvenate both his hometown
and the current model of higher education. Much as Nunn was in
1917, the team is frustrated with what Mr Sweeney-Taylor calls the
“hollow nature” of today’s university life, and the poor quality of

The West Wind

A moving air, from Homer to Shelley 

The Water is Wide, Akraberg: Alex Boyd

AMID all the poetic riches of English literature, four short
lines stand out. They are anonymous, as are almost all the
songs, carols and ballads that ﬁll the earliest pages of an-
thologies. But once read, they are not soon forgotten: 

Westron wynde, when wilt thou blow,
the small raine down can raine.
Cryst, if my love were in my armes
and I in my bedde again.

Almost everything about these lines is mysterious. The mystery
begins with their power. They are not elegant; purists would say
that the grammar fractures between the ﬁrst line and the second,
requiring a “so that” to link the “blow” and the “can”. As they
stand, the wind and the small (that is, drizzling) rain are connected
but disconnected, as if these are really two separate thoughts. But
then the dreamy stream of consciousness suddenly resolves with
a third idea: the weather may do what it likes, but what really mat-
ters is making love, and if only it could be now; right now. 
And when is “now”? Another of the poem’s mysteries is the
time and the season. Traditionally, the mild West Wind that
brought soft rain was an indicator of spring; but the last two lines
suggest a cosy hunkering down against something colder and
more wintry. To some, the strong sense of waiting suggests that

this is an Advent poem; yet that is to conﬂate Christ
and love in a way that the words clearly do not intend. 
It could in truth be set in any month of the year. In
western Europe this is the prevailing wind, and brings
almost any weather. Only intense heat, intense cold or
drought are the exclusive preserve of winds from other
quarters. Walkers who fear they are unprepared are al-
ways watching the west for those ﬁrst intimations of
bulking clouds and rain. But the warm breeze of a ﬁne
day can be western, too. That ﬁckle character is a large
part of the story. 
A third mystery is place. To some readers, the dip
and sway of the ﬁrst line suggests a boat on the sea,
and perhaps a sailor longing for home or a woman
awaiting him. It was the West Wind which, in the “Od-
yssey”, began to blow Odysseus home. But sailors on
an open ship, whose coarse canvas sails will only get
heavier with a wetting, do not also long for rain, small
or large. This seems more like a landsman’s longing,
for rain to fall on ﬁelds and fertilise them. If so, it is a
neat tie from the ﬁrst couplet to the second, a metaphor
of seed-sowing that gainsays the apparent artlessness
of the poet. There is also an almost giddy fall from the

wide heavens where the wind resides to one small, or-
dinary bed: from the diﬀusely vast, to the particular.
The earliest version of this little poem appears in a
collection from about 1530. But it is clearly older, both
in language and in style—probably Middle English. It
seems plausible that “Westron Wynde” began as a folk
lyric in the 14th century and simply lingered in the
popular mind, well-loved enough to end up at the roy-
al court as well as in the taverns. And thus it lived on. 
The words could have survived by themselves, as
sayings and nursery rhymes have done. But they also
had a tune, to ﬁx them more deeply. In fact, they had two. The ﬁrst
appears when the words do, in a partbook for lute; it is nothing
special, and with its clutch of semibreves moves with a dirge-like
tread. The second tune is both livelier and unashamedly beautiful
(see below). It is also more evocative of wind, which sweeps
around on “blow” for several bars before the rain comes in. Much
the same thing happens in Monteverdi’s great madrigal “Zeﬁro
torna” (“The West Wind returns”) of 1632, in which the tenor lines
on the word mormorando, as Zeﬁro rustles among the leaves, goes
on and on and over the page. In that piece too, wandering Zeﬁro
merely sets the stage for the lover to feel even more alone. 
The lovely English tune formed the basis for three masses of
the 16th century, by John Taverner (who may have composed the
tune himself), Christopher Tye and John Sheppard. The notion of
a Western Wind mass is an alluring one, as if the closed and col-
umned space of a chapel were suddenly to open out, through roof
and windows, to the air; or as if the wind were to whistle its way
in, giving the ponderous liturgy a lift. In the event, it does even
more. The tune blows so repeatedly and hauntingly through all
these works (36 times in Taverner’s) that the Latin counts for al-
most nothing. The sacred words do not remotely ﬁt the profane
theme. The music reverts irresistibly to the spine-tingling entry of
the West Wind, as if this is all that matters. 

Angel of rain and lightning
The device of writing masses round a popular song was then well
worn in Europe; “L’homme armé”, from about 1450, inspired more
than 40 of them. What was diﬀerent about “Westron Wynde” was
how exceedingly secular it was. “L’homme armé” exhorted every-
one to put on chain mail and be afraid, very afraid, of an armed
man (possibly St Michael) who was just about to appear. “Westron
Wynde” was most obviously a daydream about sex. It is true that it
evokes Christ; but not in prayer, only in the way that people still
say “Christ!” in the godless 21st century. Indeed, if there is a god in-
voked in this lyric, sighed for and appealed to, it is the West Wind,
which enters in the second tune on the same note as Christ. In the
King James Bible of 1611 it is God who sends, dew-like, “small rain
upon the tender herb”. Not here. 
As gods in Greece, the four principal winds had been a mixed
bunch; and none was more moody or harder to qualify than Zeph-
yrus. According to Hesiod, they shared the same ancestors: all
were the grandchildren of a Titan and the children of dawn and
dusk, when winds tended to rise. Shaggy cloaked Boreas had just
one aspect, which was cold. Icicles hung from his hair, and frost

chapped his hands. Notos, the south wind, was
known for rushing, shouting and storms. Zephyrus,
“the brightener”, had a much more mixed personality.
He also had more wives than his brothers, including
the rainbow Iris. Marriage, though, did not stop him
impregnating mares, according to Virgil in the “Geor-
gics”: sometimes in the guise of a stallion, sometimes
by merely blowing on them. 
Zephyrus appears on the Tower of the Winds in
Athens scattering ﬂowers from his cloak; Homer called
him “the lightest of all things”, softly riﬄing both robes
and water, bringing the swallows. But in that tender as-
pect he tended to get knocked out of the way. In
Homer’s “Odyssey”, the other winds had to be tied up
in an ox-hide bag so that goody-goody Zephyrus could
give Odysseus a gentle glide back to Ithaca; when the
bag was accidentally opened, the other winds sup-
planted him. (In Vivaldi’s “Summer”, as he wanders
round sighing to the songs of turtledoves and cuckoos,
fortissimo Boreas again barges him aside.) In this guise
he was so mild that he was hardly recognisable as the
bringer of really nasty weather, though the Greeks did
speak of his “shrill heels” and “wild blasts”. The dis-
connect in “Westron Wynde” between the West Wind
blowing and the soft rain falling may have been delib-
erate, after all. 
Percy Bysshe Shelley avoided this problem, in his
“Ode to the West Wind”, by having two west winds.
They were brother and sister—which always meant, to
Shelley, complementary parts of a single being. The
azure life-bringer of the spring, blowing “her clarion
o’er the dreaming earth”, was merely the other side of
the brutal force of autumn, ﬁlling the sky with “tumult
of thy mighty harmonies”: 

Thou on whose stream, mid the steep sky’s commotion, 
Loose clouds like earth’s decaying leaves are shed, 
Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,
Angels of rain and lightning.....

“Destroyer and Preserver” was Shelley’s invocation to
this dual personality. It carried echoes of prayers to the
god Shiva, bringer of life and death; this West Wind
had again become a god. 
Shelley wrote his poem as he watched the West
Wind roar through a wood on the banks of the Arno
outside Florence. That wind had been a comrade and a
model since his boyhood, both out on the hills and
“over heaven” where he followed it, equally “tameless
and swift and proud”. He urged it to take him over, to
blow through him and broadcast his words as “the
trumpet of a prophecy” to awaken the Earth political-
ly, socially, sexually and spiritually. None of that could
happen unless the old order was violently swept out
ﬁrst. In one of Shelley’s notebooks the connection is
explicit: in the midst of some dreamy lines to Zephyr,

ing that writers reached for diminutive
“zephyrs”, harmless little breathlings from
the same direction, to evoke the mildest
winds of summer. The full-blown element
is another thing entirely.
He was also sexually ambivalent.
“Westron Wynde” oﬀers no clues either to
the love or the lover: the poem is assumed
to be by a man, but nothing in it makes that
certain. All lovers prey to helpless compul-
sion are blown as if by buﬀeting winds,
and in any direction. The West Wind’s
most notorious action in Greek mythology
was to divert a discus thrown by Apollo so
that it killed the Spartan boy-prince Hya-
cinthus, whom Zephyrus loved, but whom
Apollo had won. From Hyacinthus’s blood
ﬂowers sprang. Zephyrus was saved from
Apollo’s rage by Cupid, but only because
he had acted in the name of love. The price
of this swift intervention was that the West
Wind should serve Love ever after.
Servant and master then became con-
ﬂated. The commands of one often im-
pelled the actions of the other, as when, in
Apuleius’s “The Golden Ass”, Zephyrus
carried the lovely virgin Psyche—“soul”—
into Cupid’s palace. The West Wind was
on his best behaviour here, wafting her to a
meadow ﬁlled with ﬂowers; in some 19th-
century paintings, he is given butterﬂy
wings like hers. He looks a lot like Love
himself, as he does on several vases from
ancient times. Their characters—by turns chilly and
warm, mild and savage—are also much the same. No
wonder “Westron Wynde” moves so seamlessly from
one to the other. 
In one respect, though, they are very diﬀerent. Cu-
pid enslaves with one scrape of his arrows. The West
Wind, in all aspects, is a liberator. He ﬁlls the sails to set
them in motion and softens the land for the grass to
grow; he induces rather than compels love to appear.
And he releases the dead or seemingly dead, stripping
the leaves from the trees, conveying the dormant seeds
to their graves in the earth, in order for new life to
come. He accompanies Psyche through death to the
realms of the immortal as he carries Shelley’s awak-
ened spirit through turbulence to new-made worlds. 
At ﬁrst glance, this cosmic role seems too enormous
for the simple Westron Wynde. But perhaps that ex-
plains the lasting appeal of those four lines: they sum
up, and also transcend, human life. *

“Awakener of the spirit’s ocean”, which are not quite working, he
suddenly bursts into the ﬁrst draft of his great political rallying-cry,
“The Mask of Anarchy”:

As I lay asleep in Italy
There came a voice from over the sea
And with great power it forth led me
To walk in the visions of Poesy.

There was no doubt how that voice, Liberty’s, had reached him;
and no doubt that, unless the wind howled and shouted ﬁrst, 
spirit’s ocean would never wake. “Westron Wynde” observed the
same progression: the wind blew, all else followed. 
Even in his spring-bringing, though, the West Wind could be
rough. In Sandro Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus”, painted around
1480, the wind is a swarthy he-man with the nymph Cloris
(“Greenery”) draped nervously round his waist, her ﬁngers appar-
ently crossed. His puﬃng cheeks are not so much wafting ﬂowers
on Venus as pelting her hard, like rain, as he blows her to the shore.
As in “Westron Wynde”, he makes love present and possible; but
his sharp wings are scaled with dark feathers, like those of a bird
of prey. In Botticelli’s earlier “Primavera” he is even more menac-
ing, a cold blue March wind about to grab Cloris. It is not surpris-

Prince got through this thing called life by playing
a bit of everything—except during his mid-1990s 
dispute with Warner Brothers, when he aban-

The material girl pioneered a new sort of live 
show, focused as much on dancing and 
pyrotechnics as the music. To keep in vogue 
she favoured the stuff that was shiny and new.

Whitney saved her love for the studio, not the 
stage. There were only three years in which 
she played 50 concerts. She still became one 
of the highest-selling artists ever.

has barely changed in decades. New albums just fade away.

During his decades of chronicling the runaway American dream, The Boss
has produced an impressive array of songs he has never included on studio 
albums, but which have often become firm favourites for gig-goers.

The data clearly illustrate 
various features of Dylan’s 
career, including the hiatus 
in touring after his bike 
crash in 1966 and the (brief) 
renunciation of his back 
catalogue after his 
conversion to Christianity in 
1979. Since the start of his 
“Never-Ending Tour” in 1988, 
he has played more than 70 
gigs a year, featuring both 
new songs and old but not, 
these days, any from the 
1980s. He has always played  
cover versions of other 
people’s songs, as well as 
songs of his own not on any 
of his albums (marked here 
as “other tracks”).

The eﬀectofglobalwarmingon anotherfamousnorthernspecies, the reindeer, is, however, less cutand dried. Until recently, researchersthoughtreindeerbeneﬁt, ratherthan suf-fer, from climate change. The lichens, grass-esand shrubstheyeatgrowbetterinwarmersummers, and theirpopulationshave been rising. ButÅshild ØnvikPeder-sen and Jean-CharlesGalletofthe Norwe-gian PolarInstitute (NPI) in Tromsø, whohave been investigatingthe matterin de-tail, argue thatthe beneﬁtsofwarmer sum-mersmaysoon be nulliﬁed bythe counter-vailingconsequencesofwarmerandwetterwinters. The reindeeraround NyÅlesund, a for-merminingtown in south-western Sval-bard thathasnowbecome an Arcticre-search centre, have been a subjectof studyforalmostfourdecades. In particular, re-searchersfrom the NPIhave, since 2000,been lookingatthe eﬀectson the deer ofaphenomenon called “rain-on-snow”. Thishappenswhen itrainsduringwarm spellsin the longArcticwinter. Asthe tempera-ture swingsbackto normal, which can beaslowas-30°Cin thispartofthe world,rainwaterthathaspercolated through thesnowfreezes, forminga thickcrustof icethatsealsoﬀthe tundra below. To examinethe consequences, the NPI’sresearchersalong-term decline in the animals’ weight.Adultfemale reindeerin Svalbard weightoday, on average, 12% lessthan theircoun-terpartsdid in 1994. Thathasbroughtmanyofthem below50kg, which experiencesuggestsisa threshold beyond which theirreproductive successand the survival oftheircalvesdecline sharply.Norisitjustreindeerthatare aﬀected byrain-on-snowevents. DrØnvikPedersen’steam hasfound thatatleastthree otherspecies—ptarmigans(a type ofgrouse), sib-lingvolesand Arcticfoxes—are similarlyhit. The consequencesofrain-on-snoweventscould thus, she argues, cascadethrough the Arcticecosystem. Correlatingthe snow- and ice-depthdata with information from surveysaboutthe animalsthemselves(includingtheirwhereabouts, bodyweights, wintersur-vival rate and reproduction) permitsthe re-searchersto trackthe situation and to de-velop modelsofhowthe local ecosystemworks. In particular, theyare looking fortippingpointsbeyond which rain-on-snoweventscould have irreversible eﬀectson the Arcticfood web. In the shorterterm theirapproach mayhelp preventincidentssuch asthatwhichhappened fouryearsago on the Yamalpeninsula in Siberia. Unlike reindeer inSvalbard, which are wild, Yamal’sareherded bylocal people. These herders lost61,000 oftheirbeaststo starvation afterrainstormsdeluged the region in Novem-ber2013. Ifherdersknewwhich placeswould be hitbadlyon such occasions, theycould then take theiranimalsto less threat-ened areas—or, were thatnotpossible, callup mobile slaughterhousesto kill the deerhumanely, before theylostweight, thusminimisingﬁnancial losses.

In the case oftigersnakes, blue-ringed octopuses, arrow-poi-son frogs, hornetsand manyotherspecies,the warningisthatthe animal carries tox-insthatwill sicken orkill. Thusit wasthatAlfred Russel Wallace, co-inventorof thetheoryofnatural selection and an avid in-sectcollector, proposed thatthe beautiful-lycoloured Pachyrhynchusweevilsofeast-ern Asia and Australia were dangerous. Yet, afterspendinghourstryingto pinthe weevilsonto wooden boardsin his col-lection and eventuallyhavingto use a drillforthe chore, he suggested thatthe threatthe beetleswere warningofwith their col-ourswasnotpoison, butthe presence ofbodyarmourthatwould be impossible forpredatorsto chew. Now, 150 yearsafterWallace proposed thisidea, Chung-PingLin and Lu-Yi Wangofthe National TaiwanNormal University, in Taipei, have tested it.Theyshow, in a paperin the Journal ofEx-perimental Biology, thatWallace wasright.DrLin knewofWallace’sidea and wassurprised, when he conducted a literaturereview, to discoverthatithad never beentested formally. He and MsWangthereforecollected from the wild sixPachyrhynchusweevilsand 78 specimensofan insectivo-rouslizard called Swinhoe’sjapalure. Theythen ran an experiment. Theyused theweevilsto found a breedingcolony. The liz-ardscame from a place uninhabited by Pa-chyrhynchusweevils, so thatthe reptilescould have had no priorexperience ofsuch beetles.Each lizard waskeptwithoutfood in aplasticcage forthree days. Itwasthen pre-sented with a weevil. The lizard had threeminutesto attemptto eatthe beetle beforeitwastaken awayagain. In some cases theweevilswere two monthsold, an age atwhich theirarmoured exoskeleton isfullydeveloped and hardened. In others, theywere newlyhatched from theirpupae andtheirexoskeletonswere still soft. A spectro-scopicanalysisshowed, however, that allwere preciselythe same hue. Halfofthe lizardsattacked the weevilsoon afteritwasintroduced into the arena.Those thatattacked a two-month-old tookonlyone bite before spittingthe insect out.All weevilsso rejected survived the en-counterand wenton to live outthe remain-ingtwo monthsoftheirlivesin the comfortofDrLin’slaboratory.

To check, theyoﬀered lizardsweevilsthathad had theirclawsremoved. Itmade no diﬀerence. Ifthe weevil wasa two-month-old, itgot spatout. Ifitwasa juvenile, itwasdevoured. DrLin and MsWangdid also considerthe possibilitythatmature weevils, unlikenewlyhatched ones, mightcontain orbecoated bya toxicornoxiouscompound.

Human evolution todayAt The Future of Materials Summit in Luxembourg on November 13th-14th, leaders across business, policy, science and academia discussed how advancements in materials are opening up new opportunities for industry to innovate and the challenges around bringing new breakthroughs to scale. Chaired by editors from The Economist, speakers included Xavier Bettel, prime minister of Luxembourg, Dirk Ahlborn, CEO of Hyperloop Transportation Technology; Mike Gascoyne, Formula One designer and engineer; among others.THE FUTURE OF MATERIALS SUMMITA new age for manufacturingADVERTISEMENTNew materials have revolutionised industries from automotive and aerospace to healthcare and construction. Aerospace, for example, has seen a huge impact from innovation in materials science, from wood, to aluminium, to today’s composites.Examples of such developments include nano-augmented materials that are stronger and more conductive, lightweight materials that make transport more fuel-e(cid:31)  cient and polymers made from renewable sources. In addition to their usefulness, these advances are also addressing environmental challenges. As Anatoly Chubais, chairman, RUSNANO, put it: “The role of new materials has been seriously underestimated. They can help solve both the issue of climate change and resource depletion.”But despite the benefits, developing new materials is a slow process. Participants argued for more encouragement and collaboration. Scientists should be supported in blue-sky research, while also working with industry to address specific challenges. Materials informatics will help speed up discovery and development, but an open-source approach would also be useful with the caveat that intellectual property needs to be protected.  Speakers argued that materials development must ensure that new materials not only meet our needs now, but do not have a detrimental impact on our future. This should take into account the whole value chain, starting with raw materials through to processing, manufacturing, consuming and recycling. “If we can solve that conundrum and create consumers products that are better performing, cost-efficient and have a better environmental footprint, we could have a big impact on the value chain,” said Michael Saltzberg, global business director, DuPont Industrial Biosciences.FROM THE SPONSOR“Tomorrow´s winning companies will emerge from disruptive ideas that are focused on improving consumers lives and solving societal problems. New materials will play a very fundamental role in resolving those challenges. For example, by combining material science by combining material science, green technologies, connectivity and design, Ujet will reinvent the electric lifestyle experience with mobility solutions that will empower communities desiring to live in more sustainable cities.”Hugues Despres, CEO of Ujet International and VP of Ujet Group, OCSiAl spin o(cid:31) Founding sponsor:112ScienceandtechnologyThe EconomistDecember23rd2017The growth of wine glassesCheers!IN1674 George Ravenscroft, an Englishglassmerchant, wasgranted a patentforthe discoverymade athisfactory inLondon thataddinglead oxide to themeltresulted in a clearer, more durableproduct.

DrMarteaususpectedthatglasseshave gotbiggerovertheyears, and thatthismayhave contributedto the increased drinkingofwine inBritain—an increase thathasbeen partic-ularlymarked in recentdecades.Astheyreportin the BMJ, a medicaljournal, she and herteam obtained dataon glassvolumesgoingbackto about1700 from sourcesincludingthe RoyalHousehold (which buysa newsetforeach monarch) and the Ashmolean, theuniversitymuseum ofCambridge’sarch-rival, Oxford. Altogether, they re-corded the capacityof411glassesand, asthe chartshows, there hasindeed been anear-continuoustendencyforthatcapac-ityto increase since Ravenscroft’sday(hedied in 1683). There isalso a notableacceleration ofthe processstarting inabout1990. In all, the average capacity ofawine glassincreased from 66ml in the1700sto almost450ml in 2016-17.Thatthisvolumetricinﬂation hasstimulated wine consumption—DrMar-teau’ssecond hypothesis—ishard toprove. Butitmayhave done. The amountofwine drunkin Britain hasrisen morethan sevenfold since 1960, while thepopulation hasgrown byonly25%. Datacollected between 1978 and 2005 byBritain’sOﬃce ofNational Statisticssuggestthe proportion ofadultsdrinkingwine fell from 60% to 50% overthatper-iod, while the average weeklywineconsumption ofthose who did drinkthestuﬀtripled, when measured asunits ofalcohol. Anothersetofdata, collected bythe Institute ofAlcohol Studies, a temper-ance charity, suggestthatthe amount ofalcohol from all sources(measured aspure ethanol) consumed perhead inBritain isaboutthe same asitwas in 1980,though ithasﬂuctuated quite a bit in theinterveningyears, peakingin 2004.Meanwhile, workdesigned to testdirectlythe idea thatglasssize matters,which DrMarteaupublished lastyear,produced mixed results.

Ac-cordingly, MrSlezkine startswith a dis-claimer: “Thisisa workofhistory. Any re-semblance to ﬁctional characters, dead oralive, isentirelycoincidental.” Itisand it isnota coincidence. Russia’s20th centurywasimbued with literaryqualities, in partbecause itsactorsoften modelled theirliveson books. Literature wasessential tothe revolution—asitisin MrSlezkine’swork. The revolution wasfounded on abook—Karl Marx’s“DasKapital”. Manyofitsmaster-builderswere men ofletters andbinge-readersofRussian and world clas-sics, aswell asofMarx.Russia’sfast-urbanisingsocietywasﬁlled with the anticipation ofa new era inthe early20th century. “The distantsoundofa broken string”, which Anton Chekhovdescribed in a stage direction to “The Cher-ryOrchard” in 1904, grewonlylouderoverthe followingdecade. “Humanityisad-when he wastaken to the mausoleum on atrip byhisSovietschool.

Lenin urged the workersto launch“thatspecial warthathasalwaysaccompa-nied notonlygreatrevolutionsbuteverymore orlesssigniﬁcantrevolution in his-tory, a warthatisuniquelylegitimate andjust, a holywar”. The chemicalsused to preserve Lenin’sbodywere made in a plantpowered bygu-laglabour. Itwaspartofthe ﬁve-year-planthatStalin launched in 1928, alongwith col-lectivisation which consigned swathes ofthe countryto famine. While peasantchil-dren were reduced to eatingtheirdead sib-lings, the enforcersofcollectivisationdined on sucklingpigand theirwives rep-rimanded servantswho spilled the gravy. Atthe same time ascollectivising thevillages, the Sovietgovernmentpursuedcollectivisation ofthe mind. Aleksandr Se-raﬁmovich, a residentofthe house, wrote“The Iron Flood”, an exemplarysocialist-realistnovel. When he wentbackto hishome town in Kuban (which wasrenamedafterhim), he wasgreeted byyoungpio-neersand presented with earsofgrain asasymbol oftheirharvest. An old starvingrelative begged him (in vain) to send herfood—“I have oakbarkmixed with chaﬀ”—and 70 roublesforherfuneral. Itisnotknown ifhe replied.In 1934, asthe PartyCongressdeclared a“complete and ﬁnal victory”, the FirstCon-gressofWritersannounced thatsocialistrealism wasthe dominantstyle ofSovietliterature. One ofitsdeﬁningfeatures wasoptimism, based on the beliefthatanyconﬂictmustbe resolved, anymistake cor-rected. Optimism wasinfectiousand per-vasive, asisclearfrom the lettersof TatianaMiagkova, anotherresidentofthe house.An economistbytraining, Miagkovawasarrested in 1933 and sentto a “politicalisolator” in the Uralswhere she studied“DasKapital” and cried with joywhen sheread aboutSovietpolarexpeditionsandparades. An intelligentand beautiful 35-year-old woman, who wasseparated fromherfamilyand who lostherhairand teeth,she wrote to hermother: “Itisso good to beacitizen ofthe USSR, even ifyouare tem-porarilyconﬁned to an isolator.” She want-ed herdaughterto be broughtup in thecommunistfaith. Hermother, an old Bol-shevik, keptStalin’sportraiton the walleven afterMiagkova’sexecution in 1937. The purgesofthe 1937-39 were a witch-hunt. Stalin needed scapegoats, and hisshowtrialsprovided them. Anyattempt torefute false chargesdeﬁed the party’swilland thusconﬁrmed guilt. AsNikolai Buk-harin, a close Lenin ally, wastold duringhisown trial, hisjob was“to confessandrepent, notto argue”. Afterten monthsinjail and on the verge ofexecution, Bukha-rin wrote to Stalin: “Myconscience isclearbefore younow, Koba. I askyouone ﬁnaltime foryourforgiveness(onlyin yourheart, nototherwise).”Bolshevism asa violentsectarianmovementended with the death ofStalin,“the personal embodimentofmind andwill ofthe party”, asBukharin describedhim. Itlasted justone generation and wasfatallyundermined, in MrSlezkine’sview,byfamilyand books. Despite the greatterror, mostof the chil-dren ofthe Old Bolshevikshad a happychildhood—oratleastremembered itassuch. Theygrewup with a sense ofentitle-mentand loyaltyto the family.

Crucially, theywere raised on theworksofPushkin and Tolstoy, which theBolshevikshad claimed astheirheritage,alongwith otherclassics. “The Bolsheviksdid notrealise thatbyhavingtheirchildrenread Tolstoy, instead ofMarx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin,” MrSlezkine writes, “theywere dig-gingthe grave ofthe revolution. That byhavingchildren atall theywere digging thegrave ofthe revolution.” No bookwasmore anti-Bolshevikthan “Warand Peace”,which celebrated life and deemed allgrand designsto be vanityand deception.The meaningoflife layin livingit. Life aﬃrmedIn 1937 Daniil Kharms, an absurdistwriter,wrote a storyabouta “thin-necked man”who climbsinto a trunk, shutsthe lid andstartsgaspingforbreath. Atthe end heﬁndshimselfsittingon the ﬂoor, his neckhurting, butfree. “So, life hastriumphedoverdeath bymeansunknown to me,” hesays. Kharmswasexecuted in 1942, attheage of36. Absurd asitseemed atthe time,one daythe “trunk” wasgone and lifebroke through, in the sound and colours ofKhrushchev’sthaw, in ﬁlm and theatre pro-ductionsﬁlled with sincere human feel-ings. People’sneckswere still hurting, buttheywere no longersuﬀocated.In the early1960s, and again in the late1980s, the children ofthe Bolsheviks triedto transform Sovietsocialism into some-thingmore humane, butsoon learned thatitwasimpossible. In the end, asMrSlez-kine writes, “Utopia evaporated…withoutanyone quite noticing.” Soon afterthe So-vietcollapse, a giantMercedesbillboardwasmounted on top ofthe house—a sym-bol ofcapitalisttriumph over“DasKapi-tal”. Today, the house hasa small museumcurated bydescendantsofthe old resi-dents. On the dayyourcorrespondentwentthere, a man from Volgograd (former-lyStalingrad) wasvisiting. Hisgrandfather,who had spent18 yearsin the gulag, threwhimselfoutofthe windowatthe age of 85.“I wantto spiton Stalin’sgrave,” he says. Aformercommunist, he isstill seekingwhathappened to hisfamilyand hiscountry. So,too, isAnatasia, a 26-year-old woman fromStPetersburgwho visited Lenin thinkingabouthergreat-grandfather, who wasexe-cuted in 1918.

inﬂation has also risenfrom the lows caused by the oil pricecrash in late-2014. In Britain prices aregrowing faster than wages. The vote in2016 to leave the European Union ispartly to blame: the pound’s subsequenttumble has made imports dearer, pushingup inﬂation. Rising prices also con-strained real-wage growth in America,despite a plummeting unemploymentrate that has sparked large pay rises insome bits of the economy. Elsewhere,only modest growth is expected.

Hercheekswere too rosy, herteeth were toobig, and she had a habitofchewingherlowerlip when she wasthinking. She hat-ed herbreasts, too. She would much ratherbe a tomboy, ridinga bike withoutbrakesand swimmingwith the local ladsin thegravel pits. She couldn’tunderstand whyherstepfathertried to kissherand put va-pour-rub on herchestwhen she had colds.Butitdidn’ttake herlongto realise that she,Christine Keeler, had a crazyeﬀecton men. She still insisted on hidingherbustwhen she posed forthatphoto, the onethatformillionsofpeople summed up theSwingingSixtiesand sexual liberation inBritain. There she was, naked ornearenough on a fake designerchair. Pouting,daring, glowingwith sexual power. Thewoman whose simultaneousaﬀairswithJohn Profumo, the warminister, and Yev-geni Ivanov, a Sovietnaval attaché, put heratthe cruxofcold-warpolitics. The wom-an the FBIspied on, codename “Bowtie”,and who broughtdown Harold Macmil-lan’sConservative government. Lookingback, itwasstaggeringto contemplate therole she had played in English history. Notthatitalwaysseemed thatway atthe time. She wasa showgirl of17 atMur-ray’sin Soho when she metStephen Ward,who introduced herto Profumo. Forpos-ingtoplessin a red-litdingyroom she got£8.50 a week, which justaboutfed the gasmeter. ButStephen tookherbackto his ﬂatin Bayswater, notto sleep with her, but tooﬀerherround to rich patientsofhis osteo-pathypractice. Straightawayshe becamehiscoﬀeemakerand lethim setthe rules ofherlife. He called her“little baby”, andliked to hearall the detailsofheraﬀairs,though when she protested thatone of hisheavieshad raped herhe didn’tseembothered, aslongasshe had no bruises. Herbeautygave hersuch powerinthose days. She moved in fora while withPeterRachman, the mostnotoriousslumlandlord in London, who showered herwith diamonds. She washispossession,butwhyshould she care? She wasswan-ningthrough high societyhavingmostlylarksand a laugh, so itwasno surprise thatwhen she metProfumo, “Jack” to her, shehappened to be swimmingnaked in LordAstor’spool atCliveden. Theyhad an aﬀairfora month orso. Little did he know thatthe girl he so eagerlythrustto the sofa hadalso sleptwith a Sovietagent! Little did heknowthatStephen wasa spymaster, whoprobablyused herasa decoywhile hestole papersfrom Jack’sbriefcase, andwanted herto winkle outfrom him exactlywhen Sovietnuclearwarheadswere beingmoved to Germany. She could do that, be-cause she knewaboutEast-Westrelations;and ifshe didn’tdo it, itwasonlybecauseshe would notbetrayhercountry. Butno one in the Establishmentbe-lieved hertales, the tall onesoreven thetrue ones. So when Jacktold the House ofCommonshe had no improperacquaint-ance with her, thatwasit. She wasa badgirl, asall girlswere bad who had a bitofsexin those days. She too feltshe was real-lybad at15 when she losthervirginity:damaged goods, and itwasworse still laterwhen she tried to abortherbabywith apen, butwhatcould youdo? Itwasimpos-sible to speakup foryourself. Immoral earningsLord Denning, who wrote the reportonJack’scase, told herto keep quietand be-have. Hisreportsaid there had been no se-curityrisk, and called hera prostitute. Shewasn’t, asshe’d almostneversleptwithmen formoney. Then Jacktold someonethatshe wascompletelyuneducated andcouldn’ttalkaboutanythingexceptmake-up, hairand gramophone records. Well,she mighthave leftschool at15, butshe wasaddicted to crypticcrosswords. She hadprinciples, too, asgood asanybodyelse’s.And she mightbe a tart, asMacmillancalled her, butshe wasn’ta scrubber. Shedressed well and alwayshad style. Worstofall wasthe title the pressfastened on herforeverand everand ever, “vice queen”.All the shame and all the blame. Afterthe whole messcame outin 1963,and Stephen wascharged with livingoﬀimmoral earnings—butkilled himselfbe-fore the verdict—and Jackresigned, she lostall herprotectors. Fora while she hopedherfame mightgetherinto ﬁlms, but hernervousscreen testwentnowhere. Nor didmodellingorjournalism. She had alwayssmoked, butnowshe smoked too much,and keptslidingdown to grottycouncilﬂatsand life on beneﬁts. Rockbottom. Twomarriagesturned outbadly, exceptfor twosons, and even one ofthose grewup es-tranged from her. She supposed she wasprobablytoo insecure to love.Herstrength layin remindingherselfhowpowerful she had been. Overtheyearsshe produced, with help, fourbooks,promotingeach one astruerthan the lastand fullerofspy-detailswhich onlysheknew. From hergreysolitarylife ofcats andbird-feedingand sloppingin shabbyclothesto the shopsshe tookherself backto herglorydaysofinternational impor-tance. Forsexwasjusta game, butspyingwasserious. Although she had to admitthatthe real Christine had disappearedsomewhere alongthe way: perhapsaround the time she had ﬁrstrealised shecould turn men’sheadsin the street, be-cause she wasso beautiful. 7Awoman ofno importanceChristine Keeler, the woman atthe centre ofthe Profumo scandal in the 1960s, diedon December4th, aged 75ObituaryChristine Keelereconomistsubscriptions.com/1843 December 17/January 18 issue of 1843on newsstands now including our Watches & Jewellery  special supplementThe award-winning magazine of ideas, lifestyle and cultureGrit in the oysterHow a bust in the  pearl market led to a burst  of creativityThe Louvre in the desertCan you be addicted to sex?Convicts taming horses The monster under NaplesBoard games 2.0Always one step ahead of the game.HYUNDAI is a registered trademark of Hyundai Motor Company.
