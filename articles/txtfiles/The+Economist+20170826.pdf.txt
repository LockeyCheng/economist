BusinessThe EconomistAugust26th20179LESSthan a decade ago Islamistpartieswere an irresistibleforce in the Middle East. As dic-tatorsquaked in the Arab upris-ingsof2011, these groups, partic-ularlythe Muslim Brotherhoodand itsoﬀshoots, gained inﬂu-ence and seized control. Themosque and the ballotboxseemed to have replaced the pal-ace, the barracksand the secretpolice asa source of power.Butin the wreckage ofthe Arab world today, manyact asifthe idea thatIslamistscan playa useful democraticrole isbro-ken, too. Theyare beingrepressed anewbyreactionary re-gimes, challenged byviolentjihadistsand looked upon withsuspicion byvoterswhom theyfailed. Manyare in jail orexile(see Brieﬁng). Theirmain bankroller, Qatar, isbeing subjectedto diplomaticand economicostracism byitsArab neighbours,with the backingofPresidentDonald Trump. The United ArabEmirates, Saudi Arabia and Egyptare urgingWestern govern-mentsto brand the Muslim Brotherhood asterrorists. When jihadistskill—astheydid again in Spain last week—itisindeed temptingto treatthose who seekpowerin the nameofIslam asa menace. Yetthe blanketrepression ofall Islamistsisthe worstpossible response. In the end, itwill lead onlytomore resentment, more turmoil and more terrorism.Ninety-nine facesIslamistgroupscome in manyforms, from Ennahda, the Tuni-sianswho call themselves“Muslim democrats”, to Hamas, thePalestinianswho dispatched suicide-bombersto Israel. Thosewho would suppressthem all make three errors: theyclaim Is-lamistsare all the same; theysaytheyare fundamentally un-democratic; and theythinkthe solution lieswith strongmen.Startwith the conﬂation. Criticscharge thatpolitical Islam-istsdiﬀerlittle from jihadistslike al-Qaeda and Islamic State,since both sortsofgroupsseekto re-create an Islamic caliphateundersharia and disagree onlyovertimingand means; worse,political Islam isoften a gatewayto violentjihad.The Brotherhood isitselfpartlyto blame forthe blurring ofdistinctions. Itsleadershave a habitofpreachingnon-violencein English while, asoverPalestine and Syria, talking up resis-tance and even jihad in Arabic. Likewise, some ofthe violenceagainstthe Egyptian governmentappearsto be the work ofBrotherhood radicals. Prominentglobal jihadistsinclude ex-Brothers, amongthem Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda’sleader. Butto lump all these groupstogetherissimplistic. Violentji-hadistsdrawon manysourcesto justifytheirgorydeeds, notleastthe puritanical Salaﬁsm ofSaudi Arabia, which competeswith the Brothers. The jihadistsloathe more moderate Islam-istsforfocusingon piety, social servicesand elections. Theythinkman-made lawsare an aﬀrontto divine ones. To treatallIslamistsasjihadistsisa bitlike sayingsocial democrats arejustlike Italy’sRed Brigadesbecause theyall read Karl Marx. Whatofdemocracy? The worryisthateven non-violent Is-lamiststreatelectionsasa tactic: one man, one vote, one time.Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’spresident, wasonce a modelIslamist, easyon religiosityand bigon liberal reforms. Thesedays, ashe purgesreal and imagined foes, he isalmost asawfulasthe Arab dictatorshe once denounced (he keepswinningelections, though). In Egyptthe short-lived Islamist president,Muhammad Morsi, seemed to govern forthe Brotherhoodalone. He installed Brothersthroughoutthe bureaucracy anddeclared himselfto be above the (dubious) judiciary. He alien-ated otherparties, provokingmassprotests.Criticsassume thatMrErdogan and MrMorsi are ﬂawedbecause theyare Islamist. Butthere isanotherexplanation:thattheyhave mimicked the power-grabbingtacticsof Turkishand Egyptian strongmen to pre-empteﬀortsbythe “securitystate” to seize backpower—forMrMorsi, unsuccessfully.Amore hopeful example isTunisia, where the Arab springstarted. Ithasavoided both the chaosofcivil warin Libya, andthe chokehold ofthe secretpolicemen in Egyptand Algeria.Ennahda hashad the good sense to share powerwith moreseculargroups, and even to yield to them. Itknowsthat a frag-ile democratictransition requiresbroad consensus. In Moroc-co the kinghasceded some powerto the parliamentand al-lowed an Islamistprime ministerto lead a broad coalition.The third erroristo thinkthatstatescan deal with the short-comingsofpolitical Islam byrelyingon absolute monarchsand presidents-for-life. Theirrecord isdire. From the Shah’siron rule in Iran thatled to revolution in 1979, through SaddamHussein’sterrorin Iraq, to the coup thatreversed the electoralwinsofIslamistsin Algeria in 1992 and the crushingofprotestsbyBasharal-Assad in Syria in 2011, repression producesatbestabrittle stabilityand atworstcivil war. Unlike former auto-cratsin countriessuch asSouth Korea and Taiwan, most oftheMiddle Eastern oneshave failed to create durable prosperity.NeitherSisi norISISFouryearsafterthe overthrowofMrMorsi, itishard to claimthathe would have been worse than Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, thegeneral who ousted him. MrSisi, nowpresident, carried outthe worstmassacre in modern Egyptian history, killing hun-dredsofMrMorsi’ssupportersin Cairo in 2013. The countryismore repressive than itwasunderHosni Mubarak. Yeta jiha-distinsurgencyragesin Sinai. And MrSisi haslittle idea ofhowto create jobsforEgypt’ssurgingpopulation ofyoungsters. Oppression and misrule setthe scene forthe Arab world’scrisis; theywill notsoon be eradicated. However, autocracy isadead end. Amid the bad choices, the onlywayoutis the gra-dual openingofArab economiesand polities. Thatmeans let-tingideologiescompete, aslongastheyabjure violence and re-spectdemocraticnorms. Competition mustinclude Islamists,because Islam isso central to Middle Eastern society.Often illiberal on everythingfrom the place ofGod in poli-ticsto the role ofwomen, political Islamistsare hardly theChristian Democratsofthe Arab world. Yettheycan be prag-maticand theycannotbe ignored. Ratherthan tryingto crushthem all, which would onlyunite and radicalise them, the aimshould be to workwith moderates, demand thatthe obnox-iousreform, and ﬁghtthe mostdangerous. In thisway Islam-istsmightserve asa roadblockto jihadism, nota path to it. 7Islam and democracyIn a world ofbad choices forthe Middle East, crude repression will make everything worseLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistAugust26th20171“YOUcan lockup ourbo-dies, butnotourminds!”So saysa message posted on theTwitteraccountofJoshua Wong,apro-democracyactivistinHongKong(pictured), shortlyafterhe and two associates weresentto jail on August17th fortheirrolesin the “Umbrella Movement” proteststhatsweptthrough the territoryin 2014. The jail sentences, rangingfromsixto eightmonths, outraged theirsupporters. Tensof thou-sandstookto the streetsin protest(see page 25). Manypeoplein HongKongregard the three mild-mannered, bespectacledmen aspolitical prisoners. The silence ofthe West, particularlythatofBritain, the formercolonial power, isdepressing.The people ofHongKongare rightto be alarmed. The terri-toryisnota democracy. Butitismore open than mainland Chi-na, and itsreputation restspartlyon havinga judiciary thatisrigorousand impartial. Thatiswhyso manyforeigners chooseto live and investthere. Anyerosion ofthe rule oflaw threat-ensHongKong’sprosperity, aswell asthe reputation of China,which promised to respectitslibertieswhen ittookback theterritoryfrom Britain in 1997. Two territories, one systemUnderPresidentXi Jinping, China hassoughtmore overtly tostiﬂe dissentin HongKong. MrXi wasspooked bythe umbrel-la protests, in which thousandsofyoungpeople blocked busystreetsforweeksto pressforgreaterdemocracy. China hassentin agentsto spiritawaypeople itdoesnotlike. Ithas tried to dis-barpro-democracylegislators. And ithasblatantlyput pres-sure on HongKong’sjudges. The three defendantstoday, all in their20s, led the protestsof2014. Two ofthem were convicted lastyearofclamberinginto a governmentcompound duringthe unrest, forwhichtheyreceived community-service sentences. The third wasgiven a suspended jail term forincitingothersto follow them.Butthatwasnotenough forHongKong’sgovernment. Itlodged an appeal, sayingthe men should be jailed. Whetherthe judgesbowed to external pressure isimpossi-ble to tell. Butthere islittle doubtthatHongKong’sgovern-mentpushed fortoughersentencesunderpressure from itsoverlordsin Beijing. Absurdly, the CommunistPartyviews thethree men asdangerousseparatists. Theirjail termsmean theywill notbe allowed to stand in electionsforﬁve years.The verysuspicion thatthe judgesmighthave buckledfeedsthe public’slossofconﬁdence in the rule oflaw, andmakesHongKongmore prone to the kind ofinstability itexpe-rienced in 2014.

Sub-sequentlythey, and then fourothers, includingNathan Law,one ofthe activistsnowjailed, were stripped oftheir seats.China also wantsHongKongto enactlegislation against se-dition and subversion. In 2003 the territory’sgovernmentshelved plansforsuch a bill aftermassprotests. If HongKongagreesto revive thatidea, renewed upheaval isall the morelikely, asresidentswill rightlyfearthatthe newlaw could beused to lockawaypeople forpolitical crimes, and thus turnfree-spirited HongKonginto justanotherChinese city. The CommunistPartymayshrug, asChina isprosperingdespite itsthuggery. Yetthere isa cost.

China is endangering itCENTRALbankershave gath-ered attheirannual shindigin Jackson Hole, Wyoming, forthe pastten yearswith only onethingon theirminds: the healthofthe global economy. Thisyear’sgatheringisdiﬀerent. Thebankers’ preoccupationsarechanging, from recoveryto ﬁnancial stability. Oddly, risingconcern aboutthe risksofﬁnancial excess isgood news. Itreﬂectsthe arrival ofthe ﬁrstsynchronised glo-bal economicupswingsince 2010. GDPgrowth in the quarterendingin June wasthe mostrapid since then, according toJPMorgan Chase, thanksto stronger-than-expected activity inChina, Japan and Europe (Britain wasa notable exception).Anyrelief, however, ismixed with anxietythatthe excesseswhich led to the crisisof2007-08 are again pervasive.

The rate ofnewHIV/AIDSinfectionshasdropped by40%.About7m deathsfrom malariahave been prevented. Yetthere ismuch more to be done. Byone measure, theWorld Health Organisation reckonsabout400m people stillhave no accessto primarycare—the basicform ofmedicinethatshould be atthe forefrontofanywell-run health system.The real ﬁgure isprobablymuch higher. And even for those for-tunate enough to see a general practitioner, ormore usually asemi-trained medicorquack, treatmentisoften dire. The poorstate ofprimarycare will mattereven more astheburden ofdisease in poorcountriescomesto resemble thatinrich ones, shiftingfrom infectiousdiseasesto chronic condi-tions(see page 49). By2020 non-communicable diseaseswillaccountforabout70% ofdeathsin developingcountries. Butthe majorityofpeople with high blood pressure, diabetes ordepression do notgeteﬀective treatment—and maynot evenknowtheyhave a problem. Theydeserve better. Primaryhealth care isnotﬂashy, butitworks. It isthe centralnervoussystem ofa country’smedical services—monitoringthe general health ofcommunities, treatingchronicconditionsand providingday-to-dayrelief. Itcan ensure thatan infectiousdisease doesnotbecome an epidemic. Before the Ebola out-breakof2014, nearlyhalfofLiberianscould notaﬀord primarycare and the deadlyvirusspread quickly. In partsof westAfri-ca with betterprimarycare, itwasmore easilycontained. Neglectofprimarycare isoften the unintended result ofgood intentions. International aid-givershave concentratedmuch oftheireﬀorton cuttingthe ratesofindividual infectiousdiseases, partlybecause successattreatingthem iseasier tomeasure. Governmentsin manydevelopingcountries, mean-while, have ploughed scarce moneyinto visible—and expen-sive—hospitalsin bigcities. Between 2002 and 2013 the num-beroflargerhospitalsin China nearlydoubled, whereas thetallyofprimary-care providersshrankby6%. China nowhasmore hospital bedsperperson than America. Such lopsidednessiswasteful. Primarycare can deal withthe vastmajorityofmedical consultations. Expandingprim-arycare tendsto bringmarked improvements.

Theyshould recognise the pre-emi-nence ofboardsofdirectorsthatrepresentall shareholders.And theyshould demand higherreturnsfrom promoter-dominated ﬁrms, in recognition ofthe higherrisks.

AftertheArab springof2011the Brotherhood wonEgypt’sﬁrstfree elections; byearly 2012 itruled the country. Butthe army, led by Abd-el-Fattah al-Sisi and backed bymassprot-ests, soon booted itfrom power. Fouryearsago thismonth MrSisi, nowthe president,crushed the movementin Rabaa al-Ada-wiya square (pictured). Todaythose notdead orin jail have ﬂed orhidden. Yetthe Brotherhood, a transnationalmovementthathasspawned manyotherIslamistpartiesin the region, still inspiresfearin Arab autocrats. Forproof, look nofurtherthan the standoﬀoverQatar. Egypt,Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emiratesand Bahrain have cutoﬀdiplomaticandtransportlinkswith the tinygas-richsheikhdom, demandingthatitend itssup-portforthe Brotherhood; shutdown Al Ja-zeera, a Brotherhood-friendlybroadcaster;and kickouttroopsfrom Turkey, which isled bya Brotherhood-inspired party, Jus-tice and Development(AK). Theyinsistthatthe Brotherhood isa terroristorganisa-tion which threatensto up-end the estab-lished order.Thatthe Brotherhood hasinspired vio-lence and thatitsmembershave carriedoutattacksisnotin doubt; whetherit ises-sentiallyviolentisharderto say. Hassan al-Banna, who founded the movementin Is-mailia, in north-eastEgypt, in 1928, calledforgradual reform, buthe accommodatedmilitantmembers. Sayyid Qutb, a leadingﬁgure in the Brotherhood in the 1950sand1960s, favoured takingup armsagainst im-piousrulers. Modern Islamism—broadlydeﬁned asthe pursuitofa state governedbyIslamicprinciples—grewoutofthis de-bate in variousdirections. Itscurrent incar-nationsand hybridisationsinclude groupsasdiverse asEnnahda, a peaceful Tunisianpolitical party, and IslamicState (IS), a viol-entjihadistgroup thatcallsthe Brothersapostates. Today’sEgyptian Brotherhoodissplitbetween those who embrace con-frontational tactics, includingsome whocountenance violence, and those who fa-voura more conciliatoryapproach.The Saudisand the othercountriesleaningon Qatarclaim thatthe whole Is-lamistspectrum isbeyond the pale.(Though some have made tactical com-mon cause with Islamistsin Palestine, Ye-men and Syria.) Others—includingWest-ern governmentsthathave resisted calls tobrand the Brotherhood a terroristorganisa-tion—thinkthere are distinctionsworthmaking. Thisisnoteasilydone. Whenelected, ostensiblymoderate and demo-craticIslamistshave too often proved to beneither, lendingcredence to the argumentthattheircommitmentto democracygoeslittle furtherthan “one man, one vote, onetime.” Butsome Islamistsare participatingin politics, and even leadinggovernments,moderatelyand eﬀectively.Islamistsare hardlyalone in attemptingto injectreligion into publiclife. In Indiathe rulingBJPespousesa speciﬁcallyHin-dunationalism. Israel hasa range of par-tiesseekingto create a more overtly Jewishstate. Europe hasmanyChristian Demo-cratswho take both partsofthe name seri-ously. In America the Republican Party’splatform holdsthatif“God-given, natural,inalienable rights” conﬂictwith “govern-ment, court, orhuman-granted rights”, theformermustalwaysprevail. “Theyare say-ingsomethingon which all Islamistscouldagree,” saysNathan Brown ofGeorgeWashington University.In the beginningIslam isunique, though, in atleastone re-gard. WhereasMoseswasa leaderwithoutastate and Jesuswasa dissidentexecutedbyone, the ProphetMuhammad wasa po-litical leaderwho founded a polity, andMuslim scripture reﬂectsthat. “In the Ko-ran, there are clear, directtextual injunc-tionsrangingfrom the implementation ofthe hududpunishments[foroﬀencessuchastheft] to speciﬁcruleson inheritance,”writesShadi Hamid ofthe BrookingsInsti-tution, a think-tank, in “IslamicException-alism”.

In one suraMuham-mad isinstructed to consultmembersofthe community; in anotherhe isgiven ab-solute poweroverthem. Disagreementsstarted immediatelyupon the prophet’sdeath. Hisclosestfollowerscould not de-cide ifthe role ofcaliph—the presumedsuccessorto Muhammad asleader—should be elective orhereditary, a disputethateventuallyled to the schism between,respectively, Sunnisand Shias.The caliphate itselfisnotmandated bythe Koran. But“traditional Muslim thoughtregarded [it] asan inherentpartofIslam,unintentionallypoliticisingthe faith forcenturies,” writesMustafa Akyol, the au-thorof“Islam withoutExtremes”. Heredi-tarycaliphatesin which religiousand sec-ularpowerwere united in one ﬁgure werethe model forIslamicpolitiesformorethan a millennium. Itwasthe break-up ofthe Ottoman em-pire and the abolition ofthe caliphate byrepublican Turkeythatultimatelyled tothe modern-dayIslamistmovement. Mus-limshumiliated bycolonialism and thefailuresofsocialism and nationalism, un-derwhich home-grown autocratstried toco-optIslam fortheirown beneﬁt, longedforan alternative thatmade sense in aworld ofnation-statesand elections. TheBrotherhood presented them with one.Democracywasnotone ofMuham-mad’sprescriptions, so Banna rejected itasaforeign import, alongwith political par-tiesand even the modern Arab state. Buthe also sawprogresstowardsthe Islamicstate happeningin stages, each requiringdiﬀerenttactics. So Islamistsmight playdown theirdivine objective earlyon, andeven participate in elections, ifitimprovedtheirposition in the longterm. Some ofhisfollowerscame to acceptdemocracyaspartofall stagesofthe process; but criticsheld thatmostIslamistswere atheart anti-democraticand continue so to be.Thatisone lensthrough which to viewAKand itsimposingleader, Recep TayyipErdogan. When MrErdogan founded AKin2001he appeared to representa newkindofIslamism, whatsome called “Islamism-lite”, thatfocused on freedom and freemarkets. Afterwinninglegislative elec-tionsforthe ﬁrsttime in 2002, the partypushed through democraticreforms, sub-dued Turkey’sarmyand strengthened thestate’srecognition ofhuman rights. Itwasheld up asa hopeful template forother Is-lamistparties.Gradually, though, MrErdogan concen-trated powerin hishands. He co-opted thestate-run media and ousted criticsin thegovernment, armyand judiciary. More lib-eral membersofAK, such asAbdullah Gul,aformerpresident, were pushed aside. Anunsuccessful coup in July2016 led to an all-outpurge. Tensofthousandsofenemies,real and imagined, were arrested, includ-ingjournalists. Civil-societygroups wereshutdown, civil servantssacked, access topartsofthe internetblocked.

Bythe end ofhisﬁrstyearhe had de-creed thathe wasnotbound byjudicial re-straints. He pushed through a constitutionthatwasopposed bysecularpoliticiansand ﬂooded the governmentwith Islam-ists. Bythe time ofthe coup againsthimmuch ofthe publicwason the army’sside. Some nowargue thatthese outcomes—illiberal successin Turkey, illiberal failure inEgypt—were foreseeable, even inevitable.Butitisworth lookingatthe contexts. Be-fore AKcame on the scene in Turkey, fourpreviousIslamistpartieshad been closedasa resulteitherofa coup ora court order.AfterAKcame to poweritcontinued to bethreatened. Secularistsin the army—partofthe country’s“deep state”—tried to blockthe party’spresidential candidate in 2007.Ayearlater, Turkey’schiefprosecutorac-cused AKofbeinganti-secularand cameclose tohavingitbanned. There wasa hostofotherpoliticallymotivated attacks—andthen there wasthe coup attempt. In Egyptthe Brotherhood faced similaropposition from a deep state ofsoldiers,judgesand bureaucrats. The police refusedto patrol the streets, leadingto a spike incrime. Employeesofthe gasand powercompaniescreated artiﬁcial blackouts andfuel shortages. Judgesappointed byMrMorsi’spredecessordeclared the results ofan election invalid. Minorities retortThese challengesdo notexcuse the au-thoritarianism displayed byMrMorsi andMrErdogan. Butperhapstheyexplain itbetterthan notionsofan illiberal essencein theirideology. “Islamistpartiestend toadaptto theirpolitical environment,” saysMarcLynch ofGeorge Washington Univer-sity. The fearthatsecularistswould try toundermine theirgovernmentsconvincedelected Islamiststhattheyneeded to grabasmuch poweraspossible; the lackofdeep-seated democratictraditionsmadethingsworse. The problem with AK, saysMrAkyol, isnotthatithasbeen too Islam-ist: “Itisjustprovingto be too Turkish.”Elsewhere, Islamistpartieshave contin-ued to take partin elections. The Brother-hood’schaptersin Jordan and Kuwait, aftersuﬀeringyearsofrepression, did relativelywell in parliamentaryelectionslastyear. ABrotherhood spin-oﬀ, the PartyofJusticeand Democracy(PJD), haswon Morocco’stwo mostrecentparliamentaryelectionsand leadsthe currentgovernment. Outsidethe Brotherhood’sorbit, Islamistpartiesare politicallyactive in Indonesia, Malay-sia and Pakistan. The idea thatall such par-tiesare playingBanna’slonggame cannotbe disproved.Butitisatleastplausible that,in environmentsthatdo notencourage au-thoritarianism, itisnota necessary devel-opment. In nearlyall the placeswhere Is-lamistsare politicallyactive, there arecheckson howmuch powertheycanamass. Monarchsare the real authority inMorocco, Jordan and Kuwait.Thatsaid, Islamistsdo nothave to winnational electionsto have an illiberal im-pact.

When Ahoktried to argueagainstthisclaim, citingthe Koran, a doc-tored video made itseem asifhe was dis-paragingthe holybook. He waschargedwith blasphemy, lostthe election and hasnowbeen sentenced to jail. Indonesia thusshowshowthe work-ingsofdemocracycan magnifythe powerofan illiberal minority. Asurveyconduct-ed in 2015 bythe Centre forthe Studyof Is-lam and Society, a think-tankin Jakarta,found thatthe proliferation ofsharia-based ordinanceswaslargelythe result oflocal politiciansaccedingto the demandsofconservative Muslim groupsin ex-change forvotes.

Infactthe partyhasoften seemed more inter-ested in usingIslam in the service of poli-tics, ratherthan the otherwayaround. Itisunsettlingforliberalsto know that,even in the minority, Islamistscan ratchetup restrictions. Butthatis, in the end, thesortofriskdemocraciesofall stamps livewith—and which, ifthe democraciesarestrong, can be fought. Hence the belief ofsome analyststhatelections, notliberal-ism, mattermost: illiberal democracy, theysay, isa precursorto liberal democracy. Inpreviouslyauthoritarian countriesdemoc-racymustbe given time to take rootand bestrengthened through practice. The secu-lariststryingto force the Brotherhood frompowerin Egyptin 2013 heard such argu-mentsoften.

Buton the whole, themovementfounded and still led byRachidGhannouchi hasdisplayed moderationand a rare willingnessto compromise.

Itdid not helpthatultraconservative Muslimsassassinat-ed two left-wingpoliticiansin 2013.Opposition to Ennahda rule culminat-ed in streetproteststhatthreatened toundo the country’sfragile democraticgains. Butinstead ofdiggingin, astheBrotherhood did in Egypt, Ennahda choseto yield ground (especiallyafterthe coupin Egypt).

In essence whattheyare hopingforisthatIslamists, long amovementofprotest, become lessIslamistwhen confronted with the realityofpow-er. Thatraisesotherquestions. “IfIslamistparties, once elected, have to give up theirIslamism...then thisrunscounterto the es-sence ofdemocracy—the notion thatgov-ernmentsshould be responsive to, oratleastaccommodate, publicpreferences,”writesMrHamid.More conservative membersofEnn-ahda are unhappywith the direction thatthe movementhastaken. OthersdoubtEnnahda’sbona ﬁdes, claimingthatfear ofrepression and revoltisthe motivatingfac-torbehind itsmoderation—in otherwords,thatitsactionsare tactical. “We getitfromall sides,” saysMrGhannouchi. Aswith Islamism’sdownfall in Egypt,itshappierprogressin Tunisia is, in largepart, a matterofcontext. Unlike Egypt andTurkey, Tunisia doesnothave a strong andpoliticised army.

In a televisedaddressto the nation on August21st, Amer-ica’spresidentadmitted thathe hadchanged hismind aboutthe warin Af-ghanistan. He said hisinstinct, after 16yearsofnotwinning, had been to pull out.Butaftera thorough policyreview, he haddecided to keep going.Thatreview, undertaken bythe defencesecretary, JamesMattis, and the nationalsecurityadviser, H.R. McMaster, wascom-pleted byJune. ButMrTrump, resistant toitsconclusionsand egged on bySteve Ban-non, a criticofmilitaryinterventionabroad who wasthen hischiefpoliticalstrategist, tried hard to ﬁnd an alternative.One scheme, promoted byMrBannonand devised byErikPrince, the founder ofBlackwater, a controversial securityﬁrm,involved replacingAmerican troopswithmercenaries. Buton August18th MrTrumpﬁnallyacquiesced to the plan setout byhisnational securityteam to send 3,500-5,000additional troopsto Afghanistan. The pros-pectofAfghanistan again becominga ha-ven forthe world’smostdangerousterro-ristsovercame hisaversion to ﬁghting aseeminglyunwinnable war. Itmaynothave been a coincidence thatMrBannonwasremoved from hisjob in the WhiteHouse on the same day.Atﬁrstsight, the Afghan strategy an-nounced byMrTrump appearsverysimi-larto thatofhispredecessor, BarackObama. Butithassome important—andwelcome—diﬀerences, which MrTrumpwaskeen to emphasise, while leavingit toMrMattisto decide the exactnumberoftroopsto send. General McMasterand for-merGeneral MattisknowAfghanistanwell. Theyand otherAmerican command-erswere quietlyappalled byMrObama’sapproach to Afghanistan, in which troopnumberswere cutto serve a domesticpo-litical timetable withoutregard to condi-tionson the ground.Since the beginningof2015, whenNATOended itscombatmission and hand-ed full responsibilityforAfghanistan’sse-curityto itsill-prepared forces, the Talibaninsurgencyhasstrengthened. According toareportearlierthisyearbySIGAR(the Spe-cial InspectorGeneral forAfghanistan Re-construction, a postcreated byCongress),the proportion ofthe countryunderun-contested governmentcontrol had fallenfrom 72% to 57% duringthe 12 monthstoNovember2016. In the same period, 6,785Afghan soldiersand policemen werekilled and 11,777 wounded, outofa total of370,000 personnel in both forces. Between2015 and 2016, 19 Americanswere killed inaction. MrObama had hoped to pull outeven the remaining8,400 American mili-tarytrainersand advisersbefore he left of-ﬁce. Buteventuallyhe decided to leave thedecision to hissuccessor.Notonlywill thatnumberrise by abouthalf, butrestrictionson whattheycan dowill be lifted. MrObama had conﬁned ad-visersto basesfarfrom the action. Nowtheywill be embedded with front-linecombatunitswhere theirpresence canhelp inexperienced oﬃcersbecome com-petentleadersand develop the skills need-ed to win—amongthem the abilityto callin airsupportand directitaccurately.Thatwill be useful, asAmerican com-manderswill nowhave much more free-dom to deployairpowerthan theyhad un-derMrObama. MrTrump declared:“Micromanagementfrom Washington,DC, doesnotwin battles. Theyare won inthe ﬁeld drawingupon the judgmentandexpertise ofwartime commandersandfront-line soldiersactingin real time, withreal authorityand with a clearmission todefeatthe enemy.”Athird improvementcompared withMrObama’spolicyisthatMrTrump hasheeded the advice ofMrMattisnotto setlimitson the duration ofAmerica’smis-sion in Afghanistan. Thatmatters. As longasthe Taliban knewthatall theyhad to dowaswaitforAmerican and NATOsoldiersto packtheirbags, theyhad no incentiveeven to considerpolitical negotiationswith Afghanistan’sgovernment. With anopen-ended commitmentbyAmerica, theTaliban’scalculationscould change.Itwill still remain diﬃcultfor Americato reach a pointwhere itcan claim successin Afghanistan. MrTrump’sinsistence thathe isnotin the businessofnation-buildingisall verywell. Butwithoutprogress bythedysfunctional Afghan governmentto-wardsdeliveringsecurityand basicser-vices, the Taliban will retain support in thePushtun south and eastofthe country.Noristhere much prospectofenlistingthe help ofAfghanistan’sneighbours. MrTrump isrightto take a tough line on Paki-stan’sprovision ofsanctuaryto the Tali-ban. Butcuttingbackmilitaryaid to Paki-stan in the pasthashad little eﬀect on itsbehaviour. Forall China’sinterestin ex-ploitingAfghanistan’smineral wealth, it isreluctantto getinvolved. Arecentdevelop-mentisespeciallyworrying: Iran and Rus-sia, alwayson the lookoutforopportuni-tiesto undermine Western interests, areaccused offunding, armingand shelteringthe Taliban. MrTrump maynotcare for“strategicpatience”, butwhen itcomestoAfghanistan he will need plentyofit. 7America’s Afghanistan strategySixteen years and countingAgainsthis instincts, Donald Trump has bowed to the advice ofhis generalsSomeday this war’s going to endThe EconomistAugust26th2017 Asia231Graveyards in PakistanHold yourhearsesDOWNa dustyside road in the prov-ince ofPunjab standsShehr-e-Kha-moshan, a newgraveyard with freezersimported from Germanyand a networkof22 video camerasthatwill allowrela-tivesofthe deceased to live-stream foot-age offuneralsatthe $1.5m facility.

Most Muslim-majority countries long ago abandonedthe practice for being sexist or questionable under religious law. But politicians inHindu-majority India had kept it going to win conservative Muslim votes. Hindunationalists hailed the ruling as a blow to the “appeasement” of minorities. Muslimliberals and women’s groups that have long opposed the practice also welcomed thedecision. Yet the ruling was narrow: three judges to two. Constitutional experts said theirlegal reasoning fell short of upholding personal rights over religious laws. The judgmentdid not ban other forms of Muslim divorce that favour men, only the instantkind.

And sometimessuch fruitcomesin bunches: two othershowsaboutcorruption are due to be broadcastthisautumn.Goingbypastform, viewerswill lap up the programmes. In-stead ofthe dietthatusuallydominatesChina’sairwaves—impe-rial costume dramasand patrioticpabulum aboutthe secondworld war—these showsoﬀera peekatcontemporarypolitics: ra-paciousoﬃcials, factional schemingand abusesofpower. Ontelevision, “In the Name ofthe People” setratingsrecords. Online,ithascontinued to do so. Asoflate Augusteach episode had beenwatched, on average, 174m times.Unquestionably, these showsare meantaspropaganda. In2015 the party’santi-graftagencynoted a gap in President Xi Jin-ping’seﬀortsto clean up the governmentand army(and crush hisrivals). Howcould the publicappreciate thisheroicstruggle with-outworksofart, especiallytelevisual ones, depicting it? Oﬃcialswanted whattheycalled “anti-corruption shows” in whichclean, upstandingoﬃcialsalwaysprevail overbad ones.Yetcreatinggood propaganda isfraughtwith danger. Chineseviewersare cannyand have plentyofotheroptionsforentertain-ment, legal and illegal, ifgovernment-sanctioned televisionboresthem. So the onlywayto gettheirattention, and to makethe whole enterprise believable, isto throwin plentyof realisticgrit. Thatcan muddle the message. Audiencesare drawn to thebad stuﬀ. Online, manyjustskip the bitsthatare meant to be mor-allyedifying. Some viewersconclude thatthe Communist Partyisirredeemablycorrupt, notthatitisbravelyﬁghting graft. Anti-corruption propaganda hasgone through variouscycles.Itwasnotuntil the 1990sthatCommunistoﬃcialsallowed thepublication ofnovelsfocusingon the venalityofoﬃcials. Thereason theydid so wasplain: corruption wasbecomingso ram-pantthatitcould notbe ignored. The partyhoped such workswould showthatgood forcesin the partywere determined tocurb corruption. Television producersstarted turningthesebooksinto shows, which became immenselypopular. Thespread ofegregiouscorruption waspartlythe productof a sea-change in China. The drive to build a capitalisteconomy gave oﬃ-cialsunprecedented opportunitiesto line theirpockets. Marketeconomicsaﬀected propaganda, too, astelevision stations want-ed commercial success. In the early2000s, to boostratings, theylettheirdramasaboutcorruption become edgier. Thinkingthatthese were doingmore harm than good, thepartyimposed a prime-time ban on them in 2004. Thiswasadeath knell forthe genre: producersknewtheywould not be ableto recoup theirinvestments. Television shows, mostlyhistoricaldramas, continued to touch on corruption-related topics fromtime to time. Butfora decade no showssetin present-day Chinawere dedicated to the theme.Since comingto powerin 2012, however, MrXi’sonslaughthasresulted in the jailingofseveral ofthe mostsenior ﬁgureseverto be convicted ofgraftunderCommunistrule. Oﬃcial accountsoftheirwrongdoinghave been staggering: roomspiled high withbanknotes, luxuryvillasgalore and familymembers, aswell asmistresses, livingthe life ofRiley. So in 2015 the propagandistsde-cided to liftthe ban again. Theyhad a ﬁne line to walk. Theyhadto avoid the extremesofthe anti-corruption showsofthe early2000s. Butwith so much information alreadypublic, they couldhardlypretend thatjusta handful ofoﬃcialswere bent. The propagandistsare thuson an erraticpath. Theyare fastde-velopingslicktechniquesformakingtheirworksmore convinc-ing. “In the Name ofthe People” breaksnewground. The seriesportraysa chain ofcorruption reachingrightup to a ﬁctitious dep-utyleaderofthe country(onlycostume dramasare allowed toimplicate the emperor). Yetthe partyalreadyseemsto be regret-tingitssuccess. Itisblockingcommentsonline about“In theName ofthe People”, and makingsure itisnotpromoted on thefrontpagesofwebsitesthathostit. Tellingly, censors have de-layed release ofone ofthe otheranti-corruption shows. The artofthe impossibleSittingin hismodesthome in the eastern cityofNanjing, thescriptwriterofthe series, ZhouMeisen, explainshowhe man-aged to gethisstoryapproved: itwasentirelybased on realevents, reported in state media. “Corruptoﬃcialsdo thingsthatare farbeyond the imaginative powersofwriters,” he chuckles.Sometimeswritersalso manage to do thingsthatare beyond theimagination ofcensors. MrZhouisone such author—he ﬂashesangeratthe notion thathe mightbe a partystooge. Even thoughcensorscarefullyvetted hisscript, manyfansofhiswork sayhiscrooked protagonistsare farmore convincingthan the good ones. Can the artofanti-corruption propaganda everbe perfected?Acomparison istelling. Propaganda ofa more conventional kind,with nationalistthemes, hasstarted hittingthe mark. Take “WolfWarrior2”, a blockbusterin which a Chinese commando killsAmerican mercenariesin Africa. Ithasgenerated such patrioticfervourthataudienceshave broken into the national anthem.Overthe top, yes. Butthe ﬁlm isgrounded in whatmany Chinesepeople believe to be true: thattheircountryiscatching up withAmerica. The problem with propaganda aboutthe party’sclean-up ofcorruption isthat, ultimately, fewreallybelieve it. 7The artofpropagandaIn China’s waron graft, television is a double-edged swordBanyanThe EconomistAugust26th201729For daily analysis and debate on America, visitEconomist.com/unitedstatesEconomist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica1TWO daysafterhe ceased to be Presi-dentDonald Trump’schiefstrategist,Steve Bannon explained whyhe had wel-comed The Economistto hishouse on Capi-tol Hill fora chat. “You’re the enemy,” hesaid, addingdisdainfully: “Yousupportaradical idea, free trade.

YetBreitbartwill caution MrTrump to stickto the populistnationalistcourse MrBannon charted. “We will neverturn on him. Butwe are nevergoingto letisunderstandable. Because MrBannon’sinﬂuence on America hasbeen immense.Though notwell-known when he washired to run MrTrump’scampaign lastAu-gust, he had alreadyshaped the celebrity-tycoon’spolitics. Asan attention-seekingNewYorkerand hostof“The Apprentice”,areality-television show, MrTrump hadnational name recognition and some liber-al views, includingon gun control and im-migration. Particularlyforthe Republicanhe sometimesclaimed to be, he also had alarge followingamongnon-whites. Ac-cordingto a bestsellingbookon the Trump-Bannon partnership byJoshua Green, ajournalist, Breitbartand itsbosswere in-strumental in convincingMrTrump to re-launch himselfasa right-wingpopulistnationalist, contemptuousofthe political-lycorrectestablishment.AsMrTrump’scampaign chief(histhird in two months, the campaign havingbeen roiled byscandals) MrBannon urgedhim to redouble thateﬀort. “The Americanpeople understood hisfoiblesand under-stood hischaracterﬂawsand theydidn’tcare,” he says. “The countrywasthirstingforchange and [Barack] Obama didn’tgivethem enough. I said, we are goingfor anationalistmessage, we are goingto go bar-barian, and we will win.”NothingdelightsMrTrump like vindi-cation, so itwasnatural thathe would re-ward MrBannon with a plum job in his ad-ministration. Hismain taskwasto ensurethe presidentkepthiscampaign pledges,which MrBannon scrawled on white-boardsin hisWestWingoﬃce.

In the earlymonthsofMrTrump’spresidency, he hadequal footingwith the chiefofstaﬀ, ReincePriebus, who wasousted lastmonth, andlaunched some ofthe administration’smostaudaciousendeavours, includingone to denyvisasto manyforeign Mus-lims. Yethispopulistagenda (dominatedbya trifecta ofambitions, to reduce immi-gration, recreate jobsin manufacturing, es-peciallythrough trade policy, and with-drawAmerican troopsfrom foreign wars)hassince faltered. MrTrump, ashisannouncementon Af-ghanistan illustrates, hasturned to otheradvisers. Theyinclude hisbusinessmanson-in-law, Jared Kushner, and hisnation-al-securityadviser, H.R. McMaster, withwhom MrBannon battled. AsMrBannonreturnsto America’s244th-most-popularwebsite, these mainstream ﬁguresare inthe ascendant.

The Ju-deo-Christian liberal Westwon.”MrTrump sharesMrBannon’sdisdainfortrade deals, hiszero-sum viewof theworld and hiscontemptforrivals. He hasfewﬁxed positionsotherwise.

Ontrade and securityin particular, they haveedged him towardsthe mainstream.WhereasMrBannon urged the presidentto withdrawfrom NAFTA and Afghani-stan, forexample, he haslaunched a mod-est-lookingreviewofthe formerand willsend more troopsto the latter.

Another, sometimes, isthepresident. Despite some signsofmodera-tion, MrTrump still hatestrade agree-ments, ashe reminded hisfollowersin aspeech in Phoenix, Arizona, on August22nd. He said he would “probably” with-drawfrom NAFTA“atsome point”.MrBannon’sinﬂuence will also endurein MrTrump’sconviction, which he en-couraged, thatthe presidentisanswerableonlyto hissupporters.

Recentlosses havebeen especiallysevere because ofan in-crease in bigstormsragingin from the GulfofMexico—such asHurricane Katrina, in2005, which led to the inundation ofNewOrleansand 1,836 deaths.

The vastnessoftheplain—Louisiana’scoastline alone is400mileslong—reﬂectsthe Mississippi’shugereach and sedimentload; the river, whichdrains41% ofthe contiguousUnited States,isestimated to transportaround 400mtonnesofsedimenta year. Italso reﬂectshowdynamicthe Mississippi is. Asit me-andered through itsdelta, the river, formostofthose millennia, constantlychanged itscourse through siltation anderosion. Every1,000 yearsorso, itaban-doned itsmain channel forone ofits dis-tributaries. Atime seriesofthe Mississip-pi’scourse lookslike a sinuousCeltic knot,with a swathe ofinterwoven curves, ﬂow-ingto the sea. Widespread ﬂoodingisnotcompatiblewith modern living, however. The ﬁrst le-veesofthe Mississippi were thrown uparound NewOrleansin the 18th century.Afterﬂoodingin 1927 displaced over600,000 people, Congressordered almosteveryuntamed reach ofthe riverto bestraitjacketed byearthworks.

Butithasstarved the deltaregion ofthe sedimentdepositsto which itowesitsexistence.Thisalone would be suﬃcientto causemassive erosion. Buttwo otherman-madefactorshave meanwhile boosted the corro-sive powerofthe sea—the yin to the Missis-sippi’syang. Since natural gaswasﬁrstobservedbubblingfrom a rice paddyin coastal Loui-siana in 1901, thousandsofoil wellshavebeen sunkinto the wetlands. To reachthem, almostasmanycanalshave beendredged from the Gulfbyenergycompa-nies. These channelshave injected seamsofsaline waterdeep into the marshes, kill-ingplantswhich tolerate onlyfresh orbrackish water, such asthe marsh andwoodland speciesthatonce surroundedIsle de Jean Charles. Thishasin turn re-duced the amountoforganicmatterthemarshesproduce, which actsasa counter-weightto anotherreductive process, theconstantsettlingand compactingofthe or-ganicplatform thatraisesthe marshlandabove the watertable.AtPointe-Aux-Chenes, anotherNativeAmerican village a couple ofmilesinlandfrom the Isle, thistransformation is vividlyapparent. The small bayou, orwaterway,runningbeside the village hasturned saltyand almostlapsatthe road alongside it.The live oaksthatgave the village its name(“chêne” means“oak” in French) are givingwayto marsh reedsand otherestuarinespecies. Asyourcorrespondentsurveyedthe waterway, a pairofbottlenose dol-phins—apexpredatorsin estuarine condi-tions—arched gracefullyfrom the water. Starved ofsilt, and with lessnew organ-icmatterto counteractitssettling, coastalLouisiana issinkingbackinto itsformerwaterystate. Meanwhile, because ofmelt-ingpolarice capsand thermal expansion,the sea level isrising. In the pastdecade theobserved relative sea-level rise in coastalLouisiana—a ﬁgure thatcombinesthe ef-fectsofrisingseasand subsidingland—wasovera centimetre a year, oraround fourtimesthe global average. The delta’ssys-tem ofland creation hasthusbeen throwninto reverse. In 1930, despite much engi-neeringofthe Mississippi’schannel, Loui-siana wasexpandingbyalmosta squaremile a year. Since then, an area the size ofDelaware hasbeen lostto the Gulf.Much ofthe CPRA’sworkinvolvesdredgingup sedimentwhere itisabun-dant, includingunderthe sea, and piping itto areasofthreatened marshland. Behindan artiﬁcial beach in Cameron Parish, BrettDupuis, a projectmanagerforWeeksMa-rine, a dredgingcompany, isworkingon a$31m projectto restore 740 acres(300 hect-ares) ofsubmerged marsh, which wasin-undated bythe sea duringHurricane Ritain 2005. Forthree monthshisdredgingplatform, two milesoﬀshore, hasbeensuckingup dirtfrom the sea bed and pipingitashore. The result, where open waterused to be, isa bed ofgreyooze up to tenfeetdeep, with a slurpyfountain ofgunkwhere the dredgingpipe emptiesinto it.“Good thickstuﬀ,” nodsMrDupuisap-provingly, aslaughinggullsand brown pel-icanswheel and chatteroverhead.

ThousandsofsquaremilesofLouisiana are in the process ofdis-appearing; theycannotbe replaced by die-sel-powered enginesan acre ata time. Or,asMel Landryofthe National Oceanic andAtmosphericAdministration putsit, whileinspectingMrDupuis’sprogress: “We’vegotmore workto do than we could everpayfor.” Even assumingthe CPRAgetsthe $50bnitisanglingfor, itpredictsanother 1,450square milesofLouisiana will be lost overthe next50 years.

The mostadvanced such scheme,known asthe Mid-Barataria SedimentDiv-ersion, would create a channel from theMississippi, south ofNewOrleans, capa-ble offunnelling75,000 cubicfeet(2.1m li-tres) ofsiltywaterpersecond into badlyeroded PlaqueminesParish. In full ﬂow,the channel would carrywaterequivalentto the seventh-largestriverin America. Thescheme would cost$1bn and iscurrentlybeingappraised bythe USArmyCorpsofEngineers, which overseesthe manage-mentofthe Mississippi’slevees.To preserve southern Louisiana insomethingclose to itscurrentshape, manysuch diversionsmightbe required. Expertsenthusiasticallysaytheycould reconnectthe riverto the delta; othersdoubttheywould workasintended because, asa re-sultofdamsand dredgingupstream, abouthalfthe Mississippi’ssedimentno longerreachesitslowercourse. The boosters areprobablyright: a bigdistributaryof theMississippi, the Atchafalaya, which si-phonsoﬀabouta third ofthe river’swaterand more ofitssedimentload in centralLouisiana, hashad itsbasin leveed, but notitsbanks, and itismakingland. Yet resis-tance to the mooted diversionsisﬁerce.Such schemeswere ﬁrstdiscussed inthe 1990s, when the scale ofthe land lossbegan to be recognised bypolicymakers.Theyhave since been blocked bya coupleofwell-organised groups, led bythe state’spowerful oysterfarmers, who have creptfurtherinland with the estuarine condi-tionsin which oystersthrive, and do notwantto see theirstockswiped outby agush ofmuddywater. The CorpsofEngineers, a slow-movingbureaucracythatdistrustsgreen infrastruc-ture and isreluctantto build ﬂoodgates initslevees, presentsa diﬀerentchallenge. Itsaysitwill take ﬁve yearsmerelyto reviewthe feasibilityofthe Mid-Barataria scheme.Atthe currentrate ofloss—abouta football-ﬁeld ofland everyhour—Louisiana willchange a lotwhile the agencydeliberates.“The Corpsisincapable ofrespondingwith the necessaryurgencyto the coastalerosion crisisin Louisiana,” saysCongress-man Graves. “The main reason forthe ero-sion islevee-building. Itamazesme thatthe Corpshasno sense ofguiltabout theirresponsibility. Theyhave an obligation toﬁxwhattheybroke.” The damagingeﬀectofthe levees waspredicted. Weighingthe beneﬁtsofengi-neeringthe Mississippi in 1897, a formerpresidentofthe American SocietyofCivilEngineers, E.L. Corthell, noted the need totake into account“withholdingbythe le-vees…ofthe annual contributionsofsedi-mentarymatters” and, because ofthis,“subsidence ofthe Gulfdelta landsbelowthe level ofthe sea and theirgradual aban-donment.” Butwhile he warned that“thepresentgeneration should notbe selﬁsh,”MrCorthell assumed the economicbene-ﬁtsofprotectingthe ﬂood zone would “beso remarkable thatpeople ofthe wholeUnited Statescan well aﬀord, when thetime comes, to build a protective leveeagainstthe Gulfwaters.”Thatillustratestwo related weaknessesin much environmental policymaking: anassumption thatfuture politicianswilltake a longer-term viewthan currentones,and an excessive willingnessto discountthe future costsofsolvingenvironmentalproblemscaused today. PresidentDonaldTrump, though eagerto splurge $20bn onan unnecessaryborderwall, appearsnotto have given thoughtto the seawall MrCorthell envisaged. In anyevent, itisdoubtful such a scheme would be aﬀord-able orotherwise practical, consideringthe eﬀectsofrisingsea levelsand ﬁercerstorms, both consequencesofglobalwarming, which the Republican presidenteitherdoesnotbelieve in orcare about.In a ditherSome ofthe hoped-fordiversions, atleast,will probablybe built. The political con-sensusin Louisiana forsuch action is ap-parentateverylevel ofgovernment.“We’re all pullingtogetheron this,” saysRyan Bourriaque, the administratorofCameron Parish. “It’sa greatexample ofhowindustry, conservationistsand diﬀer-entgovernmentagenciescan all marry.”MrGraves, who recentlybecame chair-man ofa House subcommittee thatover-seesthe CorpsofEngineers, will also chiv-vyitrelentlessly. Yetanyone looking toLouisiana forhope thatAmerica will de-velop a more rational climate policyis lia-ble to be frustrated. The state’simpressivecoastal policyillustratesAmerica’sabilityto adaptto a natural disasterthatis alreadyupon it. Itdoesnotseem to have nudgedthe state, orthe Republican Party, any clos-erto policiesthatmightslowthe warmingthatiscontributingto thatdisaster.Louisiana’sformergovernor, BobbyJin-dal, wasa strongsupporterofthe CPRA.While preparingto run forthe Republicanpresidential ticketin 2016, he nonethelessdescribed climate change asa “TrojanHorse” fora left-wingpowergrab: “It’sanexcuse forsome who neverliked free-mar-keteconomiesand neverliked rapid eco-nomicgrowth.” MrGraves, remarkably,given howaverse he seemsto talkingnon-sense on scientiﬁcmatters, sayshe sharesthatview. He also, despite hisreliance onthe IPCC’ssea-rise projections, sayshedoesnotacceptthe scientiﬁcbody’scon-sensusthatmostofthe observed recentwarmingiscaused byhuman activities.To plan hugelyexpensive governmentaction on the basisofthe latestclimate pro-jections, butatthe same time to claim thescience underpinningthem istoo weak tojustifycurbinggreenhouse-gasemissions,asmostclimate scientistsrecommend, isatbestinconsistent. PerhapsittrulyreﬂectsMrGraves’sthinking. Italso seemspossi-ble thathe wantsto keep onside the energycompanieswhich provide around 40,000jobsin Louisiana and donate generously tohispolitical campaigns. Those ﬁrmsare re-sponsible, directlyand indirectly—throughtheircanal-dredgingand because ofthegreenhouse-gasemissionstheyfacilitate—fora lotofLouisiana’scoastal erosion. YetMrGraves, moral scourge ofthe bureau-craticCorps, isalso opposed to several on-goinglegal campaignsto make the compa-niespaycompensation forthe damagetheyhave caused. Itishard to make sense ofthis, exceptperhapsbyrecourse to MrCorthell. Thepresentgeneration should notbe selﬁsh.Butitalwaysis.7The way things were34UnitedStatesThe EconomistAugust26th2017MCLENNANCountyin Texaswitnessed two unusual eventson August21st. The ﬁrstwasa solareclipse, the second aDemocratrunningforthe Senate—though the county, in sun-baked central Texas, wentforDonald Trump by27 pointsoverHillaryClinton. Texasmaybe increasinglydiverse (itis 40% His-panic) buthasnotelected a Democraticsenatorin 30 years.The DemocratwasRepresentative Beto O’Rourke—a rangy,earnestformerpunk-rockmusician, software entrepreneur andcongressman forthe bordertown ofEl Paso. He delivered hismessage to a crowd atthe TexasRangerHall ofFame and Muse-um in Waco. LotsofDemocratssee an opportunityin MrTrump.With each daysuch partisansare sure thatthispresident will dis-gustmore decentAmericansand disappointthe bigotsandchumpswho still admire him. Angryresistance to such a brute,theyfeel, mustbringvictory. MrO’Rourke, a ﬂoppy-haired 44-year-old who remindsfansofRobertKennedy, seesa diﬀerent op-portunity. Hiscampaign amountsto a betthatwhen voters chosean outsider-strongman aspresident, theyshowed a desire to takerisksto end Washington gridlock—and are nottoo fussed aboutideological questionslike the size ofgovernment. Aconventional Democratrunningforthe Senate in Texaswould lambastthe Republican up forre-election in 2018: TedCruz, a divisive, God-and-guns, government-bashingconserva-tive and formerpresidential challenger. Instead, MrO’RourkebarelymentionsMrCruz. He merelycontrastshisown record ofholdingmonthlytown-hall meetingsin El Paso (meetingvotersinstilsa “healthyfear” when castingvotesin DC, he says) with MrCruz’srelative inaccessibility.Both loved and loathed, MrCruzenjoysnearuniversal namerecognition in Texasand hasaccessto colossal funding. MrO’Rourke, in histhird term representinga bordercityin a farcor-nerofthe state, hasforsworn moneyfrom political action com-mittees, secretive outﬁtswhich can acceptunlimited donations.Hishope liesin individual donationsfrom around the country.He often mentionsthe viral online successofa two-day road triphe made in March with a Republican congressman from Texas,Will Hurd, aftera snowstorm grounded ﬂightsto Washington.The genial pair(MrHurd isan ex-CIAagentunafraid to criticiseMrTrump) drewnational attention with theirlivestreamed jour-ney, astheymunched bad food and debated politics.An O’Rourke campaign stop featuresmanystoriesofRepub-lican- and Democratic-votingTexanshe hasmeton a long tourofthe state in a pickup truck(Waco wasDay24). He frequentlycon-cludesthat“the onlywayto getmeaningful thingsdone” istoworkacrosspartylines. Though he disagreeswith MrTrumpoversuch issuesasimmigration, the environmentand criminal-justice reform, when he seescommon ground—forinstance, theirshared scepticism aboutopen-ended foreign wars—he says so.He stressesapprenticeships, job-trainingand health policies thatboth partiescan support.El Paso ishome to a large armybase and 54,000 ex-service-men, and the Democrathasmade veterans’ aﬀairsa focusofhiswork. In Waco, and the nextdayin Killeen, neara giant armybaseatFortHood, MrO’Rourke described a bill he isco-sponsoringwith a Republican from Colorado, Mike Coﬀman, allowing trou-bled veteranswith a less-than-honourable discharge access tomental health servicesatveterans’ hospitals. MrCoﬀman point-ed outa mistake in the bill he had drafted, MrO’Rourke related.Because theirbill isbipartisan itpassed the House veterans’ af-fairscommittee unanimously, givingitbetteroddsofbecominglaw. “Let’shave a round ofapplause forbipartisanship,” he cried.In veterans’ aﬀairs, MrO’Rourke hasstumbled on an interest-ingspeciality. Americansreveal much abouttheirreal beliefswhenevertheydemand (asalmostall do) more generous, feder-allyfunded health care and beneﬁtsforex-servicemen, one ofthefewgroupsto baskin nearlyunanimouspublicapproval. Ifcon-servativestrulybelieved that“I’m from the government, and I’mhere to help” are the mostterrifyingwordsin the English lan-guage, to quote the old Reagan joke, theywould notwant to inﬂictthe crueltyoffederal help on the ex-soldierstheyrevere. In truth,lotsofRepublicanslike safety-netsforthe deserving(as MrTrump understands, when he sayshe will notcutSocial Securityand Medicare forthe old). WhatmanyAmericanshate isredistri-bution to folktheysee asfeckless.With hisanecdotesaboutsuicide prevention forveterans, oraboutRepublican-votingChristiansin rural caféswho worryaboutpublic-school funding, MrO’Rourke is—in eﬀect—explor-ingwaysforDemocratsto be the partythathelpsreasonable Re-publicansmake governmenteﬀective.Weaning a big state oﬀpettypartisanshipThisisnota beton centrism. MrO’Rourke isa pro-immigrantpro-gressive who supportslegal abortions, forinstance. Instead, hetalksofﬁndingcommon ground with abortion opponentsbyworkingon reducingunwanted pregnancies. Hisisa hunch thatthe dividesbetween political tribescan be bridged ifvoters’ aspi-rationsare beingmet. Thatwill be hard. The ﬁrstquestion hefaced in Waco wasaboutimpeachingMrTrump, drawingcheersfrom the overwhelminglyDemocraticcrowd. Acampaign stop atan American Legion postin Killeen drewJerryStewart, a retiredmeat-cutter, Vietnam veteran and Republican. MrStewart feltnokinship with bushy-bearded old soldiersthere who asked aboutlegalisingmedical marijuana (asMrO’Rourke advocates). “To meitturned into a drugdiscussion,” growled MrStewart. “I’m strong-lyagainstmarijuana, I sawin Vietnam howitmessed guys up.”MrO’Rourke islikelyto lose nextyear. Still, hisexperiment de-servesto be taken seriously. Hiscampaign aimsto make politicsmore like publicservice than war. Ifhe makesanyheadway, na-tional leadersshould take note.7Beto-testinga newpoliticsATexas Democrattries to ﬁnd the good in Trump-era disruptionLexingtonThe EconomistAugust26th2017351FEWissuesbedevil El Salvadormorethan howto deal with criminal gangs.One group called Mara Salvatrucha andtwo factionsofanother, Barrio 18, havecarved up much ofthe countryinto zonesoverwhich theyrule and from which theyextractproﬁt—mainlybyextortingmoneyfrom businessesand residents. Clashes be-tween them, and with the police, helpmake El Salvadorone ofthe world’smostviolentcountries. Atruce between the governmentandthe gangsin March 2012, endorsed bytheCatholicchurch and the Organisation ofAmerican States, reduced the killingdra-matically(see chart). Butitwasunpopular,especiallyamongprosperousSalvador-eans. Extortion continued. Citizenswererevolted byreportsofimprisoned gangmembersenjoyingfried-chicken feastsand the servicesofstrippers. Vowingthatthe governmentwould“notnegotiate with criminals”, SalvadorSánchezCerén, who tookoﬃce asthecountry’spresidentin June 2014, intro-duced a mano dura (iron-ﬁst) policyto-wardsthe gangs. He ended the armistice,putthe armyon the streetsand clampeddown on prisons. The death toll jumped. Now18 people who helped implementthe truce have been placed on trial in a spe-cial “organised-crime court”, which hearsnotjustcasesagainstcriminalsand mur-derersbutalso those likelyto cause “alarmorsocial commotion”. The evidence aboutcollusion between gangstersand politi-cians, includingthe mostardentadvocatesofmano dura, has, ifanything, onlyin-erygun the gangturned in (a surrender ofweaponsispictured above). Nalo alleged thatone defendant, RaúlMijango, a formerguerrilla commanderwho helped negotiate the truce, encour-aged the gangsto increase temporarily thepace ofkillingwhen the deal seemed to bebreakingdown and gangsterswere losingprivileges.MrMijango also haggled on be-halfofthe three gangs with the ownersofarice mill overan extortion payment, Naloclaimed. MrMijango vigorouslydeniesthathe endorsed anyincrease in killing,and sayshe convinced the gangs to givethe mill a discount. On his penultimate dayoftestimonyNalo opened ﬁre on politicians, who arenotin the dock. Duringthe presidentialcampaign in 2014 gangmembersmetpoli-ticiansfrom both the main parties—MrSánchez’sleft-wingFMLNand Arena, theright-wingopposition party. Some wereﬁerce criticsofthe truce. The politicians“asked forvotes”, oﬀeringcash in return,Nalo claimed. The FMLNpaid $250,000and Arena gave $100,000, which the gangsspenton M-16sand AK-47s. MrSánchezwon byjust6,634 votes.Nalo’sallegationsare unsubstantiated.MrFunes, who decamped to Nicaragualastyearafterhe learned he wasbeing in-vestigated forcorruption, tweeted that the“absurd accusation” is“based above all onwhata plea-bargain delinquentsays”. Nor-man Quijano, the defeated Arena candi-date, simplysaid he knewnothingofmeet-ingsbetween hispartyand gangsters. Butthere isotherevidence ofdodgy creased publiccommotion. The chargesagainstthe defendants,mostlyprison oﬃcialsand policemen, in-clude “illicitassociation” with gangstersand introducingforbidden itemssuch asmobile phonesinto prisons.The mostsensational momentsofthetrial came on August7th-11th, when“Nalo”, a brawnyshaven-headed gangster,tookthe stand. In 2012-14 he had acted asthe envoyofthe jailed leadersofBarrio 18’s“revolutionary” faction in talkswith thegovernmentofthen-PresidentMauricioFunes. Nalo described justhowgrubby thetruce was.

LastyearEl Faro, a Salvadoreannewswebsite, published a video ofa meet-ingin 2014 in which two seniorpoliticiansfrom Arena, which campaigned againstthe truce, promised gangmembersa newarmistice ifMrQuijano won the election.

ManySalvadoreans, accustomed to ac-countsofmalfeasance bytheirleaders, aremore despairingthan outraged. Whathope theyhave foraccountabilitycomesfrom DouglasMeléndez, the crusadingat-torney-general who pushed forthe trial.He isseen asEl Salvador’sonlyeﬀectiveupholderofthe rule oflaw. He hasthrilled the countrybypursuingcorruption casesagainstex-presidentsfrom both parties, includingMrFunes andAntonio Saca, who isin jail awaiting trial.MrMeléndezhasstrongbackingfrom theUnited States, which ispayingforpro-grammesto improve security. Butfewofhiscaseshave moved beyond evidence-gathering. To some critics, hisplea-bargaindealswith gangsterslike Nalo looklike thedubiousdealmakingthathe hasputontrial. Manywonderwhetherthe inquisi-tion will move beyond the underlingsincourtto the politiciansthatNalo ﬁngered.The hearingshave turned, in eﬀect, intoatrial ofthe truce itself. Anyfuture deal toend the violence will be harderto negoti-ate. Aproposal to provide moneyforgang-sterswho wanta wayout, which ispart ofthe US-backed securityplan, hasbeenstalled in the legislature forseven years.NGOshave stopped helpinggangmem-bers to getjobsforfearofbeingjailed forworkingwith “terrorists”.Fornow, co-operation between crimi-nalsand politicianshasgiven wayto all-outconﬂict. In 2016 Salvadorean securityforceskilled 591gangmembersin “confron-tations”; eightpolice oﬃcersand two sol-diersdied in those clashes.The govern-menthasblocked callsbetween jailedgangstersand confederateson the outside.Overall, the death toll hasfallen thanks tothese mano durameasures, the govern-mentboasts. Billboardsbragthatthe num-berofmurdershasdropped bymore thanhalf. Gangsters, too, have a self-serving ex-planation. Asthe bodiesofyoungmenkilled bypolice piled up, leadersof thethree gangsagreed in March lastyear thattheirmembersshould stop killingeachother. “We’re notfriends,” said a Barrio 18spokesman in a video, butgangsare unitedin trying“to stop the violence that’sas-saultingourcountry”. Salvadoreanshaveaslittle faith in thattruce asthey did in theone brokered bypoliticians. 7THE son ofEuropean refugees, Peru’spresident, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, isﬂu-entin Spanish, English, German andFrench. He doesnotspeakanyofthe coun-try’s47 indigenouslanguages. Yethisgov-ernmentisdoingmore to encourage theuse ofthose tonguesthan did those of hispredecessors, some ofwhom have indige-nousroots.In DecemberTVPerú, the state-run tele-vision network, began broadcastingtheﬁrstnational dailynewsprogramme inQuechua. In April thisyearitstarted one inAymara. On August10th the governmentlaunched its“policyfornative languages”,partofitspreparationsforthe 200th anni-versaryofindependence in 2021. Itwouldrequire governmentagenciesto oﬀerser-vicesin those languagesin areaswheretheyare dominant. Some 4m ofPeru’s31m people speakone ofthe country’snative languagesastheirmothertongue. Three-quartersofthose speakQuechua, the idiom oftheInca. Governments, both before and afterindependence, have marginalised the lan-guagesand discriminated againstpeoplewho speakthem. Manylive in the least ac-cessible partsofPeru, mountain and jungledistrictswhere povertyratesare often dou-ble the national average and Spanish isbarelyspoken. The constitution gives na-tive languagesoﬃcial status“where theypredominate”, butthe state haslargely ig-nored thatarticle. Onlyin the lastadminis-tration, led byOllanta Humala, who hasQuechua roots, did the governmentstart toenforce lawsmandatingbilingual schools. MrKuczynski, who hasbeen presidentsince July2016, wantsto go furtheraspartofhispush forsocial and economic“inclu-sion”. “The governmentisgettingdown tobusiness,” saysClodomiro Landeo, the co-hostofthe Quechua newscast, “Ñuqan-chik”, which means“all ofus”.He and hisfellowindigenous-languagenewsreadershope to help erase the stigmathatstill comeswith speakingnon-Euro-pean languages. Rita Choquecahua, whoco-hoststhe Aymara newscast, “Jiwasa-naka” (which meansthe same thingasÑu-qanchik), wasdiscouraged from speakingthe language asa girl “because itwouldkeep usback”. The ownerofa coﬀee shopwhere she wasﬁlminga promotional vid-eo asked herto leave: the customers foundhertraditional skirtand hatoﬀ-putting.Marisol Mena, MrLandeo’sco-host,sayspeople lookaskance ifshe speaksQuechua in a shoppingcentre ora bankqueue. “People treatyoulike youhave tobe poor.

Ofthe 70,000 people killed in theﬁghtbetween the insurgentsand the gov-ernment, three-quartersdid notspeakSpanish astheirﬁrstlanguage.

In2011a reportcommissioned bythe then-president, GoodluckJonathan, recom-mended cuttingthe numberoffederalagenciesfrom 263 to 161.

The restare atboardingschooloruniversity. “I don’twantanyofmychil-dren taken away,” saysMsBrown.Buttheymaybe. More than halfofRwanda’sorphanageshave closed since2012, when the governmentdecided theywere doingmore harm than good.

Adecade ago there weresome 400.Orphanageshave proliferated in Africain recentdecadesin response to war, dis-ease and natural disasters. In Uganda thenumberofchildren in them jumped from2,900 in 1992 to 50,000 in 2013. Buttheirnumberseemsto have peaked. In Ghananearly100 were closed between 2010 and2015. The Ethiopian governmenthasshutdozenssince 2011. Sudan and South Africahave asked HHC foradvice. Several Afri-can countrieshave also banned orsus-pended adoptionsbyparentsfrom abroad. Acase can be made againstsuch institu-tions, particularlythe biggerones. Morethan a third ofchildren in them suﬀerabuse, saysHHC. Theirproliferation hasbeen helped byfundingfrom well-mean-ingAmerican evangelicals. Yettheirexis-tence hasbecome self-perpetuatingastheyattract“orphanage tourists”, invitedin the hope thattheywill donate money. Thathascreated perverse incentives.Orphanagessometimessearch forchil-dren to ﬁll beds. Asurveyin Malawi foundthat52% were activelyrecruitingchildrenwho would nototherwise have been con-sidered orphans. MostAfrican orphanshave atleastone parent. In Rwanda a thirdare in regularcontactwith relatives, sug-gestingthatmanycould be cared forbytheirextended families. Indeed, before theorphanage boom, African children with-outlivingparentswere usuallycared forinthisway. Butthe promise ofa better lifemayencourage poorparentsto give chil-dren up.Yetthere isalso evidence thatthe argu-mentsagainstputtingchildren into biggerinstitutionsmaynotall applyto the small,community-run orphanagescommon inmanypartsofAfrica. Research by, amongothers, Kathryn Whetten ofDuke Univer-sityfound thatin eastAfrica (aswell asCambodia and India) children in such or-phanagesdo aswell asin familysettings—sometimesbetter. Anotherstudyfoundthatthose in Kenyan orphanagesare betteroﬀthan ifcared forbypoorrelatives.The aim ofclosingorphanagesmay becommendable. Butwhen done poorly, ashashappened in some instancesin Ethio-pia, Tanzania and Kenya, the burden isshifted onto familieswho cannotcope—and more children end up on the streets. 7Africa’s orphanagesPlease sir, I want ahomeMUHANGAClosing orphanages in Africa maybeless heartless than itseemsThinkin’ about tomorrowGRACE MUGABE, the ﬁrstladyofZim-babwe and an accomplished shopper,isno strangerto controversy, athome orabroad.

MrMac-ron’sratingshave tumbled amongthoseItmighthave helped ifMrMacron hadexplained himself. He doubtlessjudgedthatthere are greaterdangersin isolatingAmerica, and thatthe two countriesmayneed each other—overSyria, forinstance.Buthe hasdecided to pursue a “Jupiterian”presidency: he speakslittle in public, en-trustingthe dailyjob ofspin to his govern-ment. Where MrHollande gossiped to re-porters, MrMacron mostlyrefusesto talkto the press. Thisleavesimagesto speak forthemselves. Some have been easytargetsforridicule, such asthe presidentplayingTom Cruise in a ﬁghter-pilotsuit, or laugh-ingatthe Elysée Palace with Rihanna. Thissortofcriticism islegitimate in pol-itics, buta second type seemslessserious.Duringa special parliamentarysession,which ran into August—a time when muchofParishad leftforthe beach—some ﬁrst-time deputiesfrom MrMacron’sLa Répu-blique en Marche (LRM) proved accident-prone.

Butvotersstruggle to see whatthe countryhasse-cured in return. The presidentthen gave hisformermilitarychief, who had criticiseddefence cuts, a publicdressing-down. Thiswasintended asa showofauthority, butpublicopinion sided with the general,who resigned. AnothererrorwasMrMac-ron’seﬀortto codifyan oﬃcial role fortheFrench ﬁrstlady.

Theyslaughtered 15 peopleand injured some 130 from more than 30countries, mostofthem on Barcelona’sgreatboulevard, the Ramblas.ManySpaniardshad hoped to bespared. Theysuﬀered the murderof192people in the jihadistbombingoffourcommutertrainsin Madrid in 2004. Butoflate Spain hasplayed onlya minorrole inmilitaryoperationsin the Middle East andnorth Africa. Itssecurityservicesare eﬀec-tive, honed bylongexperience against theBasque terroristsofETA. The country’sMuslim population isproportionatelysmallerthan thatofmostofitsneighbours,and hasarrived more recently. Onlyaround 190 Spanish residentshave trav-elled to the Middle Eastto join IslamicState (IS), and onlyabout25 have returned.Reversing the reconquistaNone ofthathasmade Spain immune. IShasnotforgotten Al-Andalus, the Muslimcaliphate thatruled much ofthe countryduringthe Middle Ages. Spain, and espe-ciallyCatalonia, hostsmanySalaﬁsts, dev-oteesofan ultra-conservative brand ofSunni Islam; a minorityofitsadherents fa-vourviolentjihad. The authoritieshave re-centlyadopted a proactive policy, jailinghundredsofterroristsuspectson lessercharges(such asextremistpropaganda) be-fore theycould commitviolence. Adispro-portionatelylarge numberofthose arrestshave been in Catalonia, which hasbecome“the main site ofjihadistactivity” in Spain,accordingto Fernando Reinaresofthe El-cano Institute, a think-tank. The attackon August17th ﬁtsthe recentpattern ofjihadistterrorism in Europe. ItsleaderwasAbdelbaki esSatty, a Moroccanimmigrantradicalised while in jail for drugsmuggling. In 2015 he turned up astheimam ata mosque in Ripoll, a Catalantown atthe footofthe Pyrenees. EsSatty,who had contactsin both Belgium andFrance, secretlyrecruited a tight-knit groupofyoungmen who were notespeciallyre-ligious, includingfoursetsofbrothers.Spain rightlypridesitselfon its toler-ance towardsimmigrants. Mostofthe Ri-poll group had arrived from Morocco assmall children, and were apparentlywell-integrated. Theyspoke Catalan, had jobsand played in a local football team. Noneofthatwasenough to preventthem attack-ingtheiradopted country. There isa second reason whythe eventsofAugust17th pose unusuallysharp ques-tionsforSpain’spolitical leaders. Catalo-nia’sregional governmentisbenton orga-nisingan unconstitutional referendum onindependence on October1st. Should the“yes” side win, a unilateral declaration ofindependence will follow. The conserva-tive governmentofMariano Rajoyin Ma-drid isdetermined to stop the referendum.Both MrRajoyand CarlesPuigdemont,the pro-independence presidentofthe Cat-alan government, have been careful not topoliticise the attacks. (Theyhave learnedthe lessonsof2004, when the conservativegovernmentwronglyblamed the bomb-ingson ETA, helpingthe opposition Social-iststo win the election three dayslater.) MrRajoywentto Barcelona, metMrPuigde-montand called forunity. MrPuigdemontreciprocated: “Ourabsolute and sole prior-ityisto attend to the victimsand pursuethe criminals,” he declared.Yetthe underlyingpolitical tension hassurfaced in coded form. The Catalan policeforce, the Mossosd’Esquadra, responded ef-fectivelyto the attack: ofthe 12 men in-volved, sixwere killed bypolice, four ar-rested and two, includingesSatty, diedwhen theirimprovised bomb factoryblewup. (Hisoriginal plan wasapparently tobomb a Barcelona landmark, perhapstheSagrada Familia basilica.) Standingbesidehispolice chief, MrPuigdemonthailedtheirsuccessasevidence thatthe Mossosshould have a seatatinternational policeagencieslike Europol, implyingtheyhadbeen denied intelligence byMadrid. The Mossoshave recentlygained a rep-resentative atthe Spanish national oﬃceofEuropol. Butboth Europol and Interpolrecognise onlya single national counter-part, notesa formerpolice commander.The biggerproblem isinter-force rivalry inCatalonia. Since 2010 the Mossoshave hadcounter-terrorism responsibilities, whichtheyshare with Spain’snational policeand the Civil Guard, a paramilitarycorps.Each countsseveral thousand oﬃcers ex-perienced in tacklingterrorism. The Mos-sos’scurrentpolitical bosses“do notallowthem to interactnormally” with the na-tional forces, saysMrReinares. Others inMadrid have criticised the Mossosforfail-ingto detectesSatty’sactivities.IfMrPuigdemontwanted a pretext tobackdown from hisconfrontation withMadrid, he nowhasone. Butthere isnosign he will take it. The political truce isun-likelyto lastbeyond a march in Barcelonain tribute to the victimson August26th.Will the attackschange publicopinion to-wardsindependence? Foritssupporters, itisan emotional cause. In answerto thosewho see the referendum asa distraction—nowmore than ever—theywill claim thatCatalonia would be more secure alone. The attackshave produced a wave ofpublicsympathytowardsCatalonia in therestofSpain, afteryearsofgrowing es-trangement. An imaginative governmentmightbuild on thatto oﬀerthe Catalansmore recognition oftheirunique status asa“cultural nation”within Spain, some-thingMrRajoyhasresisted. Butthe coun-tryalso needsto thinkhard aboutwhat itoﬀersitsimmigrants, especiallyasthe sec-ond and third generationsgrowup.

Those who feel leftbehind are aboutto become more so. 7ONE ofthe thorniestissuesforBrexitwasalwaysgoingto be dispute reso-lution. Thisbecame more obviouslast Oc-toberwhen Theresa Maysetoutasone ofher“red lines” the demand thatBritainmustno longercome underthe jurisdic-tion ofthe European CourtofJustice (ECJ).The diﬃcultythisskatesaround isthat theECJisthe sole arbiterofEuropean Unionlaw. Thatmeansitcan touch on anypartici-pantin Britain’sbiggestexportdestination,the EU’ssingle market. JustaskbigAmeri-can ﬁrmslike Google orMicrosoftif theyare everaﬀected bythe ECJ’srulings.ItisnotclearwhyToryBrexiteersshould be so hostile to the court. Its rolewasnotan issue duringthe referendum. Ithasbeen exceedinglyhelpful to British in-terestsin itspolicingofthe single market,which a predecessorofMrsMay’sasprimeminister, MargaretThatcher, did so muchto create. And a lotofthe opprobrium overforeign judgesactuallyconcernsthe entire-lyseparate European CourtofHumanRights, ofwhich Britain will remain amembereven afterBrexit.Thisweekthe governmentpublishedtwo newpapersthatconcern the court:one on civil-justice co-operation and theotheron dispute resolution. Althoughministersdenyit, both marked a blurringofMrsMay’sred line bytalkingrepeatedlyonlyofescapingthe “direct” jurisdiction ofthe ECJ. The clearimplication isthat someindirectrole forthe courtisacceptable. The trickyquestion ishowthismightworkin practice. One possible answerfrom both papersisto followthe exampleofIceland, Liechtenstein, NorwayandSwitzerland asmembersofthe EuropeanFree Trade Association (EFTA). Forcivil andcommercial cases, the governmentrefersfavourablyto the Lugano convention,which governsjudicial co-operation be-tween the EUand EFTAcountries. And fordispute resolution, itcitesthe EFTAcourt.The EFTAcourtisindeed an interestingmodel. Itplaysan equivalentrole to the ECJforthe three countriesin the European Eco-nomicArea (EEA) thatare in the EU’ssinglemarket(Switzerland isin EFTA, butnottheEEA). Butunlike the ECJ, itsrulingsare advi-soryonly: theydo nothave directeﬀectand the courtcannotimpose ﬁnes. Its pres-ident, Carl Baudenbacher, ironicallyaSwisswhose courttherefore hasno juris-diction overhisown country(he wasnominated byLiechtenstein), saysitis alsomore sympatheticto English legal tradi-tions. Itisnotgoverned bythe EUgoal of“evercloserunion”. And itworksin Eng-lish, whereasthe ECJworksin French. The EFTAmodel hasdisadvantages,however. The biggestisthat, based as itisrightnextto the ECJin Luxembourg, itcloselyfollowsitsbiggerneighbour’sjuris-prudence. Itsrulingsmaybe advisory butin practice theymustbe accepted to pre-serve full accessto the single market. WereBritain to seekto “dock” into the EFTAcourt, asMrBaudenbachersuggests, itwould geta British judge—butstill be sub-jectto rulingsbyforeigners. Itmight alsohave to join EFTA, raisingquestionsoverwhetheritcould end the free movement ofpeople from the EU. All ofthismayexplainwhythe governmentisagainstusingtheEFTAcourtasan oﬀ-the-shelfanswer.Yetsettingup a similarbutwholly newcourtorarbitration tribunal maynot bestraightforward. AsCatherine Barnard ofCambridge University, who isalso in TheUKin a ChangingEurope, an academic net-work, pointsout, the ECJhasblocked plansfora speciﬁcEEAcourt, because itmightimpinge on itssole rightto interpret EUlaw.ButCharlesGrantofthe Centre forEuro-pean Reform, a think-tank, believesotherEUcountriesand the ECJ would acceptBritish use ofthe EFTAcourt.The biggerpointisthatthe closer areBritain’slinksto the single marketor to anyofthe EU’sregulatoryagenciesafterBrexit,the more itwill have to observe EUrules.And British courtswill go on referring toECJjudgmentseven afterBrexit, asjusticesofBritain’sSupreme Courthave madeclear.

Investmentin the carindustrythisyear isontrackto be lessthan halfitslevel in 2016, and a quarterthatin 2015. ManyBrexiteersregard temporarydisruption asa price worthpaying, forthe reasonsthatRand laid outin “AtlasShrugged”. TheEU isa giantbureaucracythatismore interested in regulating yes-terday’sindustriesthan inventingthe future, theyargue. Britain’sbestchance ofﬂourishingisto turn itselfinto a European Singa-pore and attractmobile industries.An inspiringvision, perhaps, butitsuﬀersfrom several pro-blems. The ﬁrstisthatthe EU isunlikelyto allowa Singapore toform on itsborders. Britain will face a choice between playingbyEuropean rulesand gettingaccessto European markets, or creat-ingitsown rulesand beingdenied accessto those markets.Thesecond isthatthe costofdisruption could be veryconsiderableindeed. Britain hasa current-accountdeﬁcitofaround 3% ofGDP.Italso hasan unusuallylarge “gross” balance-sheetbecause itis aglobal hub forbanksand holding-companies. Thismakesit sensi-tive to panicsresultingfrom disruptionsin the Brexit talks(suchasone side walkingoutin a huﬀ) or, worse, from Britain crashingoutwithouta deal. The third and mostimportantproblem is thelikelynextprime minister. Where Singapore had Lee Kuan Yew,Britain will have JeremyBernard Corbyn.MrCorbyn standson the verge ofpower. The Toryparty issodemented thatsome membersare rallyingbehind Jacob Rees-Mogg, a pantomime toﬀ, to succeed Theresa May. There is littlechance thatMrCorbyn would moderate hishard-leftism in gov-ernment. He hasbeen bangingthe same drumsfor30 years, andissurrounded byfellow-travellerssuch asJohn McDonnell, hisshadowchancellor, and SeumasMilne, hischiefstrategist, whosebiggestdisagreementisoverwhetherStalin orTrotskyis the great-erinspiration. He issupported bysnarlingactivistsin the Mo-mentum campaigninggroup and the Unite trade union.The laststrawHiselection islikelyto lead to the biggesttestofstrength betweenglobal marketsand a sovereign governmentsince François Mit-terrand proposed an extensive programme ofnationalisation onhiselection to the French presidencyin 1981. Mitterrand wasforced to backdown, butMrCorbyn maywell hold outfor longer.Hispoliticsare a deeperred than Mitterrand’s. He believesthatchange comesthrough conﬂictratherthan consensus, so will ex-pectthe marketsand media to tell him he isruiningthe country:that’swhatthe reactionaryestablishmentdoes. Asheavily in-debted renters, hisyoungsupportersmaynotmind surging inﬂa-tion and crashingpropertyprices.The combined resultofBrexitand Corbyn could be the dysto-pia thatRand warned about: a stagnantsocietydriven by resent-mentofthe successful. The ﬂightoftalentwill notonly have aknock-on eﬀecton the widereconomy, ashigh earnerswhowould have spentmoneyin London orLeedsstartmovingto Par-isorFrankfurt. Itwill also reduce the state’srevenues, since thetop 1% ofearnerspayalmost30% ofincome taxand the top 10%paynearly60%.MrCorbyn seemsto thinkthatall he need do istoask“the rich” to pay“a little bitmore” and everythingwill be ﬁne.Butwhywould successful people putup with highertaxes, par-ticularlyiftheyfollowon the heelsofBrexit-related uncertaintyand disruption?

In Bangladesh 65-77% ofvis-itsare to informal providers. In Thailandthe share is55-77%, in Nigeria 36-49% and inKenya 33%. Marketsforthistype ofcare are muchfreerthan in rich countries. Providers aretypicallypaid directlybythe patient.Abouta third oftotal health spendingglob-allyispaid outofpocket; in India the shareiscloserto 70%.Dozensofstudieshave tried to workoutwhetherpublicorprivate clinics do abetterjob ofprovidingprimarycare, with-outmuch success. Two systematicreviewspublished in the pasttwo yearsused manyofthe same papers—and came to oppositeconclusions. Mostofthe research hasfailed to considerwhatactuallyhappensin clinics. Buta fewresearchershave used“standardised patients”—people coachedto describe symptomsofspeciﬁcailments,forexample angina, orto saythattheyhave a child athome with diarrhoea. After-wardsresearchersquizthe mockpatientsand assessthe qualityoftheirtreatment.The resultsare startling. In India the av-erage consultation lasted three minutes, aquarteraslongasin OECDcountries. Athird lasted lessthan a minute and in-volved no examination and justone ques-tion from the clinician: “What’swrongwith you?” The correcttreatmentwasgiv-en in 30% ofcases, and unnecessaryorharmful treatmentin 42%. Patientsfare little betterin China. Ateam led bySean Sylvia ofRenmin Univer-sityofChina sentstandardised patients toclinicsin Shaanxi province. Health work-ersspentan average of96 secondswith pa-tients. Theygave a correctdiagnosis in just26% ofcases, and an outrightwrongone in41%. Inepttreatmentisnotbecause provid-ersare too busy. Accordingto the WorldBank, in India, Kenya, Senegal and Tanza-nia each one seesjusteightto ten patients aday. Those in India spentjust40 minutesadayon average seeingpatients. Abetterexplanation startswith the factthatmanyclinicianshave received littletrainingand do notknowwhattheyaredoing. In India and China more medicaltrainingis(reassuringly) associated withmakingfewermistakes. And a recentKen-yan studyusingstandardised patientsfound thatcliniciansin Nairobi made “sig-niﬁcantlybetter” diagnosesthan Indianand Chinese ones, who had lesstraining.One reason Brazil and Costa Rica havebetterhealth-care systemsthan othercountriesofsimilarincome istheirdensenetworksoftrained primary-care workers.In Costa Rica, local teamsincludinga doc-torand a nurse provide three-quarters ofconsultations. The country, which spendslessthan the global average on health care($970 perperson), hasthe third-highest lifeexpectancyin the Americas, behind onlyCanada and Chile. Itsrate ofmaternalmortalityislowerthan America’s.Costa Rica’shealth-care system issmalland well-structured. Copyingitin India,with itschaoticmixofpublicand privateproviders, would be impractical. Butan al-ternative—upgradinginformal providersbygivingthem some basictraining—is un-popularwith medics. “Teachingburglarshowto steal more eﬀectively” ishowa for-merchairman ofone Indian doctors’ asso-ciation putsit. Yetitseemsto work. Arecentstudyin WestBengal found thata nine-month trainingscheme costing$175 perperson improved the share ofcasesman-aged correctlybyeightpercentage points. Technologycan help, too. Each mohallaclinicisequipped with a Swasthya Slate, arelativelycheap ($640) device thatcan per-form 33 common medical tests, includingmeasuringblood pressure and blood-sug-arlevels. In Rwanda, Babylon, a British dig-ital health company, istestinga Kigali-widetelemedicine service, which allowspa-tientsto call a doctorand geta quick re-sponse ratherthan queue in a hospital. Buteven when providershave thetrainingand technologyto followthe cor-rectprocedures, theyoften do not. The“know-do” gap isevidentfrom studies thatcompare whatclinicianstold researchersabouthowtheywould treata hypotheticalcase with theiractual dealingswith stan-dardised patients(see chart). In one study74% ofIndian cliniciansdescribed the cor-rectwayto handle patientswith angina,asthma ordiarrhoea. Butin realityjust 31%acted correctly. There waslittle overall dif-ference in qualitybetween publicand priv-ate providers—though the same providerdelivered a betterservice when paid di-rectlythan when doingpublic-sectorwork.The know-do gap appearsto be largestforqualiﬁed doctors, suggestingitcannotbe closed bytrainingalone. Attempts toimprove primarycare musttake accountofthe incentivesthatinﬂuence what doc-torsdo. Forexample, in patient-clinician re-lationshipsthere isan asymmetryofinfor-mation: patientsknowtheyare ill but notwhy, orwhatthe rightcure is. Thatcan en-courage them to demand prescriptionseven when theyare notneeded. Andwhen health-care workerscan proﬁtfromthatmismatch, theyoften take thatchance. QuackattackIn China, forexample, until recently doc-torsoften shared in the revenuesfrom pre-scriptions. Thatled to rampantoveruse ofantibiotics. Chinese studiesbyJanet Cur-rie, ofPrinceton University, and Wan-chuan Lin, ofPekingUniversity, used stan-dardised patientswith ﬂu-like symptomswho, since theirsymptomssuggested theywere suﬀeringfrom a virus, did notneedantibiotics. Yet63% ofdoctorsprescribedthem. Thatfell to 43% when patientsmen-tioned thattheyhad read thatantibioticsare notalwayssuitable in such cases—andto 12%when theysaid theywould buytheantibioticsfrom a relative’spharmacy. Fortunately, incentivescan also be usedto make primarycare better. In Rwanda ascheme thatrewardshealth workersforstickingto clinical recommendationshasbeen found to narrowthe know-do gap. InThailand, doctorsare oﬀered ﬁnancial in-centivesto workin rural clinics. Astudypublished in Januaryfound thatgiving res-identsofa Ugandan village informationaboutwhatto expectfrom theirclinic ledto betterservices. Research into howto improve primarycare in poorcountries, whetherprovidedbythe marketorthe state, isstill in itsinfan-cy. Butbypullingbackthe curtain of the ex-amination room itisbeginningto showwhypatientsoften do notgetthe care theyneed. One vital implication isthat, as MrDassays, “doctorsare neitherdemonsnorangels. Theyare human.” 7Time for a second opinionSource: Jishnu Das et al.India, Madhya Pradesh, treatment patternsClinicians following recommended procedures, 2010-11, %020406080100All providersNon-doctorsPrivate doctorsPublic doctorsIn interviews with researchers In consultations with mock patients The doctor will see you nowThe EconomistAugust26th201751For daily coverage of business, visitEconomist.com/business-ﬁnance 1LEAVE itto the Americansto besiege Euro-pean companiesin August, when theentire continentison holiday.

Yet AIwillalso create demand forothertypesof digi-tal work. The technologymayuse a lot ofcomputingpowerand fancymathematics,butitalso relieson data distilled by hu-mans. Forautonomouscarsto recogniseroad signsand pedestrians, algorithmsmustbe trained byfeedingthem lotsofvideo showingboth. Thatfootage needs tobe manually“tagged”, meaningthatroadsignsand pedestrianshave to be marked assuch. Thislabellingalreadykeepsthou-sandsbusy. Once an algorithm isputtowork, humansmustcheckwhetheritdoesagood job and give feedbackto improve it. Aservice oﬀered byCrowdFlower, amicro-taskstartup, isan example ofwhat iscalled “human in the loop”. Digital work-ersclassifye-mail queriesfrom consumers,forinstance, bycontent, sentimentandothercriteria. These data are fed throughan algorithm, which can handle mostofthe queries. Butquestionswith no simpleanswerare again routed through humans. Youmightexpecthumansto be takenoutofthe loop asalgorithmsimprove.

Atravel agency, forinstance, mightuse AIto deal with routine tasks(such asbookinga ﬂight), butdirectthe more com-plicated ones(a requestto create a custo-mised citytour, say) to humans.Michael Bernstein ofStanford Universi-tyseesthingsgoingeven further. He antici-patesthe rise oftemporary“ﬁrms” whosestaﬀare hired online and conﬁgured withthe help ofAI. To testthe idea, MrBernsteinand histeam developed a program to as-semble such virtual companiesforspeciﬁcprojects—forinstance, recruitingworkersand assigningthem tasksin orderto designasmartphone app to reportinjuriesfroman ambulance racingto a hospital. Workingin such “ﬂash organisations”could well be fun. Butmanyfearthat thehuman cloud will create a global digitalproletariat.

Even in basicin-dustries, such ascement, returnshave been relativelyhigh.Thisrecord reﬂectsgood management: mostﬁrmsknow howto allocate capital well, unlike theirproﬂigate Chinese peers. ButIndia’sinformalityand bad infrastructure also create obstaclesfornewentrants. Inputssuch ascapital, land and energy can benightmarishlyhard to secure.

Ifthere isa central question in macro-economics, thisisit. There are fewbiggerwastesthan the lossto idlenessofhours,daysand yearsbypeople who would rath-erbe working. Unemploymentcan ruinlives, sinkbudgetsand topple govern-ments. Yetpolicymakersdo notwage all-outwaron joblessness. Most, like the Fed-eral Reserve, America’scentral bank, targetwhatisknown asunemployment’s“natu-ral” rate, atwhich inﬂation isstable. The importance ofthisconceptis hardto overstate. The Fed’sargumentforitsre-centinterest-rate rises, forexample, hingeson stoppingunemploymentfrom fallingtoo farbeneath the natural rate. Yet the nat-ural rate isin manyrespectsan article offaith, alwayssoughtbutneverseen. Wheredoesitcome from?There are several reasonswhyunem-ploymentcannotsimplybe eradicatedfully. Ittakestime forpeople to move fromone job to another: thisissaid to cause“frictional” unemployment. Ifpeople can-notﬁnd jobsbecause theyhave outdatedskills—thinkhand weaversafterthe inven-tion ofthe loom—theymightbecome“structurally” unemployed. Butitisthe trade-oﬀbetween unem-ploymentand inﬂation thatmostpreoccu-piescentral bankers. John MaynardKeynes, the greatBritish economist, took aﬁrststep towardsthe natural-rate hypothe-siswhen he focused mindson “involun-tary” unemployment. In hisbook“TheGeneral Theory”, published in 1936 in theaftermath ofthe Depression, Keynesnotedthatmanypeople could notﬁnd jobsat thegoingwage, even iftheyhad comparableskillsto those in work. Classical economicsblamed artiﬁciallyhigh wages, perhapscaused bytrade unions. ButKeynespoint-ed to lacklustre economy-wide spending.Even ifwagesfell, he reasoned, workerswould have lessto spend, makingthe de-mand deﬁciencyworse. The answer, hethought, wasforgovernmentsto manageaggregate demand in orderto keep em-ployment“full”.Keyneswasnotthe fatherofall that isnowthoughtofas“Keynesian”. Inﬂation,forinstance, barelyentered hisanalysis ofunemployment. Butbythe late 1960sKey-nesianism had become associated withthe idea thatwhen managingaggregate de-mand, policymakersare notjustchoosingarate ofunemployment. Theyare simulta-neouslychoosinghowfastpricesrise. The relationship between inﬂation andunemploymentwasﬁrststudied byIrvingFisherin 1926. Butthe “Phillipscurve”, asitcame to be known, owesitsname to astudyin 1958 byWilliam PhillipsoftheLondon School ofEconomics. In hisstudy,Phillipstraced the relationship betweenunemploymentand wage growth in Brit-ain overthe course ofalmosta century. Hefound thatfrom 1861to 1957 the relation-ship had been prettystable: the lower theunemploymentrate, the fasterwagesrose.Thiswasremarkable, given the changesoverthatperiod in workers’ rights. In 1861mostworkerscould notvote; by1957 thepost-warLabourgovernmenthad nation-alised much ofthe economy. Paul Samuelson and RobertSolow, twoothereconomicluminaries, subsequentlyinvestigated the relationship in America,and reported thatthere wasno such stabil-itythere. The Phillipscurve shifted around.Butin anygiven era, Samuelson and So-lowwrote, “wage ratesdo tend to risewhen the labourmarketistight, and thetighterthe faster.” Theydescribed the rela-tionship asa “menu”, encouragingthe ideathatthe job ofKeynesian policymakerswasto picka pointon the curve that bestaligned with theirpreferences. Howlowunemploymentcould fall, in otherwords,depended onlyon whatlevel ofinﬂationwastolerable (forrisingwageswouldsurelyend up liftingprices, too). Itisunclearwhetherpolicymakers ac-tuallythoughtofthe relationship betweeninﬂation and unemploymentasa menu.Butthe idea wasprominentenough bythelate 1960sto attractwitheringcriticism. Itstwo main detractors, Edmund PhelpsandMilton Friedman, would each go on to winaNobel prize. MrPhelpsbegan writinggroundbreak-ingmodelsofthe labourmarketin 1966. Ayearlater, Friedman gave whatbecame thecanonical criticism ofthe old wayof think-ingin an addressto the American Econom-icsAssociation. In it, he argued that, farfrom there beinga menuofoptionsforpolicymakersto pickfrom, one rate of un-employment—a natural rate—would even-tuallyprevail.Suppose, Friedman reasoned, thatacentral bankprintsmoneyin an attempt to The natural rate of unemploymentCentral bankers’ holygrailPolicymakers have spenthalfa centuryin search ofthe natural rate ofunemployment.

Alargermoneysupplywould leadto more spending. Firmswould respond toincreased demand fortheirproductsby ex-pandingproduction and raisingprices, sayby5%. Thisinﬂation would catch workersbysurprise. Theirwageswould be worthlessthan theybargained forwhen theyhad negotiated theircontracts. Labourwould, fora while, be artiﬁciallycheap, en-couraginghiring. Unemploymentwouldfall belowthe natural rate. The centralbankwould achieve itsgoal.The nexttime paywasnegotiated, how-ever, workerswould demand a 5% raise torestore theirstandard ofliving. Neitherﬁrm norworkerhasgained orlostnegotiat-ingpowersince the lasttime real wageswere set, so the natural rate ofunemploy-mentwould reassertitselfasﬁrmsshedstaﬀto payforthe raise. To getunemploy-mentbackdown again, the central bankcould embarkon anotherround ofeasing.Butworkerscan be fooled onlyforso long.Theywould come to expect5% inﬂation,and would insiston commensuratelyhigherwagesin advance, ratherthan play-ingcatch-up with the central bank. With-outan inﬂation surprise, there would beno period ofunexpectedlycheap labour.So unemploymentwould notfall.The implication? Fora central bank tokeep unemploymentbelowthe naturalrate, itmustkeep outdoingitself, deliveringinﬂation surprise afterinﬂation surprise.Hence, Friedman reasoned, Keynesianswere wrongto pin a lowrate ofunemploy-mentto a given, high rate ofinﬂation. Tosustain unemploymenteven a little belowthe natural rate, inﬂation would need to ac-celerate yearin, yearout. Friedman’sandPhelps’snatural rate became known asthe“non-acceleratinginﬂation rate ofunem-ployment” (NAIRU). No societycould tolerate endlessly ris-ing, orfalling, inﬂation. Phillipshad ob-served a correlation in the data, but itwasnotone thatpolicymakerscould exploit inthe longrun. “There isalwaysa temporarytrade-oﬀbetween inﬂation and unem-ployment,” Friedman said. “There isnopermanenttrade-oﬀ.” Nearly50 yearson,thatremainsthe premise on which rich-world central banksoperate. When oﬃ-cialstalkaboutthe Phillipscurve, theymean Friedman’stemporarytrade-oﬀ. Inthe longrun, theybelieve, unemploymentwill come to restatthe natural rate.The idea hassuch inﬂuence partly be-cause Friedman’sand Phelps’scontribu-tionswere so well timed. Before 1968,America had had two yearswith unem-ploymentbelow4% and inﬂation below3%. Butwhen Friedman spoke, priceswereindeed accelerating; inﬂation rose to 4.2%in 1968. The nextyearithit5.4% even asun-employmentchanged little. The “stagﬂa-tion” ofthe 1970skilled oﬀthe idea ofa sta-ble Phillipscurve. Successive shocks to oilprices, in 1973 and 1979, sentboth inﬂationand unemploymentsurging. In 1975 bothwere above 8%; in 1980 inﬂation hit13.5%even asunemploymentexceeded 7%. Theidea ofthe NAIRUlooked a little shaky, too;inﬂation wasmeantto fall so longas un-employmentwastoo high. ButFriedman’sfollowerscould argue thatbad supply-sidepolicies, in conjunction with the oil-priceshocks, had pushed the NAIRUup. Around the same time, however, theconceptofthe NAIRUcame underattackfrom theorists. Itwasbuilt, in part, on theidea thatinﬂation expectationsare “adap-tive”: to predictinﬂation, ﬁrmsand work-erslookatitscurrentvalue. Butthe doc-trine of“rational expectations” decreedthatﬁrmsand consumerswould, to thegreatestextentpossible, anticipate policy-makers’ actions. Wheneverthe publicsus-pected thatcentral bankerswould try topush employmentbelowthe natural rate,inﬂation would rise immediately. On theotherhand, a credible promise notto seekanyunsustainable jobsboomsshouldkeep inﬂation undercontrol, simplyby“anchoring” expectations. Thatproposition wasputto the testafterPaul Volckerbecame Fed chairman in1979. MrVolckerwasseton gettinginﬂationdown. Asitturned out, he would need toprove hismettle. Histightmonetarypoli-cies—the federal fundsrate reached almost20% in 1981—contributed to a double-dip re-cession, which pushed unemploymentabove 10%. Itgotthe job done; inﬂationtumbled. Since MrVolcker’stime attheFed, ithasrarelyexceeded 5%.To thisday, some economistspoint tothe Volckerrecessionsasproofthatinﬂa-tion expectationsare adaptive. The publicdid notbelieve inﬂation would fall just be-cause the Fed said itwould. America hadto suﬀerhigh unemploymentto bringin-ﬂation down. Policymakershad to grapplewith a short-term Phillipscurve after all, asFriedman and Phelpshad argued. Yetthe experience ofthe 1980swouldnotbe repeated. In the decadesthatfol-lowed, central bankscommitted to inﬂa-tion targets. Astheygained credibility, thetrade-oﬀbetween inﬂation and unem-ploymentweakened. Economistswrote“NewKeynesian” modelsincorporatingrational expectations. Bythe mid-2000ssome ofthese modelsshowed a “divinecoincidence”: targetingthe bestpossiblepath forinﬂation, afteran economic shock,would also resultin the bestpossible pathforunemployment.Feweconomiststhinkthe divine coinci-dence holdsin practice. NewKeynesianmodelsusuallystruggle to explain realityunlesstheyare tweaked to incorporate, forexample, atleastsome people with adap-tive expectations. Acursoryexaminationofthe data suggestsexpectationsfollow in-ﬂation (theysank, forinstance, after oilpricesfell in late-2014).Odd jobsInﬂation hasbehaved strangelyoverthepastdecade. The recession thatfollowedthe ﬁnancial crisisof2007-08 sentAmeri-can unemploymentsoaringto 10%. Butun-derlyinginﬂation fell below1% onlybrief-ly—nothinglike the fall thatmodelspredicted. Because the onlywayecono-mistscan estimate the natural rate is bywatchinghowinﬂation and unemploy-mentmove in reality, theyassumed thatthe natural rate had risen (an estimate in2013 byRobertGordon, ofNorthwesternUniversity, putitat6.5%). Yetaslabourmar-ketshave tightened—unemploymentwas4.3% in July—inﬂation hasremained quies-cent. Estimatesofthe natural rate havebeen revised backdown. Such volatilityin estimatesofthe natu-ral rate limitsitsusefulnessto policymak-ers. Some argue thatthe wrongdata are be-ingused, because the unemploymentrateexcludesthose who have stopped lookingforwork. Otherssaythatthe short-termPhillipscurve hasﬂattened asinﬂation ex-pectationshave become evermore ﬁrmlyanchored. The question is: howlongwilltheyremain so? So longaslowunemploy-mentfailsto generate enough inﬂation,central bankswill face pressure to keep ap-plyingstimulus. Theiroﬃcialsworry thatifinﬂation suddenlysurges, theymightlose theirhard-won credibilityand end upbackin 1980, havingto create a recession togetinﬂation backdown again.Thisrecentexperience hasled some todoubtthe veryexistence ofthe natural rateofunemployment. Butto rejectthe naturalrate entirely, youwould need to believeone oftwo things. Eithercentral banks can-notinﬂuence the rate ofunemploymenteven in the shortterm, ortheycan peg un-employmentaslowastheylike—zero,even—withoutsparkinginﬂation. Neitherclaim iscredible.

Stockmarketindiceswere devised as ameasure ofthe overall market, againstwhich those tradingin sharescould com-pare theirperformance. Atﬁrstthey wereconcocted bythe pressorbyexchangesthemselves. Forbonds, indiceswere com-piled bythe banksthattraded them.

S&PDowJonesreckons$4.2trn in assetsare in-vested in “passive” fundsthattrackitsindi-ces, with $3trn assigned justto the S&P500.Another$7.5trn in activelymanaged assetsuse itsindicesas“benchmarks”: thatis,theymeasure theirperformance againstthem. The two otherbigindex-providerscommand similarlyvastsums: $15trn in ac-funds. And though some smallercompeti-torssurvive, the indexindustryisbecom-ingmore concentrated. Manybankshavequitthe bond-indexbusiness, selling theirbrands. Bloombergacquired Barclays’ indi-ceslastyear; FTSE Russell hasnearlycom-pleted the purchase ofCitigroup’s.Despite harpingon the objectivity andtransparencyoftheirrules, moreover,manyofthe decisionsthatindexprovidersmake are, ultimately, subjective. Take thedecision in June byMSCIto include Chi-nese sharesin itsemerging-marketsequityindex(followed byaround $1.6trn in as-sets). Shareslisted in mainland China hadbeen excluded because ofthe opacityofChina’scapital markets, and the restric-tionsforeignersface there. China’scapitalcontrolsremain in place, but, afterconsult-ingmarketparticipants, MSCIdecided toinclude the shares—albeitata weighting ofonly0.73% (and even thatin two phases) soasnotto disruptthe index’scompositiontoo quickly.Snap slappedSimilarly, both FTSERussell and S&P, in thewake ofSnap’slistingon the NewYorkStockExchange in March, chose to altertheirrulesto exclude companiesthat listonlynon-votingshares(asthe tech ﬁrmdid). Thisstemmed partlyfrom pressurefrom investorssuch asNorway’ssover-eign-wealth fund. FTSERussell said thatthe majorityofassetmanagersitconsultedwanted a company’ssharesto be includedin an indexonlyifthe votingpowerofstockmarketinvestorspassed a thresholdof25%, butthe index-makeropted foralowerminimum of5% and a gradualphase-in, again to avoid disruption. The composition ofbond indiceshasalso come underscrutiny. Earlierthis year,J.P.

AlexMatturri, head ofS&PDowJones, pointsoutthateventhough assetsin exchange-traded funds(ETFs), virtuallyall ofwhich are passive,have reached $4trn globally, thatisonly a“small partofthe global investable uni-verse” (estimated ataround $300trn). MrMatturri also emphasisesthe transparencyand “rules-driven approach” ofindexcon-struction and governance. Bigchanges aremade onlyafterconsultingthe market.Moreover, arguesMarkMakepeace,chiefexecutive ofFTSERussell, index-mak-ingremainsverycompetitive. Some small-erproviders, such asMorningstar, giveawaydata on mostoftheirindices(on theweightingsoftheircomponents, forexam-ple).

Todaywage growth seemsstuckatabout2.5%. Thispuzzlesecono-mists. Some saythe labourmarketislesshealthythan the joblessrate suggests; oth-erspointto weakproductivitygrowth orlowinﬂation expectations. The latest ideaisto blame retiringbaby-boomers.The thinkinggoesasfollows. The aver-age workergainsskillsand seniority, andhence higherpay, overtime. When he re-tires, hishigh-payingjob will vanish un-lessa similarly-seasoned workeriswaitingin the wings. Aﬂurryofretirements couldtherefore putdownward pressure on aver-age wages, howeverwell the economydoes. The ﬁrstbaby-boomersbegan to hitretirementage around 2007, justasthe ﬁ-nancial crisisstarted. And since 2010, theﬁrstfull yearofthe recovery, the number ofmiddle-aged workershasshrunkconsider-ably. Theyhave been replaced partlybylower-earningyoungsters(see chart).Researchersatthe Federal Reserve BankofSan Francisco thinkthiscould explaindisappointingwage growth overthatper-iod. Theysplitearningsgrowth into theportion caused bypayrises, and the por-tion caused bypeople joiningorleavingthe workforce. From mid-2012 until recent-ly, changesto labour-force compositionhave reduced income growth byabouttwo percentage points. Bycomparison, inearly2007 the dragwaslessthan one per-centage point. Forthose in workcontinu-ously, payisrisingjustasfastasit wasthen.Doesthatmean the labourmarketisrunninghot? Notso fast, saysAdam Ozi-mekofMoody’sAnalytics. He pointsoutthatthe numberofworkersaged over55 isgrowing, notshrinking, asa fraction oftheworkforce. Whatismore, statistically con-trollingforageingbarelychangesesti-matesofaggregate wage growth, accordingto hismodel.So whatisgoingon? The San FranciscoFed’sresearchersalso note thatmany lowearnershave recentlyjoined the labourforce (such workersare usuallythe last tobeneﬁtfrom economicexpansions).Growth in low-skilled jobscan hold backaverage wage growth. Butthisexplanationdoesnotimplythatthe labourmarket hasfullyrecovered, because more people mayyetbe tempted to lookfora job. In fact, MrOzimekdeniesthere isa wage puzzle to be-gin with. Replace the unemploymentrate,which countsonlythose who are seekingwork, with the fraction of25-to-54-year-oldswho are jobless, and wage growth isexactlywhere youwould expectitto be (atleastaccordingto MrOzimek’spreferredmeasure ofpayand beneﬁts).Anotherproblem with the ageingex-planation isthatitisnotjustwage growththathasbeen disappointing.

Butitisonlyone ofthe bargains thatap-parentlylitterthe internet: YouTube watchersdevour1bn hoursofvideoseveryday, forinstance. These free lunchesdo come atacost; the problem iscalculatinghowmuch itis. Because consum-ersdo notpayformanydigital servicesin cash, beyond the costofan internetconnection, economistscannottreatthese exchangeslike normal transactions. The economicsoffree are diﬀerent. Unlike conventional merchants, companieslike Facebookand Google have theirusersthemselvesproduce value. Informa-tion and picturesuploaded to social networksdrawothers to thesite. Online searches, selectionsand “likes” teach algorithmswhatpeople want. (Nowyou’ve bought“The CommunistMani-festo”, howabouta copyof“DasKapital”?)The prevalence offree servicesispartlya resultof history. Inthe earlyyearsofthe internet, consumersbecame used to gettingstuﬀfornothing. Theyhave little idea ofhowmuch their data areworth; since digital companieshave accessto billionsof people,the value ofone person’sdata istinyanyway. More fundamental-ly, scarcityisnota constraintin the digital world as itisin thephysical one. Data are both inexhaustible and super-cheap totransport. In 1993 MCIMail waschargingpeople 50 centsfortheﬁrst500 charactersofa digital message, increasingbyten centsforeach extra 500. The internetslashed thatprice to zero. Chargingwould have been impractical, so small isthe marginal cost.Usersmaypaynothing, butcompanieslike Google and Face-bookhave ﬁxed coststo cover: engineers, data centres, etc. Tomake money, theysqueeze theirusersindirectly, bychargingcompaniesto putappropriate advertisementsin frontof captiveeyeballs. In the second quarterof2017, Facebookeked an averageof$4.65 outofeach ofitsusersbypepperingscreenswith adsandpromoted posts. (Bycomparison, justeightcentscame from pay-mentsand otherfees, mainlyfrom people payingforstuﬀ withinvirtual games.) In the absence ofprices, economistsstruggle to work outwhatpeople are gettingbackwhen theybartertheirdata and attentionfordigital services. Some evidence suggeststhattheyare doingratherwell. ArecentstudybyErikBrynjolfsson, Felix EggersandAvinash Gannameneni ofthe MassachusettsInstitute ofTech-nologyoﬀered people diﬀerentcash amountsin exchange forgiv-ingup Facebookfora month. Based on the responses, they thenestimated itsaverage annual value to the consumerataround$750. Asimplersurveyin the same study(withoutreal cash of-fers) suggested thaton average people value free search enginesat$16,600 peryear, mapsat$2,800 and video at$900. Thissoundslike a wonderful deal forthe consumer, but itgen-eratesproblemselsewhere. Take taxes. Professionalsare notal-lowed to evade taxbysellingtheirservicesforbeneﬁts in kind, sowhyshould consumersnotbe taxed iftheyare paid fortheir datain the form ofservices? Statisticiansalso struggle in a post-priceworld. GDPismostlymeasured bytransactionsatmarketprices.ArecentstudybyLeonard Nakamura ofthe Federal Reserve BankofPhiladelphia and Jon Samuelsand Rachel Soloveichikof theBureauofEconomicAnalysisused the amountspenton advertis-ingto estimate uncounted output, and calculated thatin 2013AmericanGDPshould have been $19bn higherthan reported.Privacyactivistsalso worry. Consumerstend to respondmuch more stronglyto “free” oﬀersthan to pricesthatare onlyfractionallyhigherthan zero. When Amazon ﬁrstoﬀered freeshippingin European countries, orderssurged—butnotin France,where bymistake itcharged around ten cents. The activists’ con-cern isthatthe “free” label fosterspoordecisions, makingpeople,forexample, reveal more aboutthemselvesthan theywould in amore formal exchange. Researcherstalkofthe “privacyparadox”:when asked, people saythattheycare much more abouttheir pri-vacythan theiractionswould suggest. The free economyalso troublescompetition authorities. Ex-cessive marketpowercan be deﬁned asthe abilityto raise pricesabove whatwould be charged in a competitive market. With nopricesto compare, and otheroptionsonlya clickaway, compa-niessuch asGoogle seem to operate in an environmentof cut-throatcompetition. Itisnaive to thinkso. Consumersare morecaptive than the lowcostofswitchingmightimply. Google, forex-ample, commandsa marketshare forinternetsearch ofover 90%in mostcountriesin the European Union, where antitrust au-thoritiesin June ﬁned it€2.4bn ($2.7bn) forpromotingitsowncomparison shoppingservicesabove itscompetitors’. Itsservicesmayhave been free, butthe trustbustersjudged thatits marketpowerwascurbingconsumers’ choices. In the absence ofprices,lackofcompetition will showup in otherways: demandingmore information from usersthan theywantto give, for example;orirritatingthem bystuﬃngtheirservice chock-full ofadverts. No such thing as a free exchangeOpinion isdivided on whetherthe free economyneedsﬁxing,and ifso, how. In hisbook“Who Ownsthe Future?”, Jaron Laniersuggeststhattinypaymentsfordigital contributionsmight cor-rectyetanotherproblem, a misallocation oflabour. If companiespaid people foruseful data, ratherthan moppingup what theyleave behind astheyuse online services, then pricescould nudgepeople towardsmore productive online activity. Othersadvocatetougherregulation, mandatingthatconsumershave the optionofpayingfora version oftheirsocial-media platforms free ofad-vertisementsand digital proﬁles.

Theoldestleatherartefactfound so far isa5,500-year-old shoe from a cave in Arme-nia, butpaintingsin Egyptian tombsshowthat, 7,000 yearsago, leatherwasbeingturned into all mannerofthings, from san-dalsto bucketsto militaryequipment. Itisafairbetthatthe use ofanimal skins forshelterand clothinggoesbackhundreds ofthousandsofyearsatleast. Leathermakingisalso, though, a nastybusiness. In 18th-centuryLondon the soak-ingofputrefyinghidesin urine and lime, toloosen anyremainingﬂesh and hair, andthe subsequentpoundingofdogfaecesinto those skinsto soften and preservethem, caused such a stench thatthe busi-nesswasoutlawed from the Cityproperand forced downwind and acrossthe riverinto Bermondsey. In countriessuch as In-dia and Japan, the trade tainted people aswell asplacesand was(and often still re-mains) the preserve ofsocial outcasts suchasDalitsand Burakumin.Modern production methodsare lessstomach-turningthan those ofthe 18thcentury. Dogturds, lime and urine havebeen replaced bychromium and otherchemicals. Butsome ofthose replace-mentsare, themselves, prettycaustic sub-stances. And the whole leatherindustry,based asitison animal hides, isvulnerablethese daysto sensibilitiesaboutthe rela-tionship between human beingsand othermals. One isthatitcan be made in conve-nientsheetswith straightedges, ratherthan beingconstrained bythe irregularshapesthatanimalscome in. Anotheristhatitismore consistentthan the naturalstuﬀ. Itisdevoid ofthe scars, marks andotherdefectsto which real skin isinevita-blyprone. Nordoesitvaryfrom animal toanimal in the waythatnatural leatherdoes. All these factsreduce waste and im-prove quality. Theywill also, presumably,please those who feel thatanimalsshouldnothave to die in orderthatpeople canhave nice shoesand plush seatcovers.To produce itsleather, Modern Mead-owbeginswith a strain ofyeastthat hasbeen geneticallyengineered to make a pro-tein identical to bovine collagen. Collagenisthe principal structural protein in animalbodies. In particular, itgivesstrength andelasticityto skin. Itconsistsoflong chainsofamino-acids, the buildingblocksof allproteins, wound togetherin threesomes toform triple-helicesthatare then, in turn,wound togetherto make ﬁbres.In animal skinsboth the synthesis ofthe initial amino-acid chainsand their sub-sequentwindinginto ﬁbresare done byspecial cellscalled ﬁbroblasts. One crucialtrickModern Meadow’sbioengineershave mastered, though theyare reluctantto talkaboutthe details, isencouraging thechainsspatoutbythe yeastto assemblethemselvesinto ﬁbreswithoutthe inter-vention ofﬁbroblasts. Once the ﬁbres arethere, though, itisnottoo hard to persuadethem to organise themselvesinto layersthatare, to all intentsand purposes, sheetsofrawleather. These can then go for tan-ning, dyeingand ﬁnishingin the usual way.Accordingto Dave Williamson, thecompany’schieftechnologyoﬃcer, thisprocesshasbeen designed so thatitcan bescaled up easilyand carried outin existing animalsthatwould scarcelyhave crossedpeoples’ mindsin formeryears. Setagainstthese considerationsisa commercial one:leather, prized foritsdurabilityand supple-ness, isa businessworth $100bn a year. These contrastingfactsmake leathermanufacturinga temptingtargetfortech-nological disruption. And tanned animalskinsare indeed aboutto face a rival. Thechallenge comesnot, asmightbe assumed,from a substitute made ofsyntheticpo-lymer, butratherfrom somethingwhich is,in mostrespects, the same asnatural leath-er. The diﬀerence isthat, instead of comingfrom an animal’sback, thisleatherisgrown, bythe metre, in factories.

DrWilliamson used toworkforDuPont, a bigchemicalsﬁrm, sohe haslotsofexperience with such equip-ment. Itwould also be possible, he ob-serves, to make the collagen in large, cen-tral facilitiesand then transportit to localfactoriesand tanneriesforconversion intohide. Asto cost, the newmaterial will, hesays, be competitive with natural leather. One otheradvantage ofModern Mead-ow’smanufacturingprocessisthatit per-mitsdiﬀerentpartsofa sheetto be givendiﬀerentproperties. Thatcan change boththe lookand the feel ofthe productin con-trolled ways. One area might, forinstance,be made stiﬀwhile anotherismade soft.Thiswould allowthe newfangled “hides”to be custom-builtforparticulardesigns ofshoe. The processcould also be tweaked,though the companyhasannounced noplansto do so, to expand beyond cowhides, byencodingothertypesofcollagenin the yeast. Thatwould permitanaloguesofspecialistleathers, such asostrich oralli-gator, to be grown. Modern Meadowisnot, DrWilliamsonsays, actuallyoutto ape leather. Rather, theﬁrm’saim isto produce a newmaterial initsown right, complete with brand name.Thatisdesigned to take the wind out ofthesailsofanyone who mightseek, paradoxi-cally, to contrastthe perfection ofa syn-theticproductwith the inherentﬂaws ofanatural one in a wayadvantageousto thelatter, ashashappened to syntheticgem-qualitydiamonds.The chosen name will be revealed onOctober1stata fashion showin the Muse-um ofModern Art, in NewYork—aswill aT-shirt, the ﬁrstgarmentto be made fromthe material.

Bank, presidentof theBlue JeansCorporation, predicted thatthere would be a man on Marsbefore theproduction ofapparel wasautomated. Al-mosthalfa centurylater, he hasnot yetbeen proved wrong. Viewed through thelensofhistory, thisisastonishing. Spinningwasone ofthe ﬁrstprocessesto succumbto industrialisation. Weavingfollowedshortlyafterwards. Cuttingthe resultantcloth into piecesfrom which an item isthen assembled iseasynowthatpatternscan be reduced to software. But, though ef-fective sewingmachineshave beenaround since the 1840s, theiractivities stillhave to be guided byhand. The idea of put-tinga boltoffabricinto one end of an auto-mated production line and gettingcom-pleted garmentsoutofthe otherthusremainsasimpossible asitwasin Bank’sday. Two American companies, however,thinkthattheyhave cracked the problem,and thata system which can turn cloth intoclothingwithoutthe need fortailors isjustaround the corner.One ofthese aspiringﬁrms, SoftWearAutomation in Atlanta, Georgia, alreadymakesmachines, Sewbots, thatcan turnouttowels, pillows, rugs, matsand othersuch essentiallyrectangulargoods. Soft-Wear’sboss, PalaniswamyRajan, thinksSewbotsare almostreadyto take theplunge with actual garments—in particu-lar, with T-shirts. The otheraspirant,Sewbo, which isbased in Seattle, has madeaT-shirtalready, asa proofofprinciple,though itdoesnotyethave a commercialproduction system.The problem both ﬁrmsare trying toovercome isthatcloth isﬂoppyand be-havesunpredictablywhen pushedaround. Itisthushard to align two piecesofitin a waythatallowsthem to be sewntogetheraccurately. The putative solutionsthe ﬁrmshave come up with are, though,completelydiﬀerentfrom one another.SoftWearAutomation’sapproach hasbeen to improve itssewingrobots’ abilityto handle cloth—in essence, to make thoserobotsmore like human tailors. Sewbo’shasbeen to make cloth itselfeasierfor ro-botsto handle.SoftWear’sSewbotsrelyon two things:high-speed, high-resolution camerasableto monitorthe movementofindividualthreadsin a piece ofcloth, and softwarethattakesthose movementsand general-isesthem to describe the distortion andorientation ofthe fabricwhich the threadsin question are partof. Thatpermits a Sew-botto adjustthe fabricappropriately asit isfed to the machine’sneedles. Thisfeedingisdone bya vacuum-powered roboticgrip,which can be programmed to workwith avarietyoffabricsizes.Sewbo’sapproach isto simplifythefeedingprocessbystiﬀeningthe fabric.Thisisdone bycoatingitwith a thin layerofa plasticcalled polyvinyl alcohol beforeitgetsanywhere nearthe needles. Fromthen on, accordingto Jonathan Zornow,Sewbo’sfounder, itcan be handled assheetsofmetal mightbe in a carplant.Aligningsuch sheetsso thattheycan besewn togetheriseasy. And, once a garmentiscompleted, the plasticcan be removedbysoakingin warm water. Thisisa routineprocedure, forpolyvinyl alcohol isalreadyused elsewhere in textile production tostrengthen yarn duringweaving.Thatboth MrRajan and MrZornowhave theireyeson the T-shirtmarketisnocoincidence. T-shirtsare structurallysim-ple and demand forthem ishuge. Both ofthese thingsmake them ideal forautomat-ed massproduction.

Both thedemand and the rarityare, however, large-lyartiﬁcial. Diamondswere made desir-able in the 20th centurymainlybya mar-ketingcampaign from De Beers, a bigSouth African producerofthe stones. Thescarcitywas, until recently, a result ofthesame company—which atone pointcon-trolled about90% ofthe world’sproduc-tion—ensuringthatthe numberofstoneswhich found theirwayinto the world’sjewelleryshopswaswell regulated. In nature, though, diamondsare unre-markable. Theyare simplycrystalsof car-bon, albeitcrystalsofa type thatneeds afairamountofpressure to form. And car-bon isthe fourth-mostabundantelementin the universe. Forthatreason, diamondsare thoughtto be the commonestgem-stoneson Earth. Elsewhere in the cosmos,asdemonstrated in a paperjustpublishedin Nature Astronomy, theyare probablyavailable in embarrassingabundance.DominikKraus, a physicistatthe Helm-holtzCentre in Dresden, and hiscol-leagues, are interested in ice-giantplanets,such asUranus(pictured) and Neptune.Unlike gasgiants(Jupiterand Saturn beinglocal examples), which are made mostly ofhydrogen and helium, ice giantsare rich incomparativelyheavyelementssuch asoxygen, nitrogen and, crucially, carbon.Thatcarbon islocked up in compounds,mostlyhydrocarbonssuch asmethane,ethane and the like. Ice giants, asthe name suggests, are alsobig. Thismeansthat, in the depthsof theirthickatmospheres, temperaturesare highenough to splitthose hydrocarbonsintohydrogen and carbon, and pressuresaresuﬃcientto compressthe carbon into dia-monds. The consequence, 10,000km orsobeneath the top ofthe atmosphere, is aconstantrain ofdiamonds. Those dia-mondssinktowardsthe planet’score, en-crustingitin a thicklayerofgem stones.That, atleast, isthe prediction. Testingitistricky. Previousattempts, usinganvils tocompresshydrocarbonsand lasersto heatthem, have hinted thattheorymay, with afewtweaks, match reality. ButDrKraus’spaperisdeﬁnitive. He and hiscolleaguesputtinysamplesofpolystyrene—which,like methane, ismade ofcarbon and hy-drogen—in frontofa giantX-raylaserat theNational AcceleratorLaboratory, nearStanford Universityin California, in orderto squeeze and heatitatthe same time. The resultsconﬁrmed whatresearchershad longsuspected. Diamondsdo indeedform in such conditions, although the pres-sure required isa bithigherthan previous-lythought. And DrKraus’sresearch will beofinterestto more than justgem-cutters ofthe distantfuture lookingfornewsourcesofsupply. Knowingthe temperature andpressure atwhich partsofan ice giant’sat-mosphere startto decompose into their el-ementaryconstituentscan help astrono-mersﬁxthe relationship between theradiusand massofsuch planets. That isuseful, forthese daysscientistsare interest-ed in planetsoutside the solarsystem aswell asthose within it. Forsuch bodies,massand radiusare often the onlydataavailable.

Theywere run byin-siderswho milked them forexcessproﬁts.Theygained advantage bybribingpoliti-ciansaswell asproducingnewproducts. The march ofcapitalism lefta great dealofdestruction in itswake. The settlers mas-sacred both the Native Americansand thebuﬀalo thathad made theirhomeson thegreatAmerican plains. The robberbaronsbuilttheirfactoriesand railwayswithoutregard to the qualityofthe airorworkers’safety: in justone year, 1893, 1,567 railwayworkerswere killed and 18,877 injured.The“creative” side ofcreative destruction didnotnecessarilycompensate: Americanswho were born duringthe gilded age wereshorterand had a brieferlifespan thanthose born halfa centuryearlier. The second theme isthe conﬂictbe-tween America’sconception ofitselfas aland ofequal and self-reliantcitizens andthe realityofpost-civil-warAmerica. TheNorth tookup armsagainstthe South in or-derto universalise the ideal ofa republicbased on free labour. Itpassed a successionofmeasuressuch asfree land forsettlers(provided theyworked the soil forﬁveyears) and publicsupportforeducation inorderto give the ideal ﬂesh. Butrealitypulled in a diﬀerentdirection. The Confed-eracyall butre-enslaved the blacksin theiron cage ofJim Crowand prejudice. Giantorganisationscrushed small independentworkshops. Some ofthe bestpassagesinthisbooklookathowAmericansstruggledwith the contradictionsbetween whattheybelieved aboutthe world and whatstared them in the face. The third theme isthe uniﬁcation ofthecountry, asAmericansgave up sayingtheUnited States“are” and began to saytheUnited States“is”. The countrybecameboth biggerand smaller. Biggerbecause populism and progressivism, and wildpendulum swingsofpolitical fortunes. Richard White iswell qualiﬁed to coverthistumultuousera. Asthe authorof a ﬁnebookon America’srailways(“Railroaded:The Transcontinentalsand the MakingofModern America”), he knowsasmuch asanybodyaboutthe mostimportanttech-nologyofthe era. Asa professoratStan-ford University, he can see the era from theperspective ofthe westcoastaswell astheeast. Three greatthemesrun through thissprawlingnarrative, which movesbackand forth between politics, economics andpolitical thought. The ﬁrstisthatcapitalism wasnever astriumphantin thisera asitsapostles claim.Contemporariessuch asIda Tarbell did agood job ofdemonisingJohn D.

In the ﬁrsthalfofthe 19th centurytheﬂowofAmerican trade wasnorth-to-south via the coastsand riversystems. Inthe second halfofthe 19th century, thanksto the arrival ofthe railways, itwas increas-inglyfrom eastto west. Attimes, MrWhite isso keen on expos-ingthe destructive side ofcapitalism thathe downplaysthe creative side. Duringthisperiod America replaced Britain as theworld’smostimportanteconomy. Greatcompaniesseized on newtechnologiesand innovative managementtechniquesto reduce the price ofbasiccommodities,sometimesbyasmuch as90%, asin thecase ofsteel and oil. And millionsof people, manyofwhom came from Europein boats, were given the chance ofachiev-ingthe republican dream ofa house oftheirown. “The RepublicforWhich ItStands”should be read alongside more positive ac-countssuch asRobertGordon’s“The Riseand Fall ofAmerican Growth”, which ar-guesthatproductivitygainsin thisperiodlaid the foundation ofAmerica’smassprosperity. Butmostofall MrWhite’sbookshould be read—notjustbecause ithas somuch to sayaboutthe latterpartofthe 19thcentury, butalso because itcastslight onAmerica’scurrentproblemswith giantcompaniesand roilingpopulism.7THE woesofinternational-relationstheoristsdo notusuallyelicitpublicsympathy. But“The Virtual Weapon andInternational Order”, LucasKello’slucidand insightful bookon the politicsof cy-berspace, doesa good job ofpersuadingthe readerofthe near-vacuum thatprevailsin academicworkon the threatsto peo-ple’scomputersand networks.Newtechnologies, he argues, have up-ended conventional understandingofthewaystatesdeal with defence and deter-rence. The threatispervasive; a cyber-attackcan hitanythingfrom a missile-control system to a media website, withpotentiallyprofound consequences. Geog-raphyisirrelevant. Old thinkingabout de-fendinga perimetermakesno sense whenthe adversaryisprobablyalreadylurkingin yournetworks. The simplertechniquesmaybe used byall mannerofadversaries:criminalsand hooligansaswell asspiesand soldiers. These categoriesmayover-lap. Attributingan attackismore diﬃcult.The shiftismuch biggerthan from pastchangesin militarycapability—the authorhighlightsthe use ofsubmarines, poweredﬂight, tanks, radarornuclearweapons.Some academiccolleaguesstill maintainthatnothingnewhasreallyhappened;technological change doesnotfundamen-tallyalterthe understandingofwarfare. MrKello lambastssuch scepticson both prac-tical and theoretical grounds.Hiscase studiesinclude the crude butcripplingattackon Estonia’sinformationsystemsin 2007, which wasprobablyaRussian response to the movingofa Soviet-era warmemorial. He also looks atthe hackofSonyPictures, probablybyNorth Korea in response to the release of“The Interview”, a satirical ﬁlm about thecountry’sleader, and the American-IsraeliStuxnetsoftware-driven sabotage ofIran’snuclearcentrifuges.Such state-sponsored attacksstop shortoffull-scale war, butare too aggressive tocountasnormal peacetime behaviour. Anotherriddle fortheoristsisthatattacksstraddle the civilian-militarydivide. MrKello, an American-educated Argentine-Estonian who nowworksatOxford University, coinsthe term “unpeace” to describe the ambiguous, persistentirri-tantsand stuntsofrecentyears. He alsooutlinesan interestingnotion of“punctu-ated deterrence” asa wayofrespondingtosuch attacks. The meansemployed wouldinclude militaryand non-militarymeans,with unpredictable timing. Such a pros-pect, he argues, would deterattacksmorecrediblythan the threatofall-out“kinetic”(real-world) war. He isvague on the details:aseriousbookon cyber-deterrence wouldbe welcomed bymany.Although he isnothimselfa computerscientist, MrKello displaysan enviablegrasp ofthe technical issues, aswell asofthe academiclandscape. One ofhistargetsiscomplacency. Anotherisoverspecialisa-tion: lawyers, militarytheorists, politicalscientistsand technogeekseach see onlytheirown side ofthe problem. Aco-opera-tive, all-round approach would mean abetterframeworkforunderstandingthe interaction between individualsand statesin cyberspace.Academicjoustingisa spectatorsportformostoutsiders, butthe dangersfacingourcomputersand networksare not.

One waythattribes, from teensto programmers, signalmembership ofthe group is through lan-guage. Hacksdo the same. Theywrite“hed” for headline, “lede” or“intro” forthe ﬁrstsentence in a story, “graf” for“paragraph”, “nutgraf” for the core para-graph thatgivesthe story’s main idea.The lastline isalwaysthe “kicker”. Butjournalistsshould notbe obscure.Afterall, the whole pointofthe job istomake thingsclearto readers. Yetreadersare often baﬄed bythe ﬁrstwordstheysee in a newspaper: headlines. In Britain,abroad range ofnational newspaperscompete on nearlyeverynews-stand. Sothe tabloids, in particular, puta premiumon gettingasmanyshort, emotion-grab-bingwordsin the biggestfontpossible onfrontpage—often atthe expense ofmak-ingsense. Arecentheadline in the Sun,Britain’sbestsellingtabloid, declaring“LOVE ISLE SEX DRUG SHOCK” did notcarryanyinformation aboutwho didwhatto whom; note the lackofa verb. Butitdid include justaboutasmanyjolts tothe British id asare possible in ﬁve words.RupertMurdoch, the Sun’sowner, isoftenconsidered the fatherofthe modern tab-loid, so itisno surprise thathis NewYorktabloid, the Post, copiesthisstyle. Possiblythe mostNewYorkheadline everwas“MOB COP SEX FURY”. Even where headline-writersare moresober, asin the broadsheets, theytry to getasmanycontent-rich wordsin astheycan. Keepingthe fontbigmeansomittingmanyofthose little function words: “the”,“a”, “and”, prepositionsand the like. Butthese words, despite theirsmall size, havean outsize importance: theyconveythewho-did-what-to-whom ofthe contentwordsbyprovidingstructure and context.Omittingtoo manyofthem givesrise toheadlineslike “ServicesForMan Who Re-fused To Hate ThursdayIn Atlanta”, raisingthe question ofwho exactlydoeshateThursdayin Atlanta, or“PatrickStewartSurprisesFan With Life-ThreateningIll-ness”, which would seem a prettycruelthingforMrStewartto do, ifread with acertain tiltofthe head. In the main text, journaliststend to theopposite sin. Instead ofbeingobscure, theymake prose feel so drearilyfamiliarthatthe readerwondersifthe papercame outlastmonth—oreven lastyear. Asatiricalpiece in the Washington Postcovered thewhite-nationalistmarchesin Virginia asthough written bya hackforeign corre-spondent, describing“tribal politics” and“ﬂashpoints” in which the “Trump regime”sided with the “ethnicmajority”. Goodeditorshave a listofclichésthatthey strikefrom theirpageswith zeal. Onlya journal-istﬁnds“fresh” a fresh synonym for“new”,so thatthe readerhearsof“fresh clashes”or“fresh elections”, orin one grislyexam-ple, “fresh bodies” washingup weeksaftera tsunami. Onlyin the papers dotime periods“see” thisorthat: March sawmajordemonstrations, April sawfreshclashes, and so on. Overused wordslike landmark, histor-ic, crisis, watershed, make-or-break andthe like give the impression thatthe writ-erdoesnottrustthe factsthemselves toconveyanydrama. The inexperiencedwritermayﬁnd these clichésand over-used wordsrushingto the ﬁngertips. Itistemptingto write like manyofthe jour-nalistsyouhave read, to showthat youhave mastered the wayitisusually done.Whereasthismightworkon a lazy edi-tor, itisno road to distinction. George Or-well once wrote: “Neveruse a metaphor,simile orotherﬁgure ofspeech which youare used to seeingin print.” Where mostwritersﬁnd themselvestalkingaboutpeople rushingto something“like mothsto a ﬂame”, Orwell had them doingso“like bluebottlesto a dead cat”. Thoughknown bestasa novelistand essayist, hewasalso a masterchroniclerofthe thingshe sawasa journalist. Orwell’sconcern wasnotjuststylistic.Itwasthathackneyed writingbetraysrushed, automaticthinking, ratherthanslowand critical reﬂection. Ofcourse, itishard to be reﬂective when workingto adeadline. Everynewspaper, includingthisone, will feature some verbiage thatisthe equivalentofthe ubiquitousﬂat-packIkea furniture, chosen notbecause it in-spires, butbecause itisquickto assembleand getsthe job done. Yetcrafting freshlanguage, forall the time and eﬀort ittakes, isthe ﬁrststep in producing storiesthatwill notonlybe published, but beread with pleasure.

Harvill Secker; 352 pages;£16.99IN1956 an airstrip wasbuilton Montser-rat. Forthe ﬁrsttime itwaseasy to ﬂytoand from the Caribbean island; within ﬁveyears30% ofitsinhabitantshad emigratedto Britain. Similarexodusestookplaceacrossthe world: by1961nearlya sixth ofthose born in the RepublicofIreland livedin Britain. Like a quarterofthe populationon Earth, the Montserratiansand Irishlived in a British colonyorformercolony.Underthe British NationalityActof1948,imperial subjectsand Commonwealthcitizenswere entitled to the same rights asanyone born in Britain.Thisproved to be short-lived. The Com-monwealth “open door”, the subjectofClairWills’spoignantbook, “LoversandStrangers”, lasted onlyuntil 1968. MsWills,aPrinceton professor, hasproduced a se-riesofthematic“miniatures” depicting“the fragmentaryexperiencesofmetropol-itan migrantlife”. Thisisthe source of thebook’sstrengthsand weaknesses: itis arich accountthatdoesnotalwayscohere inasatisfyingway.The economicappeal ofmigration wasobvious. In Mirpur, the region thatmanyPakistani immigrantscame from, the aver-age weeklywage fora labourerin the early1960swaslessthan 40 pence; in Britain itwas£31($39.70). In the 1940sand 1950smostofthose who arrived planned to stayashorttime to make the mostofopportu-nities; theyconsidered themselvesmi-grants, notimmigrantswho had settled forgood. Migration “needed to be made topaybackhome”, MsWillswrites, and thiswasachieved bysendingremittances.Immigrantsstayed connected to homein otherways, too. Manyheld on to the tiesand prejudicesofthe placestheycamefrom. Irish pubsin Birmingham were seg-regated alonggeographical lines—onemightbe frequented byDubliners, anotherbyimmigrantsfrom western Ireland.Home wasrecreated, too, with musicandpoetry—such asTrinidadian calypso orPunjabi boliyan—even asnewlyricsde-scribed life in Britain with itsLyons CornerHousesand welfare state.Forall the joysofthe migrants’ experi-ence, asdepicted in these songs, whatstandsoutin “Loversand Strangers” arethe diﬃcultiestheyfaced. Thiswas per-hapsmostacute forimmigrantsfrom theCaribbean. Educated in schoolsmodelledon the British system, theyexpected awarm welcome from the “mothercoun-try”; yetwhen theyarrived theystruggledto ﬁnd landlordswillingto rentthemhomes. MostCommonwealth citizensfound themselvesregarded asthe “strang-ers” ofthe book’stitle. Violence towardsWestIndianseruptedwith the NottingHill riotsin 1958. Itwas,MsWillswrites, a “watershed”, markingthe startofan era in which immigration be-came more openlycontentious. In the elec-tion of1964 the WestMidlandsseatofSmethwickwaswon byPeterGriﬃths, aConservative who called forimmigrationto be halted forﬁve years. Againstthisbackdrop, the Commonwealth Immi-grantsActsof1962 and 1968 were passed,ﬁrstlimitingentryto those with workvouchers, then to those with a parent orgrandparentwho wasa British citizen.Thislegislation sparked a rush to “beatthe ban”. In the 18 monthsbefore the 1962actcame into force, 98,000 immigrantsar-rived from the Caribbean alone. More sig-niﬁcant, itushered in a newphase of immi-gration. Manymen broughtovertheirfamilies, fearingitwould soon become im-possible to do so: between 1962 and 1965,more than 90% ofCommonwealth immi-grantswere the dependentsofmen livingin the country. Afterreunion with one’sfamily, itwaseasierto imagine oneselfan immigrantratherthan a migrant, to feel settled forthelonghaul. Still, asthe authorwrites, immi-grantslived in a limbo, “belongingsecure-ly” neitherto Britain norto theirhome-land. Butno matterhowremote thathomeland mightfeel, itcould still exert apowerful pull. “IfI dream tonight,” one Jamaican immigrantsaid in 1966, “youcanbetyourlife itwill be aboutJamaica.”7Post-war British immigrationIn search ofthemotherlandLovers and Strangers: An ImmigrantHistory of Post-War Britain.By Clair Wills.Allen Lane; 442 pages; £2571The Economist August26th2017MIRAS - The ICD Islamic Finance Talent Development ProgramThe Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD), member of the Islamic Development Bank Group is mandated to support the economic development of its member countries through the development of the Private Sector.

With only a fewﬁrms still to report, second-quarterearnings for S&P500 companies areexpected to be 12% higher than a yearago. Of the ﬁrms that report revenue bycountry, 40% of sales come from abroad;these have been buoyed by improvingglobal growth and a weak dollar. Proﬁts inthe energy industry are thought to haveboomed by a staggering 534% to $7.9bn,after low oil prices caused misery in 2016.The tech sector has done well, with Face-book’s and Apple’s earnings exceedingexpectations. Proﬁts of “consumer dis-cretionary” ﬁrms have barely risen,owing to Amazon’s weaker-than-expect-ed earnings.74The EconomistAugust26th2017LETme tell youa little story. (Itwon’ttakelong, and bythe time youwake up it’llbe over.) It’sabouta fellowcalled Bruce.Skinnylittle runt, notmuch ofa looker: fartoo much chin and notenough hair,though it’swonderful whata good toupeeand a comb-overwill do. No matinée idol,more like yourembarrassingUncle Fred,who neverquite decided whetherhewanted thatmoustache. The sortofchapgirlstake pityon, butnotenough pity on, ifyoutake mymeaning. Anyway, nevermind all that. He wasa lovelydancer. Youcan alwaystell a dancerbyhiswalk: feetturned out.No, dear, I don’tmean sissy, though I dare-sayyoumight. And he dreamed ofmakingalivingtappingthe boards, makingthatfantasticnoise. Butbeingprudent, and lov-inghismum and dad who had scrapedand saved to give him dance lessons, healso trained asa teleprinter-operator whenhe wasin the RAF, justso he had a propertrade to go to. Which wasjustaswell, since for a long,longwhile Bruce’sbestshowbizmomentwasbottom ofthe bill atthe Theatre Royalin Bilston. Thatputprecisely13 shillingsand fourpence in hispocket. Poorlad! yousigh. So deserving. And so modestthatwhen he did a turn, orseveral, atthe Wind-mill in Soho, amongbeviesofbeautieswearingnothingbuta bunch ofgrapes(who’sa luckyboy, then?), he never oncelosthiscool. Well, onlyonce, and then hemarried her. So shyand retiringthat whenhe wasrescued from SummerSeason atEastbourne Hippodrome forhisBigTVBreakon “SundayNightatthe London Pal-ladium” (in 1958, forpeanuts, on a two-weekcontract), he wasso worried aboutover-exposure on the tellythathe bookedhimselfforSummerSeason atAlmostAnywhere Else-on-Sea. And then alongcame “Brucie” to takeBritain bystorm! Shimmyingacrossthescreen with those bigteeth, thattirelesscheesypatterand those niftyfeet(over-ex-posure washismiddle name!). Histhreebigshows—foranyone outthere who’sbeen locked in a deep freeze for50 years—were “Palladium” in the 60s, “The Genera-tion Game” in the 70sand 90sand “StrictlyCome Dancing” in the noughties, and theywere alwaysthe biggestthingon telly, top-pingthe ratingsassmoothlyashe dancedthe nightaway. From 13 shillingsand four-pence fora whole run to £1,000 a week,1962 money! Brucie’sshowbizcareerlastedso long, 75 years, thatitgotinto GuinnessWorld Records. Howheartsraced (orstom-achsturned) when histenortonessoaredoverthe creditsfor“The GenerationGame” ashe posed in silhouette, back bentand ﬁstraised to brow: notso much Ro-din’s“Thinker” as“Game ShowHostasHuman Questionmark”!Li-ife isthe name ofthe gameAnd I wanna playthe game with you.Brucie wasloud. He started everyshow hecould with hisbestLondon-costermon-ger’sroar, “Nice to see you...” so the fanswould all roarback, “To see younice!” Andhe wasrude. Myword could he be rude, asthe poorcontestantstried to dance ﬂamen-co ordo magictricksormake a poton awheel, all againstthe clockofcourse.“You’ve made a real messofthat, haven’tyou?” “Do youwanna play, ornot?” “Oh,do shutup dear, I’m tryingto geton withthe show!” Buthowthe audience loved it,with all the knowingwinksand jaw-dropsin theirdirection, and the trulydreadfulprizesofmicrowavesand glitterballs and ayear’sworth ofsocks! Theylapped itup. Asforthe girls, he onlyhad to say“Give usatwirl!” and theyfell into hisopen arms. Heheld a record there too—don’tbe cheeky!—forbeddingtwo MissWorlds, one ofwhom wasso gorgeouslycurved thatshebecame MrsBrucie numberthree. Howaboutthat, then?Rolling backthe carpetNow, modestBruce found loud Brucie dif-ﬁcult. In fact, he couldn’tstand him. All hewanted wasto do the besthe could; thatname-in-lightsstuﬀwasnonsense. Yet Bru-cie had been there from the start, of course.Whyelse did little eight-year-old Bruce be-come so obsessed with Fred Astaire that hedanced until hisfeetached, rollingback thelounge carpetto tap acrossthe lino? Whoelse nudged him to become “BoyBruce,the MightyAtom” atthe tenderage of14,and gave him the courage to tell church-hall pianists, “No dear, no, it’sgotto be fast-er”? Who else pushed him to be a completeprofessional in all the thingshe did, evenplinkingthe ukulele? Who else moanedand moaned when hisTV showswere puton at5.40, after“DoctorWho”, ratherthanin prime time? And tookiteven worsewhen the dud game shows(yes, there wereafew) were axed? And who else butBrucie wasthe ﬁnalstarburstofthe varietyshow, all-singing,all-dancing, all awful jokes? Hisenergycould ﬁll anytheatre, especiallyhis favour-ite, the wonderful Palladium, all marbleand brassand plush. Butkind, gentleman-lyBruce broughtthe warmth ofthe oldstyle, which showed through even whenvain Brucie wasbeingtetchyand tart: a reallove ofplayingto a live familyaudience. Tobe honest, “Strictly”, played to camera,wasn’thalfso much fun. Butthere couldn’tbe a betterwayto bowout, with a“Keeeeep dancing!” and a sail acrosstheﬂoor, while the whole world ofentertain-mentcried: “Didn’the do well?”7Ladies and gentlemen...SirBruce Forsyth, starofvariety, died on August18th, aged 89ObituaryBruce ForsythEspressoSUBSCRIBERS ENJOY:Yet to subscribe?
