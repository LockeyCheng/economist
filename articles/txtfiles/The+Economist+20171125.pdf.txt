Butoneattractsparticularvenom.Inheritance taxisroutinely seenasthe leastfairbyBritons andAmericans. Thishostilityspansincome brackets. Indeed, sur-veyssuggestthatopposition toinheritance and estate taxes(one levied on heirsand the otheron legacies) iseven strongeramongthe poorthan the rich.Politiciansknowa vote-winnerwhen theysee one. The es-tate ofa dead adultAmerican is95% lesslikelyto face tax nowthan in the 1960s. And Republicanswantto go all the way: theHouse ofRepresentativeshaspassed a tax-reform plan thatwould completelyabolish “death taxes” by2025. Fora time be-fore the second world war, Britonswere more likelyto paydeath dutiesthan income tax; todaylessthan 5% ofestatescatch the taxman’seye. ItisnotjustAnglo-Saxons. Revenuefrom these taxesin OECD countries, asa share oftotal govern-mentrevenue, hasfallen sharplysince the 1960s(see page 20).Manyothercountrieshave gone down the same path. In 2004even the egalitarian Swedesdecided thattheirinheritance taxshould be abolished. Yetthistrend towardstriﬂingorzero estate taxes oughttogive pause. Such leviespittwo vital liberal principles againsteach other. One isthatgovernmentsshould leave people todispose oftheirwealth astheysee ﬁt. The otheris thata per-manent, hereditaryelite makesa societyunhealthyand un-fair. Howto choose between them?When the heirs loomSome people argue fora punitive inheritance tax. They startwith the negative argumentthatdead people no longer enjoythe general freedom to disburse theirwealth astheywish—asthe dead have no rights. Howcould they, when theyare notaf-fected one wayorthe otherbywhathappensin the world?Thatdoesnotringtrue. The logicwould be to abrogate eventhe mostmodestofwills. Butinheritancesare deeply personaland the biggestsingle giftthatmanygive to causesthey believein and loved onestheymayhave cherished. Many(living) peo-ple would feel wronged iftheycould notprovide fortheir chil-dren. Ifanything, asthe expression oftheirlastwishes, be-questscarrymore weightthan theirpassingfanciesdo.The positive argumentforsteep inheritance taxesis thattheypromote fairnessand equality. Heirshave rarely doneanythingto deserve the moneythatcomestheirway. Liberals,from John StuartMill to Theodore Roosevelt, thoughtthatneeded correcting. Roosevelt, who warned thatletting hugefortunespassacrossgenerationswas“ofgreatand genuinedetrimentto the communityatlarge”, would doubtlessbeaghastatthe situation today. Annual ﬂowsofinheritance inFrance have tripled asa proportion ofGDPsince the 1950s.HalfofEurope’sbillionaireshave inherited theirwealth, andtheirnumberseemsto be rising. However, in 2017, itisnotclearexactlyhowdecisive a roleinheritance playsin the entrenchmentofthe hereditary elite.Data from Britain suggestthatpeople tend notto lose theirpar-entsbefore theyreach the age of50. In rich countriesthe ad-vantagesthatwealthyparentspassto theiroﬀspring beginwith the sortingmechanism ofmarriage, in which elites in-creasinglypairup with elites(see leaderon page 16). Theycon-tinue with the beneﬁtsofeducation, social capital and lavishgifts, notin the deedsto the ancestral pile.Even ifthe linkbetween inheritance-taxratesand inequali-tywere clear, wealth can payfora good taxlawyer. In the cen-turysince Roosevelt, Sweden and otherhigh-taxersdiscoveredthatifgovernmentsimpose a steep enough duty, the rich willﬁnd waysto avoid it. The truststheycreate asa result can lasteven longerthan the three generationsittakesforfamily for-tunesto go from clogsto clogs.Armed with such arguments, some leap to the otherex-treme, proposing, asthe American taxreform does, that thereshould be no inheritance taxatall. Notonlyisitright to letpeo-ple hand theirprivate propertyto theirchildren, they say, butalso bequestsare often the fruitsoflabourthathas alreadybeen taxed. And a large inheritance-taxbill isdestructive, be-cause itcan cause the dismembermentoffamilyﬁrmsandfarms, and force the sale ofancestral homes.Yeteverytaxisan intrusion bythe state. Ifavoiding doubletaxation were a requirementofgood policy, then governmentswould need to abolish salestaxes, which are paid out oftaxedincome. The risksthatheirswill be forced to sell homes andﬁrmscan be mitigated byallowingthem to paythe duties grad-ually, from cashﬂowratherthan byﬁre-sales.In fact, people who are againsttaxin general ought to belesshostile to inheritance taxesthan othersorts. However dis-liked theyare, theyare some ofthe leastdistorting. Unlike in-come taxes, theydo notdestroythe incentive to work—where-asresearch suggeststhata single person who inherits anamountabove $150,000 isfourtimesmore likelyto leave thelabourforce than one who inheritslessthan $25,000. Unlikecapital-gainstaxes, heavierestate taxesdo notseem to dis-suade savingorinvestment. Unlike salestaxes, theyare pro-gressive. To the extentthata higherinheritance tax can fundcutsto all othertaxes, the system can be more eﬃcient.TransfermarketThe rightapproach isto strike a balance between the two ex-tremes. The precise rate will varyfrom countryto country. Butthree design principlesstand out. First, targetthe wealthy; thatmeanstaxinginheritorsratherthan estatesand setting ameaningful exemption threshold. Second, keep itsimple.Close loopholesforthose who are caughtin the netby setting aﬂatrate and bygivingpeople a lifetime allowance for be-quests; setthe rate high enough to raise signiﬁcant sums, butnotso high thatitattractsmassive avoidance. Third, with theﬁscal headroom generated byhigherinheritance tax, reduceothertaxes, lighteningthe load formostpeople. Asensible discussion ishard when inheritance taxespromptsuch a visceral reaction. Buttheirerosion has attractedtoo little debate. Afairand eﬃcienttaxsystem would seektoinclude inheritance taxes, noteliminate them. 7The case fortaxingdeathHowto balance people’s desire to bequeath assets with the unfairness ofinheritanceLeaders14LeadersThe EconomistNovember25th20171WHYisAmerica’sDepart-mentofJustice (DoJ) try-ingto blocka mergerbetweenAT&T, a telecomsgiant, andTime Warner, a media conglom-erate? Simple, saysome: Presi-dentDonald Trump hasitin forCNN, which isowned byTimeWarner. Itmattersto the independence ofAmerica’strustbust-erswhetherMrTrump’stasteshave steered the DoJ. Buthehappensto be rightwhen he saysthatthe deal is“notgood forthe country”. The real problem isnotthe DoJ’smove, butthecontradictionsin hisadministration’scompetition policies. Adayafterthe DoJﬁled itscomplaint, the Federal Commu-nicationsCommission (FCC) announced plansto repeal ruleswhich protect“networkneutrality”, the principle thatinter-net-service providers(ISPs) musttreatall sortsofdigital traﬃcequally. Thatwould enable AT&Tand othersto charge moreforcertain typesofcontent, so longastheyare open aboutit. AsetofpoliciesthatsimultaneouslythwartsAT&Tfrom bulkingup and givesitmuch greaterlicence to raise prices, and doesboth in the name ofcompetition, isincoherent. Noton theirwatchThe marriage ofAT&Tand Time Warnerwould be a “vertical”merger, meaningthattwo ﬁrmsfrom diﬀerentbitsof the sup-plychain are combining. The deal would bringtogether anownerofthe infrastructure thatdistributescontent(ﬁxed, sat-ellite and mobile connections) and a ﬁrm thatcreates it. Trust-bustershave notlooked too closelyatvertical deals—andAmerica’scourtshave been tolerantofthem. The content busi-nessisalso beingdisrupted byAmazon and Netﬂix. That iswhyRupertMurdoch istempted to throwin the towel by sell-ingoﬀbitsof21stCenturyFox(see page 57). AT&T and TimeWarnerargue theyare justlegacyﬁrmstryingto adapt. Time Warnerownssportsrightsand manychannels, someofwhich reach nearlyall the 100m American householdsthatsubscribe to pay-TV. The DoJworriesthatthe combined ﬁrmcould exploitthisunfairlyto win newdistribution customers.Itthinksitcould jackup the feesitchargesothervideo distrib-utors, such ascable and wirelessproviders; iftheybalk, sub-scribersmightdecamp to itsown oﬀerings. Thisispossible.And there isanotherworry, particularlyasmore people con-sume contentseamlesslyovermobile devicesaswell as TVsand computers: thatAT&T strong-armsitswireless, satelliteand wireline customersto buymore Time Warnercontent. Avertical mergerisdangerouswhen one ofthe partiesis so pow-erful. One in two Americansare wireline, satellite or wirelesscustomersofAT&T, which extractsa fatreturn on capital of17%(excludinggoodwill). Acombined ﬁrm would be America’seighth-largestbyrevenue, with huge lobbyingpower.An AT&T-Time Warnertie-up would be even more worry-ingin lightofthe FCC’splans. AjitPai, the commission’snew-ish chairman, thinksthatstrictrulesenforcingnetwork neu-tralityare notneeded. Instead, he wantsISPsto settheirownpoliciesand getanotheragency, the Federal Trade Commis-sion, to enforce them case bycase. Thatmightworkin coun-trieswith ﬁerce competition amongﬁxed broadband provid-ers; in America, where millionsofhouseholdshave only onechoice ofhigh-speed supplier, itwould surelyfail. Big ISPscancharge startupsand othersmore forbandwidth, slowing inno-vation and leavingconsumerswith lesschoice.America needsto getcompetition policyright. Concentra-tion hasrisen acrossmostofitsindustriesoverthe pasttwo de-cades. Giantssuch asFacebookand Google raise profoundquestionsfortrustbusters(see page 61).

Thechancellortried to negotiate a three-waycoalition of herCDU/CSU, the revived pro-businessFree Democrats(FDP) and theGreens. Though thiswould have had manyadvantages, bar-gainingwith both leftand rightwasalwaysgoingto be tricky,and the talksbroke down on November19th, when the FDPwalked out(see page 45).

Higheconomics, lowpoliticsand badjokescombine in an hour-longmonologue before a bayingcrowd. Philip Hammond, whopresented hisbudgeton November22nd, had itharderthanmost. The deﬁcitstill yawns, votersare sickofausterity and,amid a Conservative civil war, manyofMrHammond’sownside wantrid ofhim. Impressively, he stuckto mineral water.Itwasa decentspeech, focusingon the dire productivityproblem thatisholdingBritain back(see page 51). Itshould beenough to save hisjob, which isjustaswell, since he isone ofthe fewremainingsensiblesin Theresa May’scabinet. ButMrHammond’sbudgetwasa bleakreﬂection ofthe state Britain isin. Economic-growth forecastsare sharplyworse. Money isshort. And, although manyofthe chancellor’spoliciespoint inthe rightdirection, theirtimid scale spoke ofa government tooweakto live up to itsambitions.Watered down and on the rocksAsMrHammond intended, the immediate coverage highlight-ed a modesttaxbreakforﬁrst-time housebuyers. But the realstoryofthe budgetwasthe forecastsforBritain’sfuturegrowth. The independentﬁscal watchdogexpectsthe econ-omyto growby1.5% thisyear, down from the 2% itpredicted inMarch. By2020 growth will be aslowas1.3%. Thisisata timewhen forecastsformostrich countries—including, notably, theeuro zone—are beingrevised upwards. And thisgloomypic-ture mayeven be optimistic. The forecastsare based on the as-sumption thatBritain will continue to enjoyhigh levels ofim-migration and remain in the single market, neitherof which islikely. And theymake no provision forthe possibility ofa da-magingno-deal Brexit, which the governmentstill throwsaround asa plausible outcome ofitstalksin Brussels.MrHammond barelydared to mention Brexit, focusing in-stead on the shortagesofhousingand skilled workers, whichhe correctlyidentiﬁed ascentral causesofBritain’sproductivi-typroblem. Butto slaythese monsters, he brandished a pea-shooter. Schoolswill getan extra £600 ($800) a yearforeachpupil who studiesadvanced-level maths.

The needlesslyharsh treatmentofpeople applyingforuniversal credit, a welfare beneﬁt, willbe softened somewhat. Butthe cutsto the incomesofthe verypoorestwill notbe anylessdeep. The National Health Service Britain’s budgetWinteris comingPublic-sector net borrowingBritain, % of GDPF’CASTFinancial years beginning April50510+–200005101522Philip Hammond’s cautious budgetstruckthe rightnotes, butwas a grim reﬂection ofBritain’s predicamentand deadlock—thatisfamiliarto othercountries, but nottopost-warGermany. The protracted uncertaintythatisnowlikelywill be bad forMrsMerkel, forGermanyand for Europe. MrsMerkel facesthree options, none ofthem palatable. Theﬁrstisto form a minoritygovernmenteitherwith the FDP, orwith the Greens(or, justpossibly, alone). Germany’sconstitu-tion (and consensual traditions) would give such a govern-mentsome protection from no-conﬁdence votes. Yet, thoughothercountrieshave minoritygovernments, modern Ger-manyhasno federal experience ofthem. MrsMerkel herselfbatted awaythe idea thatsuch a beastcould give Germany thestable governmentitneeds. The FDPleader, Christian Lindner,sayshe isnotinterested either. Aminoritygovernment ishigh-lyimprobable—unlessa deal with the GreensgivesMrs Merkelthe option ofrelyingon case-by-case supportfrom the SPD. More likely, therefore, isthe option ofrevivingthe GroKowith the SPD. Ithasgoverned Germanyprettywell since 2013.The SPD supportsstrengtheningthe euro zone, forinstance bygivingmore powersto itsEuropean StabilityMechanism, so agrand coalition could workcloselywith MrMacron.Although thismaybe MrsMerkel’spreferred option, ittoohasproblems. The SPD’sleader, Martin Schulz, hasruled theGroKo out, though he isnowunderpressure from some in hisparty, includingGermany’spresident, to change hismind. Be-ingin governmentwith MrsMerkel hurtthe SPD, pushingitsshare ofthe vote down to itslowest-everlevel. The party needsastintin opposition to revive itself. Mostofall, a GroKo mightbe seen byGermansasreheatingthe stale dish thatthey reject-ed, addingyetagain to the appeal ofthe political extremes.Thatleavesa newelection, the option MrsMerkel shouldpursue. True, there are risks. Avote cannothappen soon: Ger-many’sconstitution, mindful ofthe 20 governmentsand nineelectionsin the 14 Weimaryears, deliberatelymakesithard tocall one early. Add the time needed formore coalition-build-ing, and Germany—and the EU—could be withouta newgov-ernmentin Berlin until MayorJune. There isno guarantee thatthe result, in the messyseven-partypolitical environment oftoday’sGermany, will be anymore clear-cutthan the last. Vote, vote, voteAn election would, however, oﬀerthe advantage ofallowingdebate overimportantissues, such asthe future ofthe Euro-pean project, thatthe partiesavoided in the previous cam-paign. Rich and stable, Germanyneed notfearrepeated elec-tions. Butnone ofthislooksgood forMrsMerkel. She saysshewould run again ifthere were anothervote, and she is unlikelyto face a leadership challenge justnow. Buta poorelection re-sult, followed bythe failure ofthe coalition talks, hasgiven heran airofprecariousness. Whateveroption she chooses, she isaboutto enterthe ﬁnal actofherpolitical career.716LeadersThe EconomistNovember25th20172wasgiven justenough moneyto help itlimp on (atthe sametime, the chancellorallocated £3bn forBrexitpreparations,which mightsurprise people who voted Leave hopingthat itwould free up more cash forthe NHS).

IfBritain isto prosper, itwill need to make harderchoicesthan this. 7MARRIAGE idealisesperma-nence, and yetitischang-ingmore rapidlythan atanytime in itshistory. Almost every-where itisbecomingfreer, moreequal and more satisfying. Asourspecial reportthisweek ex-plains, wedlockhasbecome sogood thatitiscausingtrouble. The mostbenign changesare takingplace in poorand mid-dle-income countries(where mostpeople live). Child mar-riage, once rife, isebbing. So iscousin marriage, with itsatten-dantriskofgeneticdefects, though itisstill fairly common inthe Middle Eastand partsofAsia. Relationsbetween hus-bandsand wiveshave become more equal (though notequalenough). Aswomen earn more and the stigma ofdivorcefades, more men are ﬁndingthattheycannottreattheir wivesasservants(or, worse, punchbags), because women can cred-iblythreaten to walkaway. In some regionschange hasbeen astoundinglyquick. In In-diathe share ofwomen marryingbythe age of18 hasdroppedfrom 47% to 27% in a single decade. “Love marriages” remaindisreputable in India, and arranged marriagesthe norm. But,asin manytraditional societies, youngpeople have more say.Some can veto the matestheirfamiliessuggest; others choosetheirown, subjectto a parental veto. Acrossthe world, popularculture israisingexpectationsofwhata good marriage islike,and datingwebsitesare givingsingletonsvastlymore options. Ring the changesThe worryingpartiswhatisgoingon in rich countries. In theWestmarriage isin excellentshape, butonlyamongthe well-oﬀ. Elite couplesdelaytyingthe knotto allowtime to getestab-lished in a career, buttheystill tie itbefore having children.Working-classpeople, bycontrast, are dramaticallyless likelyto puta ringbefore a cradle than in previousgenerations.Amongthe college-educated in America, only12% ofbirthsareto unmarried mothers; amongthose who dropped outofhighschool, the rate is70%, up from 43% in the early1980s. Similartrendscan be seen acrossthe wealthyworld: the average out-of-wedlockbirth rate forOECDcountriesis40%. Ifmarriage were justa piece ofpaperthiswould not matter.However, itismuch more than that. Although a wedding can-notturn a ﬂimsyrelationship into a strongone, itadds scaﬀold-ingthatcan save one thatisin between. Makinga public, life-longcommitmentto anotherperson isnotthe same asdriftinginto cohabitation to share the rent. And thismatters a lotifchil-dren are involved. One studyin America found that18% ofmarried couplesbroke up within ﬁve yearsofa birth, com-pared with 47% ofcohabitingcouples. Children from stable backgroundstend to do betterinschool and life—and are more likelyto form stable unions oftheirown. Add the trend towards“assortative mating”, whenhigh-achieversmarryotherhigh-achievers, and the gap be-tween elite and working-classfamiliesyawns. Aﬄuent par-entsintensivelynurture theirchildren forsuccess; the oﬀ-springoflessfortunate homesfall farbehind before theyeversetfootin a school. The marriage gap makesrich countriesmore unequal, and retardssocial mobility. Improbable asitmayseem, thispattern islikelyto reach ev-erycornerofthe globe. The forcesthathave shaken up mar-riage in rich countries—risingindividualism, education, wom-en’seconomicemancipation—are spreading. Itisnotjust aWestern trend. Fora longtime Japan resisted it: highly educat-ed women were lesslikelyto marrythan others. Nowthey aremore likelyto (and lesslikelyto divorce).The revolution in familylife islargelybeneﬁcial, and thereisnotmuch thatgovernmentscan do aboutitsharmful side-eﬀects. America hastried hard to promote wedlockamongpoorpeople since the 1990s, butfailed utterly. Countriesshould tryto ensure thattheirwelfare systemsdo not penalisemarriage amongthe poor. Theyshould not, however, lurch inthe otherdirection byprovidingtaxbeneﬁtsto the married.Given the growingsocial stratiﬁcation ofmarriage, such mea-suresare exceedinglyregressive. Working-classWesternershave notgiven up on marriage.On the contrary, manyidealise it. Ratherthan seeing itasthestartofa couple’sjourneytogether, asin the past, they oftensee itassomethingnotto tryuntil theyarrive—with a good job,ahouse, ﬁnancial stabilityand a lavish party. Many feel theyare not“ready” to marry, even astheyembarkon parenthood.Helpfully, some European countrieshave begun to oﬀer civilunionsforheterosexuals. (Gaycouplesalreadyhad that op-tion.) Theyconfernearlyall the rightsofmarriage but entaillessofthe intimidatinghoopla. These nowaccountfor a ﬁfthofnewformal unionsin the Netherlands, and more in someworking-classdistricts.

In the pasttwo yearsbud-geted revenuesfrom inheritance taxin Ja-pan have risen bya ﬁfth to some $20bn ayear, around 0.5% ofGDP. Thistrend ofswellingreceiptsmarks Ja-pan out. Revenue raised through taxes oninherited wealth wasonce a bigcontribu-torto governments’ coﬀers. Ithassinceshrunksigniﬁcantly. In OECD countriestheproportion oftotal governmentrevenuesraised bysuch taxeshasfallen bythree-ﬁfthssince the 1960s, from over1% to lessthan 0.5%. Overthe same period Australia,Canada, Russia, India and Norwayareamongcountriesthathave abolisheddeath duties. More than 20 Americanstatesbinned wealth-transfertaxesbe-tween 1976 and 2000; in 2010 the federalestate taxwasabolished fora single year.The ﬁnal reckoningPresidentDonald Trump wantsAmerica toeliminate itforgood. “No familywill haveto paythe death tax,” he said asa presiden-tial candidate. “It’sa double tax; it’sa taxondeath,” accordingto Steven Mnuchin, thetreasurysecretary. IfHouse Republicansgettheirwayon reform proposalscur-rentlymakingtheirwaythrough Congress,the tax-free exemption on the estate tax—currently$5.49m—would double, followedbyfull elimination in 2025 (see page 31). Asinheritance taxeshave lightened,some people have gained enormously. In1976 roughly8% ofAmerican estatesﬁled ataxable return; thathassince fallen toaround 0.2%. Butnoteveryone beneﬁtsfrom cuttinginheritance taxes. Indeed, thewideradvantagesofreducingsuch taxeshave been overestimated. And the costsare evident. Inheritance taxislevied on the peoplewho getthe moneyaftersomeone dies, es-tate taxon the moneyitself. Theyare someofthe world’soldesttaxes. In 6ADthe vice-sima hereditatiumor“20th ofinheritance”wasimposed byAugustus, the ﬁrstRomanemperor. An inheritance taxofsortswasintroduced in Britain in 1694. Around thesame time French peasantswere requiredto cough uplodsetventes, a version ofaninheritance tax, to theirlords.Classical liberal thinkersseem to favourtaxinginheritances. Adam Smith said that“a powerto dispose ofestatesforever ismanifestlyabsurd.” Political philosopherswere guided byargumentsappealingtofairness. Mere accidentofbirth, the think-ingwent, did notamountto entitlement toacquire wealth. JeremyBentham rejectedthe notion thatdescendantshad an abso-lute right, based in natural law, to the prop-ertyofrelations: “who isthissame Queen,‘Nature,’ who makessuch stuﬀunderthename oflaws?” he sniﬀed. John StuartMillwanted to encourage equalityofopportu-nity, ratherthan the creation ofan elite thatwould endure forgenerations. He also be-lieved thattaxingthe rich, who often livedoﬀinherited propertiesand landed estates,would permitlowertaxeson the poor, al-lowingthem to save more. Reformersturned the early20th cen-turyinto the golden age oftaxinginheri-tances(see chart1on nextpage). In 1906Theodore Rooseveltdemanded thatCon-gresspassa graduated inheritance tax.America introduced itsestate taxin 1916, Death ofthe death taxSTOCKHOLM AND TOKYOInheritance taxes have fallen outoffavouraround the worldBrieﬁngTaxing inheritancesThe Economist November25th2017BrieﬁngTaxinginheritances2112and bythe 1940sthe top rate was77%. InFrance until 1956 everysingle bequestwassubjectto a tax. Until the second world warBritonswere lesslikelyto payincome taxwhile livingthan to have theirestate taxedaftertheirdeaths. However, in subsequentdecadesananti-taxmovementgathered steamaround the world. The price ofhousing inrich countriesbegan to rise in the 1970saspopulation growth ran up againstrestric-tive planningpolicies. Ashome-owner-ship increased and a higherproportion ofhouseholdsaccumulated wealth, inheri-tance taxwasseen asmore ofa burden.Meanwhile, asforeign-exchange controlswere dismantled, politiciansfeared thathigh taxeson wealth would promptrichfolkto up sticksand move elsewhere. Dead hand ofthe stateIn theirbook“Death bya Thousand Cuts”,on the politicsofthe American estate tax,Michael Graetzand Ian Shapiro describethe emergingconsensusthattaxinginher-ited wealth wasunfairand unwise. Butmuch asadvisersin the administrations ofRonald Reagan and George H.W. Bushwanted to abolish estate tax, theybelieveddoingso waspoliticallyimpossible. In 1992 somethinghappened whichchanged the termsofthe debate. TwoDemocraticcongressmen proposed reduc-ingthe tax-free exemption from $600,000to $200,000, therebyincreasingthe num-berofpeople subjectto the tax. They didnotforesee the unpopularityofthe pro-posal, which washurriedlywithdrawn—butnotbefore, accordingto MessrsGraetzand Shapiro, “conservativesbecame alertto the possibilitythattheymighthavemissed something.” Ahighlyeﬀective political campaignagainstthe estate taxfollowed. Adherentsinsisted thatthe estate taxwasunfair sinceitamounted to double taxation. After all,bequestsare often ﬁnanced from earningsthathave alreadybeen subjectto incometax. Theyalso devised a devastatingnick-name—the “death tax”. Advocatesofthe taxwere unable tocounterwith anythingnearlyaspowerful.Afewpointed outthatdouble taxation oc-curson a dailybasisin the form ofsalestaxes(people buythingswith taxed in-come), orthatitiswhatthe person leavesbehind, ratherthan the person, which issubjectto the estate tax. Callingit a “wind-fall tax”, asBentham mighthave, couldhave helped, butonlyso much.  Characterssuch asChesterThigpen, anAfrican-American tree farmerin his80s,were crucial to the campaign. In 1995 Thig-pen, a descendantofslaves, settled into thewitnesschairin frontofthe House Waysand MeansCommittee. He had come fromMississippi to Washington, DC, to talkaboutthe damage the estate taxwould in-ﬂicton hisfamily. On hisfarm were “beau-tiful forestsand pondsthatcan live on formany, manyyearsaftermywife and I passon,” he said. Yetwhen he died “mychil-dren mighthave to breakup the tree farmorsell oﬀtimberto paythe estate taxes.” Thigpen’stestimonycame to symbol-ise the idea ofgovernmentoverreach. Jen-niferDunn, a Republican, referred to theThigpen example asshe argued in theHouse ofRepresentativesthatthe tax sys-tem should “reward savings, investmentand hard work”. In 1998 the jointeconomiccommittee, a congressional panel, usedThigpen’sfarm asan example of“the bur-densome nature ofthe estate tax” to argueforitsrepeal.Ordinarypeople were receptive tothese arguments, perhapsbecause Ameri-cansare an optimisticbunch. According toMessrsGraetzand Shapiro, surveysat thetime suggested thataround 40% believedthattheywere in the top 1% ofthe wealthyorwould be there “soon”, makingthemfearful ofa heftytax. The prospectof re-peal waspopular, even ifin realitymost ofthe beneﬁtswould go to the richest. Asthe pressure built, politicians even-tuallyhad to act. Before the presidentialelection in 2000 George W. Bush pro-claimed thathe wanted to be “rid ofthedeath tax”, which he sawassomething“thattaxespeople twice” and “penalisesthe familyfarmer”. An actpassed in 2001made bigreductionsto the estate tax, cul-minatingin the one-yearrepeal in 2010.Even in itscurrentdiminished form, how-ever, itisstill hated. Overhalfof Ameri-cansagree with the idea ofeliminating it;MrTrump found on the campaign trail thathispromise to abolish itwasjustas popu-larasithad been forMrBush. MessrsGraetzand Shapiro implythatthe circumstanceswhich led to the declineofthe estate taxwere peculiarlyAmerican.In an alreadyhighlyunequal society, thisinterpretation goes, rich people hijackedthe political system and shaped taxpolicyto theirown ends. Yetcountriesquite un-like America have also seen bigcutstowealth-transfertaxes.Sweden, which isusuallyseen asegali-tarian, hasgone one step further. In 2004itsinheritance taxwasrepealed, with thesupportofa formercommunistparty,amongothers. Whatprompted such a rad-ical transformation from the 1960s, whenthe largestestatescould face an eﬀectivetaxrate of60%? Bythe end ofthe 1970sthere wasa growingsense thatthe Swed-ish state wasbloated; a turning-point camewhen Astrid Lindgren, the creatorofPippiLongstockingand a national hero, revealedthatshe faced marginal taxratesofmorethan 100%. Aﬁnancial crisisin the early1990sreinforced the sense thatthe countryneeded to become more competitive.Politiciansnoted the special disgustthatSwedesreserved forinheritance tax.Accordingto Swedish Enterprise, a lobbygroup, entrepreneurssuch asIngvarKam-prad, the founderofIKEA, were leavingthecountryto avoid high taxes. Storiesabounded offamilyﬁrmsbroken up to paythe bill. Atﬁrst, tweakswere introduced tothe Swedish system. Yetthe resulting com-plexitymetwith disapproval. Sweden is asmall countrywith high levelsofsocialtrust; people are allergicto bureaucracy,saysJanerikLarsson ofTimbro, a think-tank. “Itwaseasierto getrid ofitentire-ly.” Afterabolition MrKamprad returnedto Sweden. The economyhasgrown quick-lyin recentyears, and anti-taxadvocatesclaim theyhave been vindicated.HeirconditioningItisclearthatantipathyto inheritance tax-esiswidelyshared amongpoliticians andtheirelectorates. Yetthe economicbeneﬁtsofcuttingsuch wealth-transfertaxes mayhave been overplayed and the drawbacksunderappreciated. Startwith migration. Arash Nekoei ofthe Institute forInternational EconomicStudiesin Stockholm issceptical that abol-ishinginheritance taxreallydid encouragemanyentrepreneursto move backto Swe-den. Although migration from Swedenhappened to rise in the second halfof the2000s, afterthe taxwasabolished, otherfactorswere clearlyinvolved.

So iftheyare allowed to passon more, theymaytryto accumulate more, beneﬁtingnotonlytheirfamilybutthe economy asawhole. Asan additional beneﬁt, ifwealth-transfertaxesare cut, people need notwaste time on taxplanning. Again, there isnotmuch evidence tosupportthese propositions. Akira Kawa-moto, an investorwho used to workat Ja-pan’seconomyministry, dismissestheidea thatincreasesto the country’sinheri-tance taxhave undermined enterprise.“No one atthe startoftheircareeris think-ingaboutsuch a tax,” he says. Indeed, it isnoteworthythatmanyofthe world’srich-estself-made people, such asWarren Buf-fettand Bill Gates, advocate wealth-trans-fertaxes. The academicevidence isalso reveal-ing. Ifall bequestswere intentional youmightexpectpeople with children to bemore enterprisingand to save more thanthose without. Butthisisnotsupported bythe data. Youmightalso expecta child’searningsto have a bigeﬀecton the size ofabequestleftbya parent. Apoorchild, afterall, isin greaterneed ofmoneythan a richone. Observationsfrom Sweden andAmerica, however, ﬁnd onlyweakevi-dence thata child’searningsaﬀecta par-ent’splansfora bequest.Thatsuggeststhata large proportion ofinheritancesare “accidental”. People saveto insure againstpersonal risks, rather thanto passon wealth when theydie. (Ben-tham mulled a 100% taxon the estatesofpeople dyingwithouta will, reasoningthatthe entire bequestcould be consideredaccidental.) Research also suggeststhatsome bequestsare “egoistic”, meaningthataparentderiveshappinessfrom the pre-taxamountbequeathed, ratherthan whatachild will receive afterthe taxis applied.Cuttingwealth-transfertaxeswouldsurelyreduce the need forwealthyfolk toengage in tax-planning, freeingthem up formore productive activities. Butthere arefewestimatesofhowmuch time and mon-eythisactivityactuallytakesup. A studypublished in 1999 suggeststhatthe overallcostofestate-taxcompliance is7% ofes-tate-taxrevenues. Yeta chunkofthosecosts, such asselectingexecutorsand draft-ingdocuments, would still be paid even inthe absence ofthe tax. So itishardly clearthatthe rich would be leftwith much extratime formore productive undertakings. The third justiﬁcation forcutting orabolishinginheritance taxes—thatitwillpreventthe break-up offamilyﬁrms—is inmanycountriesthe mostpoliticallyimpor-tantone. The Thigpen storyisone of manytold byanti-taxcampaigners. Sweden maynowhave the world’smostgeneroustaxsystem forfamilyﬁrms. Even Japan oﬀersthem exemptionsfrom inheritance tax.Butisitsensible forthe state to privilegefamilyﬁrms? There issomethingreassur-ingaboutenteringa shop thathashadthree generationsofthe same familybe-hind the till. Descendantsmayuse an in-heritance to expand the familyﬁrm, poten-tiallycreatingmore jobsalongthe way. FamilytiesYetkeepingthingsin the familyhascosts.Byexcludingfamilyﬁrmsfrom inheritancetax, and therefore stoppingsome frombreakingup, meansboostingtheirnum-bers. ApaperbyFrancisco Pérez-Gonzálezofthe Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo deMéxico ﬁndsthat“nepotism hurts[ﬁrm]performance bylimitingthe scope ofla-bour-marketcompetition”. Firmsthatpro-mote familyCEOssee declinesof14% inoperatingreturn on assets, a measure ofproﬁtability. Research byNickBloom ofStanford Universityand othersﬁndsthatfamilyﬁrmsare the worst-managed of anytype. Poormanagementofﬁrmsisone ofthe main reasonswhyproductivitygrowth in rich countrieshasbeen so de-pressed in recentyears.The problemsassociated with family-run ﬁrmspointto anotherrisk: that peoplewith inheritancesworklesshard ordropoutofthe workforce altogether. In an es-sayin 1891AndrewCarnegie, an industrial-istborn in Scotland, argued thatthe “par-entwho leaveshisson enormouswealthgenerallydeadensthe talentsand energiesofthe son, and temptshim to lead a lessuseful and lessworthylife.” Research sug-geststhatlotterywinnersworkless. Andaccordingto a paperpublished byDouglasHoltz-Eakin, formerlyofthe CongressionalBudgetOﬃce, and two colleagues, Carne-gie wasright. Aperson cominginto an in-heritance above $150,000 isfourtimesmore likelyto leave the labourforce thansomeone who inheritslessthan $25,000. Such ineﬃcienciesare setto deepen aspayoutsincrease. Afterpeakingin the 19thcentury, the stockofwealth in rich coun-triestumbled duringthe ﬁrsthalfof the20th. Thatwasin partthe resultoftwoworld wars, which destroyed factories andshranksavingsthrough high inﬂation. Yetaccordingto workbyThomasPikettyofthe ParisSchool ofEconomics, in recent de-cadesthe growth in the stockofwealth inadvanced economieshasoutpaced in-come growth. The data are patchy. Yetitappears that,aswealth hasbounced back, the size of in-heritanceshas, too (see chart2). The annu-al ﬂowofinheritancesin France has tripledfrom lessthan 5% ofnational income in the1950sto about15%, notall thatfarfrom the19th-centurypeakof25%. Research sug-geststhatthough inheritancescan reduceshort-run wealth inequalitybygiving awindfall to poorhouseholds, the long-runeﬀectisto increase it. Thisisin part becausericherfolktend to save theirwindfall, incontrastto poorerfolk, who spend it. Ifthe importance ofinheritance contin-uesto grow, and MrPiketty’scalculationssuggestthatitwill, some worrythat itcould foreshadowthe return ofan inheri-tance societyin which marriage endsupbeinga surerroute to richesthan starting acompanyorworkinghard. The incomesat-tained bythe top 1% ofFrench inheritorsare alreadyhigherthan those attained bythe top 1% ofworkers. AcrossNorth Ameri-ca, Europe and EastAsia, the numberof bil-lionaireswho have inherited theirwealthseemsto be rising, accordingto researchfrom the Peterson Institute forInternation-al Economics, a think-tank.Such considerationssuggestthattheshiftawayfrom wealth-transfertaxesoughtto be the subjectofmore public de-bate. Instead, itlookssetto continue inexo-rably.

Jackfruittreescan be planted alongside coconutpalms, the main local crop, and a hectare ofthem can bringin $12,000 a year, saysJoeBacusmo ofVisayasState University. Leyte liesamongthe islandsofthe East-ern Visayas, one ofthe mostdeprived partsofthe Philippines. About30% ofthe peoplein the region are poor, accordingto the gov-ernment; in the countryasa whole theshare isaround 17%. Thisrepresentspro-gressofa sort. Overthe pastthree decadesextreme povertyhasmore than halved inthe Philippinesbythe World Bank’smea-sure. Butseveral nearbycountries, such asVietnam, China and Thailand, have man-aged almostto eradicate the scourge in afarshortertime (see chart). One problem islowgrowth: between1980 and 2005 the average annual increasein GDP wasjust0.63%, a patheticpace byregional standards. More recentlya leap inremittancesfrom the millionsofFilipinoswho workabroad and a boom in the out-sourcingofback-oﬃce workto the countrythird ofFilipinossurvive through farmingorﬁshing, industriesin which productivityhaslagged badly. Unfairsystemsoflandownership leftoverfrom colonial timesare largelyto blame. Powerful familieshave kepthuge estatesthrough theirpoliti-cal inﬂuence; the familyofformerpresi-dentsCorazon and Benigno Aquino isacase in point. Feeble land reform began inthe late 1980sand isstill underway(re-formsin Taiwan, South Korea and Vietnamwere farfasterand more resolute). It hascreated prolonged uncertaintyoverthe sta-tusofland, discouraginginvestment.Much-needed irrigation systemsare notwidespread, forexample.Poorpartsofthe Philippinestend tohave higherbirth rates, asin mostcoun-tries.

MrDuterte re-centlysigned an executive orderto speedimplementation ofa lawpassed ﬁve yearsago to make contraception more easilyavailable to the poor, despite determinedopposition from the Catholicchurch. Inthe pastweekthe country’sFood and DrugAdministration wasﬁnallyable to lift atwo-year-old judicial ban on 51female hor-monal contraceptives, havingconvincedthe courtsthattheywould notinduceabortions, which are mostlyillegal.MrDuterte’sgovernment, in a comfort-able position ﬁscally, isalso spendingmore.

Infrastructure isan importantfocus. byWestern ﬁrmshave boosted growth.ForecastssuggestthatGDPwill expand byover6% thisyear, asitdid lastyear.Butthe growth isconcentrated in Ma-nila and the two neighbouringprovinces,which generate around 60% ofthe coun-try’soutput.

Thesepublicworksare critical to boosting thefortunesofthe poorerbitsofthe country,byconnectingthem betterto Manila. Both the governmentand foreign aidagenciesare beginningto focuson foodprocessing. Thatisa good wayto increasefarm incomesquickly, saysRichard Bolt ofthe Asian DevelopmentBank. Around In-opacan, local authoritiesare investing infryingequipmentforboth jackfruitand ba-nanas, in the hope ofnurturinga fruity-snackindustry. Packetsofcrunchyfriedjackfruitare much more easilytransportedthan the fresh sort(which can weigh asmuch as50kg). Salustiano Piamonte, afarmer, sayssellinghisfresh jackfruit in thelocal marketcan earn 35 pesosa kilogram,whereassellingitto the processorsbringsin only16 pesosa kilogram. “Butatleasttheprice isguaranteed,” he says. And the fruitgetscollected from him despite the muddy,unpaved road thatleadsto hisfarm. In addition to jackfruit-planting, pig-fat-teningand tilapia-farmingschemesare un-derwayin Leyte.

Butfatalism isnotthe only rea-son forthe Himalayan republic’spalpablelackofexcitementon the eve ofwhatoughtto be a historicelection. The vote, tobe held in two stageson November26thand December7th, isforboth a newna-tional legislature and newstate govern-ments, undera crisp newconstitution. Itfollowsnearlythree decadesofwhatC.K.Lal, an acerbiccolumnist, describesas “his-toryon steroids”, duringwhich Nepal’s29m people endured a ten-yeararmed in-surgencythatleftsome 18,000 dead, amachine-gun rampage byan angryprincewho slaughtered nearlythe entire royalfamily, a revolvingdoorofgovernmentsunder25 diﬀerentprime ministers, includ-ingspellsofarch-conservative dictatorshipand ofrule byMaoistguerrillas, the aboli-tion ofthe 240-year-old monarchy, a mas-sivelydestructive earthquake, devastatingﬂoodsand a ruinouseconomicblockade. The vote lookssetto produce a stronggovernment, which underthe newrules islikelierto lastfora full ﬁve-year term. Theemergence oftwo dominantalliances, oneon the rightand one on the left, could au-gurthe formation ofa stable two-party sys-tem. The national vote comeson the heelsofthe ﬁrstsuccessful local elections in 20years. Turnoutforthatvote, which con-cluded in September, wasclose to 75%.Women and marginalised groupsare wellrepresented on the 753 newcouncils. Thesehave extensive powers, in deference tolong-standingdemandsfrom variouseth-nic, linguistic, religious, caste and regionalgroupsformore autonomy. So whythe douratmosphere? One clueliesin the factthatNepal’snewstatesareknown simplyasnumbersone throughseven. Theydo notyethave names, oreven capitals. Theirborders, drawn up justtwo yearsago duringthe hasty, closed-doordraftingofthe constitution, do notmatch obvioustopographical ordemo-graphicdivisions. Instead, saydetractors,the stateswere devised to preserve thedominance ofthe KhasArya, an upper-caste group from the highlandsthatmakesup abouta third ofthe population, butwhich hasforcenturiescontrolled thecountry’sadministration aswell asmuchofitsland and resources, to the growingfrustration oflowlanders, those oflowercaste and ethnicminorities. “There hasbeen no movementin the PEON—the per-manentestablishmentofNepal—for200years,” saysMrLal.Remarkably, given the wide politicalspectrum, from royalistspiningfora returnto monarchy, to revolutionarycommu-nistsdemandinga newpeasantuprising,nearlyall ofNepal’sleadersare indeedfrom KhasArya castes. Since the end of theMaoistinsurgencyten yearsago, the coun-try’stwo main communistpartiesand itslargestconservative partyhave happily al-ternated in power, while happilyalso shar-ingin itsspoils. “I’d call ita neo-feudal orpatrimonial system,” saysa formerﬁnanceminister. “Whatwe have isthe recycling ofthe same old nincompoops.” Adoctorwho goesbythe name ofGo-vinda KC, who hasrepeatedlygone onhungerstrike to protestagainstcorruptionin private medical schoolslinked to politi-cal parties, putsNepal’sdilemma diﬀerent-ly. “We had a monarchy, butnowwe havethousandsoflittle monarchs,” he says.ManyNepalese would agree.

Earlierthisyearthe govern-mentdecided to deploycare workers toaround halfofthe country’s84 prisons.Nonetheless, with so manysilver-haired felonsoﬀthe streets, Japan re-mainsone ofthe safestplacesin theworld.

Theirmain rival,the Nepali Congress, suﬀersthe handicapofhavingbeen more often in power, andso bearinga largershare ofanti-incumbentsentiment. Fewtake the communists’ pur-ported ideologyseriously.

The production of equipment, components and parts for industry is a crucial pillar of commerce and economic growth, and the industry is becoming ever more specialised.As developing countries in Asia strengthen their position in the manufacturing supply chain and increase competition at the low-cost end of the market, leading companies—and economies—must move up to focus on producing equipment for high technology and high-value-added activities.Manufacturers worldwide demand precision, reliability and cost competitiveness from their equipment. Responding to global trends, Malaysia has developed a competitive edge through its skilled and knowledgeable workforce, and its investment 28AsiaThe EconomistNovember25th2017THE barsalongWood Streethave gonequiet.

First,changesto inﬂation indexingand the sun-settingofsome clauseswould hitthe poorin the longterm. Second, and mostimpor-tant, the bill would cutthe corporate andestate (inheritance) taxes.Thiswould continue a long-runningtrend. Both taxeshave been falling—and in-curringmore avoidance—fordecades. In1967 theyraised a combined 4.4% ofGDP;by2016 thishad fallen to 1.7%. Who beneﬁtsfrom lowercorporate taxesisa controver-sial question. The answerissome combi-nation ofinvestors, through higherproﬁts,and workers, through higherwages. Thebestguessisthatabout75% ofthe beneﬁtgoesto rich investors.

Russell Girling, bossofTransCanada,the Canadian operatorofKeystone, said hewas“veryrelieved” to see the $8bn projectﬁnallyapproved. On November20th Ne-braska’sregulatorshad more good newsforMrGirling. The PublicService Commis-sion, an elected panel offourDemocratsand one Republican, approved KeystoneXL crossingNebraska, clearingthe last bighurdle forthe construction ofthe expand-ed pipeline. Yetthe green lightcame with an amberone—the commissionersdid notapprovethe route preferred byTransCanada, butone farthereast. Thiscould add more ex-pense and complexityto a projectthat wascostlyand complicated before iteven start-ed (itinvolvesdozensoflandownerswhohave notyetbeen consulted). Itcould alsopromptyetanotherreviewofKeystone XLin neighbouringSouth Dakota, which hasalreadysaid itwill lookatthe pipelineagain ifchangesmade byotherstates aﬀectthe route through itsplains.TransCanada’sreaction to the regula-tors’ decision wasmuted, atbest. MrGir-lingisnow“assessinghowthe decisionwould impactthe costand schedule of theproject”, he said in a statement. In JulyTransCanada launched an “open season”to solicitbindingcommitmentsfrom ship-persforKeystoneXL. Ithasnotmade the re-sultspublic.“The reviewsofthe regulatorydecisionwere mixed,” saysJim Smith, a Republicansenatorin Nebraska’sunicameral state leg-islature. MrSmith isa longtime supporterofthe pipeline. Asthe ownerofa businesssellingOmaha’sﬁnestgarage doors, hesays, he knowsaboutthe importance ofcheap and plentiful energy. MrSmiththinksrenewable energyistoo costly andunreliable to replace fossil fuels. He pointsoutthatpipelinesare a saferwayto tran-sportoil than rail orlorries. And whentheyleak, operatorscan atleastclean upfairlyquickly. On November16th Keystonespilled 5,000 barrelsofoil in South Dakota,which shutdown the pipeline until at leastNovember23rd. Once all the reviewsare completed, itmaybe economicsratherthan politics thathaltsthe pipeline. “The ﬁnancial viabilityofthe projectishighlyspeculative,” saysTom Sanzillo ofthe Institute ofEnergy Eco-nomicsand Financial Analysis, a researchgroup, who thinksthere isonlya 20-30%chance the pipeline will be built. For Keys-tone XLto workﬁnancially, the price ofoilneedsto be $80-90 a barrel, with an up-ward trajectory, saysMrSanzillo. The priceofoil isat$60 a barrel, compared with $140in 2008 when TransCanada ﬁrstappliedfora permitto pipe oil acrossthe Ameri-can-Canadian border. Lorne Stockman ofOil Change International, an advocacygroup, also thinksthe pipeline isunlikelyto be built. To getgoingTransCanada needsto sign up enough clientswith long-termcontractsfor90% ofthe capacityofKeys-tone XL, which will be able to transport830,000 barrelsofoil a day(comparedwith 600,000 barrelsfrom the currentpipeline). “Shipperswill nothave signedthe dotted line before the Nebraska deci-sion,” saysMrStockman.

Instead ofrelyingon hunches,ora ﬁxed schedule matchingbail amountsto crimesand lawyers’ argumentsto setbail, judgesthere nowuse a nine-factor al-gorithm to assesswhethera defendant isdangerousorlikelyto ﬂee. Those thoughtto be in eithercategorycan be detained;the restare released, butmonitored.DefendersofNewJersey’sexperimentpointto a dramaticdecline in the state’sjailpopulation, driven bya reduction in thenumberofpoor, non-dangerousoﬀenderswho are incarcerated while awaitingtrialforno otherreason than theirinability topaybail. In September2017 NewJersey’sjailsheld 36% fewerpeople than theydid inSeptember2015.

Butreform iscatchingon acrossAmerica. Some ofthechangesare legislative. The California Sen-ate’sPublicSafetyCommittee hasap-proved a bill much like the one thatpassedin NewJersey. The NewOrleansCityCouncil passed a measure banningcashbail formisdemeanours; Connecticuthasalso limited misdemeanourbail. KamalaHarrisand Rand Paul, a Democraticsena-torfrom California and a Republican onefrom Kentuckyrespectively, introduced abill encouragingstatesto move awayfrommoneybail, and to implementpre-trialrisk-assessmentprogrammesbased on evi-dence. In 2016 and 2017 Illinois, Montana,NewMexico and Alaska all passed mea-sureslikelyto reduce the use ofcash bail,and ensure the pre-trial freedom ofmorepoordefendants.Sometimescourtshave led the charge.LastApril a federal judge in Harriscounty,Texas—home to America’sthird-largestjail—found itssystem ofmisdemeanourbail unconstitutional because itdetainedpeople simplybecause oftheirinability topay. (Harriscountyhasappealed.) In Cookcounty, Illinois, a judicial orderdirectingjudgesto limitbail to amountsdefendantscan aﬀord wentinto eﬀectin September;judgesin Arizona, Maryland and else-where have issued similardecrees. Suitsbroughtin variouscitieshave contendedthatcash bail violatesthe 14th Amend-ment’sequal-protection clause, sendingpeople to jail purelybecause theycannotaﬀord bail. The American Civil LibertiesUnion(ACLU) sued Randolph county, Alabama,forinstance, forjailingKandace Edwards,an armyveteran who wasseven monthspregnant, because she could notaﬀord a$7,500 bond afterbeingarrested forforginga$75 cheque. Astudyofthe jail populationin NewJerseybefore bail-reform legisla-tion found that12%—more than 1,500 peo-ple—were locked up solelybecause theycould notaﬀord a bond ofup to $2,500. Ex-trapolatingthatrate nationallymeans thataround 76,000 people are sittingin jail forwantofa fewthousand dollars.Thathaslastingcosts. Astudyby the Ar-nold Foundation, which created the pre-trial assessmentsystem used byNewJer-sey, found thateven briefpre-trial deten-tion forlow- and moderate-riskdefendantscorrespondswith higherreoﬀendingratesforyears. AlexanderShalom, a formerpublicdefenderin Newarkwho nowworksforthe ACLUin NewJersey, said hewould routinelydefend clientsagainstwhom the prosecution had weakcases.Butwhen oﬀered the choice between tak-ingtheircase to trial—and sittingin jail for ayearortwo before then—and pleadingguiltyto time served and justgoinghome,manychose jail. Bail also leadsjudgesto game the sys-tem. State constitutionsoften require bailforpeople arrested on non-capital charges.Butin the name ofpublicsafetyjudges usehigh bail to keep people locked up, with-outgoingthrough the rigorousprocess thatthe Supreme Courtsaysisnecessaryto de-tain people withouttrial. Thishurts poordefendantsbutallowsrich, dangerousonesto buytheirfreedom. Bail reform inNewJerseychanged thisbyintroducing arightto remand anyone arrested who isdeemed dangerous.ButDavid Feige, who with hiswife,Robin Steinberg, founded the BronxFree-dom Fund, a charitythatbailsoutpeoplearrested formisdemeanours, callsthisstandard “a dangerouslyelasticconcept[that] expandseverytime there’sanotherheadline.” The pointofbail, he argues, istogetpeople to return to court; and over a de-cade ofbailingoutthousandsofdefen-dants, lessthan 5% have skipped. Both heand oﬃcialsin NewJerseyhave found thatthe surestwayto getdefendantsto showup isto bombard them with messagesre-mindingthem oftheircourtdate.RasBaraka, Newark’smayor, believesthattoo fewpeople are beingdetained. Hesaysthatthose arrested and released in hiscityhave gone on to commitmore crimes.“People caughtwho’ve done seven, eight,nine burglaries, itdoesn’tmake sense to letthem outso theycan do 11, 12, 13 more,” saysMrBaraka. Yethe still supportsreformsthatmake iteasierforpoorpeople accusedofpettycrimesto go home. Courtsand leg-islaturesaround the countryincreasinglytake the same view.

Thiswasdisin-genuous. The reason manyworryaboutthe FederalistSociety,the legal organisation whose annual bunﬁghtJustice Gorsuchwasaddressing, isnotbecause itisshadowy, butbecause itsinﬂu-ence isvast, brazen and partofa widerpoliticisingof the lastbranch ofAmerican democracyto succumb to partisanship. Hisspeech suggested those worriesare ifanythingunderplayed.Two thingsaboutitwere moststriking. First, the triumphalisttone MrGorsuch, a supposedlyimpartial steward ofthe constitu-tion, struckin celebratingthe legal philosophyand activism ofagroup closelylinked to the Republican Party. “Tonight, I can re-port, a person can be both a committed originalistand a textual-istand be conﬁrmed to the Supreme Court!” he said. “Thankyoufrom the bottom ofmyheartforyoursupportand prayersthrough thatprocess.” Ifthatwasperhapsinappropriate, it wasdeserved. Founded in the early1980s, asa riposte to the legal pro-fession’sliberal mainstream, the FederalistSocietyhashad ahand in the pastthree Republican Supreme Courtappoint-ments—startingwith itsfrostyresponse to George W. Bush’snomination ofHarrietMiersand promotion ofSamuel Alito inherplace. Yetitsrole in MrGorsuch’selevation ismuch greater.Asthe youngestconservative justice, he isthe ﬁrst to havebeen a beneﬁciaryofitsnow-ubiquitouslegal networks through-outhiscareer. Lessideological waysforconservative judges to ad-vance—includingsenatorial favourorworkingforthe RepublicanParty—have meanwhile ﬁzzled. When Donald Trump, in need ofconservative credentialslastyear, demanded a listofpotentialSupreme Courtnominees, itwasnatural he would turn to the“Federalistpeople” fortheirsuggestions, which included Mr Gor-such. Havingridden thatpromise to victory, MrTrump has sincesidelined the American BarAssociation, which traditionally vetsjudicial nominees, and outsourced the processto the society—orratherinsourced it, the White House counsel, Donald McGahn,noted atitsannual shindig, because he isalso a member.The second strikingthingaboutMrGorsuch’sspeech washisboldnessin signallinga legal agenda—curtailingthe federal bu-reaucracy’spowerto interpretstatutes—he meansto pursue. Thisimplied two sortsofdeparture from Antonin Scalia, the original-isthe succeeded. Scalia deferred to both the executive and a tradi-tion wherebyjusticesreveal theirthinkingmore in legal opinionsthan after-dinnerspeeches. MrGorsuch’sremarks—which evenan approvinglegal scholarin the audience considered to be “tip-toeingthe sideline” ofpropriety—augura more activistapproach. The prospectofmore ideological and active conservativejudgesisnotintrinsicallybad. The federal courtslook strongerforincludinga range oflegal philosophies. The problem is thatcon-servativesare notstrivingforbalance, butconquest. That isthelogicofMrGorsuch’sdivisive rhetoric. Itisalso MrMcGahn’splan, encouraged bya presidentwho caresnota whitfor legalphilosophy, butwho hasfound hispromise to appointconserva-tive judgesto be uniquelyeﬀective and achievable.With three liberal ormoderate Supreme Courtjustices, Ste-phen Breyer, Ruth BaderGinsburgand AnthonyKennedy, in orapproachingtheir80s, MrTrump maywell increase the court’sconservative majority. The lowerfederal courtsare even morevulnerable to an ideological makeover. Because Republican sen-atorsrefused to approve manyofBarackObama’snominees, MrTrump inherited manyemptyseatson the benches, which theDemocrats’ decision to scrap the use ofthe ﬁlibusterin judicialappointmentshasmade easyto ﬁll. Hisadministration has so farnominated 59 judges, three timesasmanyasMrObama atthesame pointin histenure, and with almosthalfofthe 150 appellatejudgesofretirementage, itexpectsto nominate manymore.Some ideologuesare still unsatisﬁed; Steven Calabresi, a Federal-istSocietyco-founder, suggestspackingthe federal courts with atleast260 newjudgeships. MrTrump’srecentboastthat, “Therehasneverbeen anythinglike whatwe’ve been able to do togetherwith judges,” could prove to be unusuallyaccurate.Itishard to exaggerate howsigniﬁcant, divisive and funda-mentallyantithetical to the FederalistSociety’soriginal purposethisprojectis. Itrepresentsan assaulton the courts’ already-testedconsensual traditions, which the nextDemocraticadministra-tion would naturallyemulate, therebydividingthe courts evenmore nakedlyalongpartisan linesand makingjudicial appoint-mentseven more politicised than theyalreadyare. The society’sfoundingmission wasto defend the separation ofpowers: itsex-tremism threatensto erode whateveropen ground remains be-tween the judiciaryand elected branches. Bruce Ackerman, a le-gal scholar, predictsthe federal courtsare headingfor a period of“hyper-politicisation” notseen since the 1930s, when FranklinRooseveltwentto warwith the Supreme Courtoveritshostilityto the NewDeal.Ah, Mephistopheles!Thisisnotonlybad forthe courts. The ironyofthe Federalist Soci-ety’spactwith MrTrump isthata movementdedicated to de-fendingthe constitution hasenabled a presidentwhose conﬂictsofinterest, disregard fordue processand disparagement ofinde-pendentagenciesand actors—including“so-called judges”—rep-resenta grave constitutional threat. Conservative lawyers knowthis. Manyhave told Lexington oftheirunease with almosteverythingMrTrump isdoingoutside judicial appointments. Yetinstead ofactingon principle, theykeep raisingthe price oftheirsupport, and MrTrump, who knowsa good deal when he seesone, keepspayingthe bill.7Trumpingthe lawConservative lawyers are among the president’s biggestenablers.

Duringhispresidencyofcongressittamed thepressbythreateningto withdrawtaxex-emptions, to which itisentitled under theconstitution. “Hernándezcould do any-thinghe wantsand nobodywill sayany-thing,” saysHugo Noé Pino, an economist. An exception isMACCIH, an anti-cor-ruption bodyunderthe aegisofthe Orga-nisation ofAmerican States, which MrHernándezinvited in to appease protestersin 2015.

So itis notsurprisingthatLatin Americanshavebeen gripped bythe conﬂictoverCatalo-nia’sfuture. Se rompe España?(IsSpainbreakingup?), asked the coverofSemana,Colombia’sleadingnewsmagazine. FormostLatin Americansitgoeswith-outsayingthatCatalonia ispartof Spain.While the Spanish empire wasatﬁrst aCastilian venture, Catalonia, too, provid-ed viceroysand the forebearsofpresi-dents. In recentdecadesmanyLatinAmerican writershave made Barcelona,with itsliteraryagentsand publishinghouses, a temporaryorpermanenthome.Havinglived in Barcelona for12 yearsun-til 2012, Juan Gabriel Vásquez, one ofCo-lombia’sleadingnovelists, wrote lastmonth in El País, a Spanish newspaper, ofhis“astonishmentand melancholy” atthe drive forCatalan independence.To ensure thattheyremain partof aglobal culture, several writershavemoved recentlyfrom Barcelona to Madrid(aslastmonth did Planeta, the biggestSpanish-language publishinghouse). Butthe astonishmentisalso because separat-ism isunfamiliarin Latin America.Thatstatementneedssome slightqualiﬁcation. Spanish-speakingmain-land America splintered into 15 countriesafterindependence. So thathe couldbuild a canal, Theodore Rooseveltar-ranged to detach Panama from Colombiain 1903. Rio Grande do Sul foughta ten-yearwarto breakawayfrom Brazil beforecomingto termsin 1845. (Paradoxically,Giuseppe Garibaldi, laterthe hero of Ital-ian uniﬁcation, foughtforRio Grande.) In1849 Yucatán soughtto followTexasin se-cedingfrom Mexico and joiningthe Un-ited States, butwasturned down. More recentseparatisteﬀortshave beenlesssigniﬁcant. Commerciallymindedeastern regionsofBolivia ﬂirted with se-cession duringtheirpolitical battle withEvo Morales, the socialistpresident. Thereare occasional mutteringsofseparatism inZulia, in western Venezuela, and in Argen-tine Patagonia. Lastyeara campaign called“the South ismycountry” organised an in-formal referendum on independence inthree southern statesofBrazil (includingRio Grande), in which lessthan 3% oftheelectorate voted. In an echo ofCatalonia,itsorganiserclaimed thatthe region pays“fourtimes” more taxesthan itreceives. Anattemptto stage a repeaton October7ththisyearwasa ﬁasco: only2% turned out.Latin America’slinguisticand ethnic di-visionsdo notlend themselvesto separat-ism. Indigenouspopulations, with theirown languages, are too crushed, dispersedand/ordivided to attemptit. Manyindige-nouspeople would notwantto: in severalcountries, theywantautonomyto pre-serve theirculture butare also battling tobe treated like full citizens.Anotherreason isthat, like France,countriessuch asBrazil and Mexico turnednational unityinto an explicitpoliticalproject. In 1937 Getúlio Vargas, Brazil’sna-tion-buildingpopulist, havingdeclared adictatorship, ordered the ceremonialburningofthe ﬂagsofthe states—includ-ingthe farrapo (rag), asthe ﬂagofhis na-tive Rio Grande do Sul wascalled. Heclaimed to have crushed “the arrogantim-position ofregional interest” which en-dangered national unity. VargasorderedPortuguese to be the sole language ofschool teaching.Somethingsimilarhappened in Mexi-co followingitsrevolution of1910-17. “Weare Indian, blood and soul; the languageand teachingare Spanish,” declared JoséVasconcelos, the education minister inthe 1920sand champion ofmestizaje(ra-cial mixing) asthe essence ofLatin Ameri-ca.

After37 yearsinpower, RobertMugabe resigned on No-vember21st. Long-suﬀeringZimbabweanswentwild. Butasthe partyended, manybegan to askwhetherand howhissucces-sor, Emmerson Mnangagwa, would be anybetter. MrMnangagwa, a formerMugabehenchman notoriousforpersecutingtheopposition and fororganisingthe riggingofelections, returned from a shortexile onNovember22nd, promising“a newdemoc-racy”. “We wantto growoureconomy, wewantpeace, we wantjobs,” he told suppor-tersin Harare, the capital.Hope thatMrMnangagwa will deliveranyofthese restson two pillars. The ﬁrst isthathe plainlyrealisesthatZimbabwe des-peratelyneedseconomichelp fromabroad. The ﬁscal deﬁcit, according to va-riousanalysts, isa whopping12-15% ofGDP. Inﬂation, variouslymeasured, is25-50%. Foreign reservescould run out inmonths. The infrastructure isfalling apart.“Harare isthe pothole capital oftheworld,” grumblesa formerminister.Second, MrMnangagwa seemsto ac-ceptthatin orderto receive help he will notonlyhave to getthe government’sspend-ingundercontrol, butalso enactpoliticalreformsthatculminate in properelections. Scepticsrecall thatmuch the same hopewasexpressed when a unitygovernmentwasformed in 2009 afterthe brutallyrigged election the yearbefore. In thefarthe upheaval hasbeen, in essence, a bat-tle within the rulingparty, Zanu-PF. Bythetime MrMnangagwa returned, dozensofMrMugabe’sallieshad been arrested orhad gone into hiding. These include Igna-tiusChombo, the ﬁnance minister, andGrace Mugabe, the formerpresident’swife,who isholed up in hervastpalace. ManydoubtthatMrMnangagwawould allowa fairelection: ie, one that hemightactuallylose. Underthe constitutionhispresidential term mustconclude at theend ofhispredecessor’sﬁve-yearman-date—byAugustnextyear. Alreadytherehasbeen talkthathe could geta two-thirdsmajorityin both housesofparliament toextend histerm ofoﬃce, perhapsby two orthree years. The main leaderofthe opposi-tion, Morgan Tsvangirai ofthe MovementforDemocraticChange (MDC), hasso farsethisface againstsuch an extension. Butthough itwould be againstthe spirit oftheneworder, Zanu-PFhasthe parliamentarynumbersto enforce it.In anyevent, the opposition ispainfullyweak. EarlierthisweekMrTsvangirai, whowasrobbed ofthe presidencyatthe elec-tionsin 2008, wasbouncingbackto hisoldhale-and-heartyform, rousinga crowd to apitch ofexcitementatMrMugabe’shum-bling. He isclearlystill the main oppositionleader. Buthe isstricken with cancer andlostcredibilityduringhisperiod in co-alition from 2009 to 2013. Hispartyhasbeen rentwith division and hasproducedno natural successor.Moreover, some analyststhinktheMDCwould struggle to win elections,even iftheywere fairand itentered an alli-ance with otheropposition parties. AndMrMnangagwa, who isknown asthe croc-odile forhistacticofwaitingpatiently be-fore attackingruthlessly, maywell chipawayatthe opposition byenticingits moreseniorﬁguresto supporthim. Indeed, ifhe event, MrMugabe failed to enactanyof themajorreformshe had pledged. Thistime, ifMrMnangagwa isto getthe cash and Zim-babwe be forgiven anyofits$9bn in out-standingdebts, he will have to fulﬁl what-everpromiseshe makes. Amongmeasuresurgentlyneeded toreassure potential investorsisa repeal ofMrMugabe’s“indigenisation” lawthatcalled forﬁrmsto be majority-owned byblackZimbabweans. In the pastyearor soMrMnangagwa had hinted he would en-actone. He hasalso discussed coming totermswith the farmers, nearlyall ofthemwhite, who still own legal title to some ofthe more than 4,000 farmsthatwere con-ﬁscated overthe past17 years.Political reform will be even harder.

Foreign governments, especiallyin theWest, are in a quandary.

On the otherhand, theyre-main warythathe could pocketconces-sions, asMrMugabe alwaysdid, whileconsolidatingcontrol overthe countrywith no genuine intention to hold freeelections. Tendai Biti, a formerﬁnance minister,complainsthatthe UNhasyetto send anenvoy. Though the UNDevelopmentPro-gramme hasbeen helpingwith a biomet-ricvoterregister, MrBiti and other mem-bersofthe opposition wantdeeperinternational involvementin the transi-tion, especiallyin the election. “Itisn’tgood enough to outsource itto SADC,” hesaysofthe Southern African DevelopmentCommunity, a regional blocthatin the pasthasrubber-stamped rigged elections. IfMrMnangagwa can steadythe econ-omyand create a newmood ofharmonyduringthe post-Mugabe transition, per-hapshe could win respect, ifnotthe popu-laritythathasso fareluded him.

Butwhen hetalksoftryingto achieve peace between Is-rael and the Palestinians, he often soundslessconﬁdent. Itisa “complexsubject”, the“toughestdeal ofall”, said MrTrump inSeptember. Still, he rateshischances ofsuccessas“very, verygood”.Apeace plan from the administration,expected in September, isnowdue in Janu-ary. MrTrump’sson-in-lawand adviser, Ja-red Kushner(pictured, centre), isleadingthe eﬀort. He isbeinghelped byJasonGreenblatt, the president’senvoyto theMiddle East; David Friedman, the ambas-sadorto Israel; and Dina Powell, a deputynational-securityadviser. The ﬁrstthreeare orthodoxJewswho do notconcealtheirpro-Israel sympathies.Initiallydismissed asneophytes, theteam haswon overscepticswith itswill-ingnessto listen. Even the Palestinians ad-mire theirreadinessto take soundings inrefugee camps, notjustfrom politicians.Theyﬁnd the team more genial than Ba-rackObama’s“pen-pushers”. MrGreen-blatt, the chiefnegotiator, hasopposedunilateral movesbyIsrael and welcomedthe Palestinian reconciliation deal be-tween the nationalistFatah group (whichcontrolsthe WestBank) and Hamas, an Is-lamistgroup (which holdsswayin Gaza).The administration hasbeen tight-lipped aboutthe detailsofitsplan, butthose who have spoken to MrGreenblattdescribe itasmore ofa process—“a roadmap withouta deﬁned road”, saysone Pal-estinian negotiator. The initial stepswillprobablybe little more than conﬁdence-buildingmeasures. The harderproblems,such asdrawingborders, returningrefu-geesand resolvingthe statusofJerusalem,would be leftuntil much later. Itis notevencertain thatthe endgame istwo states,which mostofthe world haslongdemand-ed. Amongthe ideasbeingmooted iseven-tuallyto putJewish settlementsin the WestBankunderPalestinian control. The lack ofclarityisseen asa tacticaimed atkeepingeveryone on board.Whateverthe administration produces,Saudi Arabia islikelyto supportit. MrKushnerhasstruckup a friendship withMuhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crownprince. Though the prince’sforeign-policyrecord isnotwidelyadmired, he seems tohave convinced MrKushnerthathe canhelp reshape the Middle Eastin waysthatsuitAmerica. AtMrTrump’sbehesthesummoned the octogenarian Palestinianleader, Mahmoud Abbas, to Riyadh earlierthismonth and urged him to embrace theAmerican plan. MrAbbasisseen byallsides(includinghisown) asplodding,time-servingand compromised.ForPrince Muhammad, itseems, Pales-tinian aspirationsto statehood are less im-portantthan counteringIran, which hasextended itsinﬂuence in the region. He hassoughta closerrelationship with Israel,which shareshisdarkview. There are re-portsthatthe Jewish state hasshared intel-ligence with Saudi Arabia to help itin itswaragainstthe Iranian-backed Houthi re-belsin Yemen. Prince Muhammad maycalculate thata viable peace processwould give him political coverto make thealliance more overt.OtherArab statesalso have an interestin restartingtalks.

Buthe mightpreferan open-ended processto one withclearmilestonesand deadlinesthatwouldpin him down. He also wantsto showgratitude to MrTrump fornotpushing himashard asMrObama did.The Palestiniansare also loth to alien-ate the Americans. Buttheyfearbeingpushed into a deal thatleavesIsrael in mil-itarycontrol ofthe WestBank. (The Israelishave alreadypushed forHamasto be dis-armed before the talksbegin.) “NeitherNetanyahunorAbbaswantsto insulttheAmerican plan, butneitherhasanyreal in-terestin iteither,” saysJon Alterman oftheCentre forStrategicand International Stud-ies, a think-tankin Washington, DC. In the region, oﬃcialsrate the chancesofsuccessasvery, verylow. “Theywon’tﬁnd a wayto make the circle square afterso manyothershave tried,” saysan Israelidiplomat. “Both sidesare lookingforwaysto sayno to MrTrump,” saysa Palestiniannegotiator.

A looser knot

Marr iage is becoming less hidebound, less dutiful and less
obligator y—but even more important, says Joel Budd

“THIS IS SO exciting!” trills a young woman, squeezing her friend’s arm.
Laid out before her, in the Olympia exhibition centre in west London, is
the National Wedding Show. Some 300 merchants have turned up to sell
everything that is needed to throw a wedding, and a great many things
besides. There are ﬂorists, harpists, teeth-whiteners, tiara-sellers, a ﬁre-
works ﬁrm and more than a dozen photographers. A new company,
Hitch and Pooch, arranges for people’s dogs to play a role in their wed-
dings—as ring-bearers, say. Every
two hours a blast of music an-
nounces a catwalk show consist-
ing entirely of wedding dresses
and grooms’ suits. 
Marriage is often said to be
ailing. It
is “fashionably dis-
missed” and “taken for granted”,
sniﬀed Iain Duncan Smith a few
years ago when he was Britain’s
secretary of state for work and
pensions. Social conservatives ar-
gue that a once-great institution
has been undermined by ever
more blasé attitudes to premari-
tal sex, cohabitation and di-
vorce—and, in the past few years,
by the legalisation of gay mar-
riage. Successive American presi-
dents have poured money into
programmes that aim to promote
marriage among poor people.
In some ways the worriers
are right. For hundreds of years
marriage was an essential step on
the road to full adulthood in
Western countries. In pre-indus-
trial England all single women,
no matter how old, were “maids”, and all single men were “lads”. Preach-
ers argued that marriage was the crucial bond holding together the
household, which was, in turn, the foundation of society.
By the mid-20th century marriage was almost unavoidable. The
idea that people ought to wed and then form a household with a primary
male breadwinner was, in the words of Stephanie Coontz, an American
historian, “like a steamroller that crushed every alternative view”. Peo-
ple tied the knot at ever younger ages: in the 1950s and 1960s the average
American bride was too young to consume alcohol at her own wedding.
Europe was almost as marriage-mad. As late as 1972 fully 87% of French
women aged between 30 and 34 were married.
These days just 43% of French women in their early 30s are married.
That is part of a broad retreat. In Argentina weddings have become so rare
that one outﬁt, Falsa Boda, has started staging wedding-themed parties,
complete with fake vows. And in many countries marriage has become
unmoored from parenthood. In 2015 two-ﬁfths of all American babies
were born to unwed mothers. In France the proportion is 59%; in Colom-
bia it is 84%. Just 21% of Britons aged between 15 and 24 now agree that
people who want children should get married, half the share in 1989. 
The West seems set on a diﬀerent course from the rest of the world,

especially Asia, where traditional attitudes persist. In rural Chi-
na a single man in his late 20s is seen as pathetic and perhaps
even dangerous. In Japan only 2% of births are to unmarried
women; in India and across much of north Africa and the Middle
East the share may be even lower. In many poor and middle-in-
come countries the law still does not recognise unmarried cou-
ples and treats their oﬀspring as virtual non-people. 
This special report will argue that much of what people
think they know about marriage is wrong. In the West the institu-
tion is more resilient than it seems, although profoundly
changed since the mid-20th century. In Asia, it is much more ﬂuid
and unstable than it might appear. What look like fundamental
cultural diﬀerences between West and East are often just diﬀer-
ences of timing and degree. Marriage is being transformed al-
most everywhere, and in many of the same ways. But diﬀerent
countries are at diﬀerent stages of the journey. 
From west London to Chinese villages to Indian slums,
three great changes are afoot. The ﬁrst is that marriage decisions
are being wrenched out of the hands of parents and relatives and
made by the young people themselves. The clearest sign of this is
the almost universal rise in the average age of marriage (see chart
below). There is still a large gap between Norway, where women
marry at an average age of 32, and Bangladesh, where they wed
at 19. But there is also a crucial diﬀerence between marrying at 19
and at 16, which was the average in Bangladesh in 1974. 
The second change is the emphasis on conjugal love. For
much of Western history romantic love, or “familiarity”, was
held not only to be unnecessary for a strong marriage but anti-
thetical to it. William Gouge, an inﬂuential Puritan writer in 17th-
century England, lambasted women who called their husbands
“sweet, sweeting, heart, sweet-heart, love, joy, dear…duck, chick,
pigsnie &c”, terms that struck him as undermining the wifely de-
ference essential for a successful union. Many English couples
probably ignored Gouge and went on murmuring sweet noth-
ings, which is why he was able to collect so many of them. But his
view was perfectly orthodox at the time. 
Today love is triumphant. The merchants at the National
Wedding Show invariably report that every couple insists on
their wedding being romantic and special. “You don’t have to get
married these days,” explains Anna Muckart, who makes
charming wedding invitations. And because weddings are no
longer obligatory, they must be extraordinary. Marriage has
changed from being a rite of passage to a celebration of love and
commitment—a sign that two people who already live together
are ready to commit themselves further. Asian brides and

grooms often demur, arguing that marriage should be entered
with a cool head and that weddings join families, not just cou-
ples. But even they now stress what they call “compatibility”. 
When love is the basis for marriage, it follows that a mar-
riage without love should be put asunder. The third great global
change is the growing acceptance of divorce. It is now more com-
mon in many countries, especially fast-modernising ones where
women are becoming economically self-suﬃcient. These days
China and South Korea have divorce rates above the European
and OECD averages. 

Where breaking up is hard to do

Churches and governments have often tried to resist these
changes. Usually they have been humiliated. In America, even
government-funded studies conclude that federal programmes
aimed at strengthening marriage have almost no eﬀect. Attempt-
ing to preserve unions by making divorce more diﬃcult might
just lead to fewer marriages. In Chile divorce was almost impos-
sible until 2004 and is still not easy. Probably not coincidentally,
Chile has the highest proportion of births outside marriage
among the 35 members of the OECD. 
Almost everywhere marriage is becoming less obligatory,
less coercive and less dutiful. It has not, however, lost any of its
appeal or its private binding power. A recent survey of young
Britons found that 93% aspire to marry. Even in countries where
divorce is socially acceptable, people still believe that marriage is
a special bond, not to be made or broken lightly. Its eﬀects are ex-
pressed more accurately by novelists than by statisticians. The
single life is rather like riding a moped, explains a character in
“The Age of Grief”, a story by the American writer Jane Smiley:
you feel every bump in the road. A marriage, particularly a mar-
riage with children, is like an 18-wheel lorry barrelling along. 
Study after study testiﬁes that married people are healthier,
wealthier and happier than unmarried ones, and less likely to
split from their partners. It is hard to tell how much of this is be-
cause they are married and how much is a selection eﬀect—hap-
py, healthy people in strong relationships being more likely to get
married in the ﬁrst place. But academics who have tried to con-
trol for those things still tend to ﬁnd a marriage eﬀect. Wedlock
seems to increase human happiness even allowing for the fact
that many marriages fall apart. 
In rich countries, the institution of marriage increasingly
confers advantages on people who already have many. Aﬄuent,
highly educated men and women marry late and after careful
consideration. Their marriages are highly successful—on aver-
age, almost certainly the happiest and most fulﬁlling that the
world has ever seen. Among this privileged group, divorce is in-

creasingly rare. The marrying classes of the West are building un-
ions as resilient as the dutiful ones found in poorer countries. 
For many others, however, marriage seems to be moving
out of reach. The working classes have become much less likely
to marry than the middle classes, and when they do, their un-
ions are more liable to break down quickly. Most working-class
people still idealise marriage, but think of it as something to be
undertaken at some point in the future, or perhaps not at all. 
This report will examine the growing social divide in West-
ern marriage, as well as an even more extreme social cleft in Chi-
na, where a shortage of women may leave tens of millions of
poor men without brides. But it begins in India, where weddings
rival cricket as the nation’s favourite pastime, and where old
marriage practices are being discarded at alarming speed. 7

Marr iage in India

The triumph of love

As parents lose control over marr iage, Indian society
is shaking

INTO A CRAMPED, stuﬀy room on the outskirts of Delhi
shuﬄes a middle-aged woman in a yellow sari. Giving her
name as Nirmala, she launches into an account of a marriage
gone horribly wrong. Her husband has become a drunkard, she
says. He often comes in late and is sick on the ﬂoor. When drunk,
he can be violent: recently he tried to strangle Nirmala, injuring
her neck. Nirmala’s father- and mother-in-law, with whom she
and her husband share a home, are bullies who accuse her of ly-
ing in bed all day. So she has moved out to live with her parents. 
Nirmala’s husband, Chiranjit, has also turned up at the
hearing, which is a mahila panchayat—a sort of informal mar-
riage court run by women. He disputes little of what his wife has
said. He points out, however, that he has defended Nirmala

S P E C I A L R E P O R T

M A R R I A G E

against his brother, who has tried to beat her. He also says that
she has attacked him on occasion. 
The marriage would appear to be over. But that is not the
conclusion drawn by Nirmala or Chiranjit, both of whom say
they wish to be reconciled. The two dozen local women who
have gathered to hear their case agree. Chiranjit should stop
abusing his wife, defend her against his parents and clean up
after himself when he is sick, they declare. For her part, Nirmala
should reduce the sum she is demanding from her husband to
get her injured neck treated. Fine, says Nirmala. She will return
home, though if things do not improve, she will ﬁle for divorce.
India remains a highly traditional society. Marriage is much
more about binding families, and much less about personal
choice and fulﬁlment, than in most other parts of the world. Ar-
ranged marriages are so much the norm that people who ﬁnd
their own partners sometimes seek to disguise the fact. Among
Hindus, caste barriers appear insurmountable. 
But change is afoot, especially in the crowded, sprawling
cities where a growing proportion of Indians live. Astonishingly
quickly, India’s most important social institution is being re-
shaped. Traditionalists loathe these changes; Westernised elites
celebrate them. But even they underestimate the transformation. 
Many young Indians now have mobile phones, which
make secret courting easier. The growth of marriage websites
and, more recently, dating websites has given them more control
over the search for a partner. And India is becoming wealthier,
more urban and more educated. A quarter of young Indians now
go to university, and half of all students are women. Because
marriage is usually delayed until people have ﬁnished studying
and found a job, brides and grooms are growing older. As recent-
ly as 2005-06, 47% of Indian women in their early 20s were mar-
ried before their 18th birthday. By 2015-16 the share had fallen to
27%—and just 18% in the cities. 
Pandit Rajesh Sharma, a Hindu priest with a sideline as a
marriage broker, says that power has shifted over the past 15
years or so. Although parents might seek marriage partners for
their children, the ﬁnal decision now rests with the young, espe-
cially among the urban middle classes. One large survey shows
that the more educated the woman, the more likely she is to have
met or communicated with her husband
before the wedding day (see chart on the
next page). 
The perfectly chaste bride is going
out of fashion, too, says Ajit Singh, a priv-
ate investigator in Delhi. Mr Singh has a
theatrical detective’s hat and dark glasses,
but spends much of his time on the un-
glamorous task of checking out prospec-
tive marriage partners on behalf of par-
ents. Women’s families usually want to
know whether a man is as aﬄuent as he
says he is, and whether his mother is a bul-
ly. Men’s parents, for their part, want to
know about a prospective bride’s roman-
tic entanglements. To them, Mr Singh de-
livers a warning. It is a good idea to ﬁnd
out whether a girl currently has a serious
boyfriend and whether she has been en-
gaged before, he says. But prying any fur-
ther will only lead to disappointment.
“Everybody has a past,” he explains. 
Caste is weakening more than ap-
pearances suggest. Amit Ahuja, a political
scientist at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, has tested it by signing up

eligible grooms to three of India’s largest marriage websites. The
men, who were very similar in every respect other than their
caste, contacted women and measured how they responded.
Many of these men seemed to be snubbed just because of their
background. For example, only 33% of aﬄuent upper-caste wom-
en responded to advances from successful lower-caste men. In-
triguingly, though, 60% of less aﬄuent upper-caste women ex-
pressed an interest in such men. That suggests Hindus now see
caste not as an impenetrable barrier but as a bonus in the mar-
riage market, like a university education or fair skin. 
Sometimes urban anonymity and technology enable
young people to challenge more fundamental social rules. In

weds, Shazia and Subobh. They are an Indian rarity: a mixed
Hindu-Muslim couple. They met when Subobh rented an an-
nexe of Shazia’s parents’ house, from which he ran a mobile-
phone business. The courting couple talked long into the night
on their mobile phones. When the two sets of parents eventually
learned about the romance, they were deeply shocked. But they
accepted it, and the marriage went ahead. 
These changes seem disconcertingly quick. The West took
centuries to articulate an ideal of companionate marriage, and
decades after that to elaborate social codes around dating and
premarital sex, points out Ira Trivedi, a novelist who has written
a book about marriage in India. In her country everything is hap-
pening at once. Until recently, she points out, many Indian men
were unaccustomed to the sight of a woman’s exposed upper
arms. Suddenly they can download Tinder, a dating app created
in Silicon Valley. 
Conservatives consider the changes outrageous. Informal
male-dominated courts known as khap panchayats strive to pre-
vent inter-caste marriages (and, it is whispered, wink at honour
killings). Hindu nationalists fume about “love jihad”—marriages
between Hindus and Muslims in which the Hindu partner con-
verts to Islam. India’s Supreme Court is currently hearing a case
brought by a middle-aged Hindu man whose daughter had mar-
ried a Muslim whom she had met at medical college. A lower
court had annulled the marriage, declaring that the new bride
was “weak and vulnerable” and ought to have consulted her par-
ents before the wedding. 
For Madhu Purnima Kishwar, a culturally conservative
feminist, nothing less than the future of Indian society is at stake.

CHARLES DARWIN MARRIED his cousin, and
may have regretted it. The great scientist’s
exper iments on plants later convinced him of
the “evil eﬀects” of persistent inbreeding. In
1870 he wrote to an MP, suggesting that the
upcoming national census ask parents wheth-
er they were blood relatives. For, as he noted,
consanguineous marr iages were commonly
said to produce children who suﬀered from
“deafness and dumbness, blindness &c”.
Darwin’s request was turned down.
Br itain did not star t keeping records of
marr iages between ﬁrst cousins, nor did it
ban the practice, as some Amer ican states
were doing at the time. Instead, Br itish
society gradually changed so that marr iage
between cousins became undesirable, verg-
ing on unthinkable. The same is now happen-
ing across the world. 
Data are patchy, but the trend is clear.
In Jordan, 57% of marr iages in 1990 were
consanguineous, but by 2012 the ﬁgure had
dropped to 35%. Surveys of Israeli Arabs
suggest that 20% of marr iages before 2000
were between ﬁrst cousins, compared with
12% in 2005-09. Consanguineous marr iage

has also declined in Pakistan, Turkey and
south India. It seems to be growing nowhere
except Qatar. 
Health workers take credit for the
decline. They have argued for years that
consanguineous marr iage increases the r isk
of genetic disease, on good evidence. One of
the best studies is of Bradford, in nor thern
England, where 37% of ethnic Pakistani
babies born between 2007 and 2011 were the
children of ﬁrst cousins. Researchers found
that cousin marr iage doubled the r isk of bir th
defects, from 3% to 6%. 
Not all bir th defects are ser ious, how-
ever, and a slightly higher r isk of medical
problems might not always be evident. Be-
sides, there are arguments in favour of con-
sanguineous marr iage. In dowry cultures,
women who marry relatives usually have to
br ing less money to the marr iage. Parents
who are blood relations will raise their chil-
dren within a tight kinship web which may
provide strong suppor t. One survey in Oman
showed that a major ity of respondents un-
derstood the health r isks of having children
with a cousin, but a larger major ity approved

of the practice all the same. 
Yet cousin marr iage is doomed, if only
for demographic reasons. In many countr ies
where it is common, bir th rates are plunging.
In the early 1980s Pakistan’s fer tility rate was
6.4 (meaning that a woman could expect to
have that many children dur ing her child-
bear ing years). That number is now thought
to have come down to 3.4, and UN demog-
raphers expect it to fall to 2.4 by the early
2040s. In Iran, the fer tility rate has crashed
from 6.5 in the early 1980s to just 1.6.
Two academics, Bilal Barakat and Stuar t
Gietel-Basten, point out that when women
usually have ﬁve surviving children, a woman
can expect to have 25 male cousins. When the
average number of children falls to two, that
same woman will have just three male cous-
ins, some or all of whom might be younger
than she is, and thus ineligible as marr iage
par tners. The marr iage squeeze will be even
tighter in cultures that insist, for example,
that a woman marry not any old cousin but
her father’s brother’s son. Eventually, cousin
marr iage will be crushed not by medics but by
mathematics.

ﬁance of parents’ wishes—do not last, she says. And when mar-
riage ceases to be a family concern and becomes a purely private
matter, family obligations of all kinds are forgotten. If Indian par-
ents relinquish their control over their children’s marriages, the
country will be on a slippery slope to Western-style teenage
pregnancies and old people left to moulder in retirement homes. 
This is a caricature of the West—where, in fact, teenage preg-
nancies are rarer than they are in India. But conservatives are
right to fear changes to marriage. There is indeed a link between
arranged marriage and wider family obligations. Formally, at
least, much of India is patrilocal: married couples are expected to
live with the husband’s parents. If a man’s parents help him pick
a bride, it is because they are also picking a live-in companion
and, eventually, a nurse for their dotage. 

Cracks in the system

Once this web of obligations begins to fail, it can collapse
quickly. What should worry conservative Indians is not so much
that their country will go the way of America but that it will fol-
low Japan. Arranged marriage was the norm in Japan before the
second world war, and many retired Japanese lived with their
children. Today arranged marriage is almost unknown in Japan,
and children feel little obligation to take in their aged parents. 
In India, meanwhile, marriage is also quietly eroding from
below. Nirmala’s threat notwithstanding, slum-dwellers whose
marriages collapse seldom bother with divorce. Instead they
separate from their spouses and take up with new partners.
Sometimes they announce that they are now married to their
new loves. Technically this is illegal, but nobody seems minded
to interfere. “In all these years I have hardly ever seen a prosecu-
tion for bigamy,” says Gouri Choudhury of Action India, a chari-
ty, who has been working with poor city women since the 1970s. 
Nervously and unsteadily, India is letting go of old ways
and groping towards something that resembles Western mar-
riage. At the same time the West is in one sense turning more In-
dian. The idea that the best marriage partner is someone with
the same family background and belonging to precisely the
same social group seems to be rooted in the subcontinent. But
something that looks remarkably like caste marriage is becoming
increasingly common in rich countries. 7

The West

For richer

In wealthy countr ies, marr iage is no longer a r ite of
passage but a sign of having arr ived

IN A CLASSROOM in southern England, a group of 17-year-
old girls has just learned something extraordinary. The pu-
pils are interviewing a couple, Jane and Graham Marshall, who
have been sent to their school by the Students Exploring Mar-
riage Trust, a charity that tries to promote wedlock by providing
teenagers with real-life examples. Mr Marshall has mentioned
that he has been married to Mrs Marshall for 48 years. “Aww,”
say the girls. Then they stop to think, because Jane and Graham
do not look terribly old. Hold on, asks one pupil after a few sec-
onds—how old were you when you got married? Nineteen, says
Mr Marshall. The pupils gasp. “Whoa!” says one. 
It is a long cultural journey from half a century ago to the
present. Out of every 1,000 unmarried adult women living in

The Economist November 25th 2017 

Joining the uxar iat

England and Wales in 1970, whether single, divorced or wid-
owed, 60 got hitched. Women married for the ﬁrst time at a me-
dian age of 21, to men who were two years older. One-third of
brides under 20 were bounced into marriage, with a baby arriv-
ing less than eight months after the wedding. To have a child out-
side wedlock was almost unthinkable. 
These days the marriage rate in England and Wales is just 21
per 1,000 single women in any one year. The median age at ﬁrst
marriage has climbed to 30 for women and 31 for men. Having
children outside marriage is almost the norm. Fully 48% of Eng-
lish and Welsh babies were born to unmarried mothers in 2016,
up from 8% in 1970. 
Marriage is no longer thought essential, even for raising
children. Even so, Britons seem to idealise marriage more than
ever. A once universal institution has become the mark of having
made it, both romantically and economically. Among the privi-
leged group of people who attain wedlock—call them the uxa-
riat—marriage is becoming more egalitarian and more resilient.
These changes are reﬂected in wedding ceremonies, in the divi-
sion of housework and in bed. 
NatCen Social Research, an independent institute, has
been surveying Britons’ attitudes to sex and marriage since the
early 1980s. In almost every respect, it ﬁnds that people are be-
coming more liberal. In 2016, for example, 75% of Britons de-
clared that premarital sex was not wrong at all, up from 42% in
1983. With each passing survey, fewer people say that couples
who want children ought to marry ﬁrst. But there is an important
exception to this easy-going rule. All Britons, especially young
ones, now take a more critical view of aﬀairs. Marriage seems
ever less necessary but also ever more inviolate. 
An ever-shrinking share of the population embarks on it. In
the ﬁrst quarter of 2017, 65% of top professional adults in Britain
were married, according to the Labour Force Survey. For people
in routine jobs the proportion was 44%, and for the unemployed
and those who had never worked 40%. Among women with
young children the social divide is even sharper. The Marriage

Foundation, a charity, calculates that 87% of women in the high-
est-earning quintile with children under ﬁve are married, com-
pared with only 24% in the lowest-earning quintile.
It is not quite accurate to say that in Britain the rich marry
and the poor do not. Rather, marriage is favoured by well-oﬀ
people and some ethnic minorities, especially immigrants and
the oﬀspring of immigrants from countries such as Bangladesh,
India, Pakistan and Somalia, which have strong marriage cul-
tures. The part of Britain with the lowest proportion of births
outside marriage, at 20%, is Harrow, a middle-class London sub-
urb where less than one-third of the population is white British.
The highest rate, at 75%, is in Knowsley, a poor suburb of Liver-
pool where 19 out of 20 people are white Britons. 
Laura and Richard, a middle-class couple in their late 20s
living in Leeds, will marry next year. Both are clear about the
proper order: marriage ﬁrst, then children. They are less clear
about why they believe this. Laura is Catholic but Richard is not,
and she does not ascribe her views to her faith. “It’s just how I’ve
always thought I want my life to be,” she says. It is probably sig-
niﬁcant, though, that almost everybody she and Richard know
has done the same thing. 
As marriage becomes the preserve of such careful people,
unions are growing more resilient. If you wanted it to last, the
worst years to marry in England and Wales, statistically, were in
the mid-1990s. Among those who tied the knot in 1996, 11% had
split up by the ﬁfth year of marriage and 25% by the tenth. Cou-
ples who married a decade later are faring better. Among those
who wed in 2006, 8% had split by their ﬁfth year and 20% by their
tenth year. More recent cohorts seem to be even more steadfast. 
Much the same is happening in other countries. Across Eu-
rope, except in Belgium, highly educated women are less likely to
have children outside marriage. In America education and mar-
riage go hand-in-hand, to the extent that marriage rates are now
higher among women with PhDs than among women with
bachelor’s degrees. At the age of 45, the average university-edu-
cated American man has led a fairly straightforward personal
life. Fully 88% of such men have married, and three-quarters of
those are still married to their ﬁrst wives. Men who did not ﬁnish
high school are less likely to have married and, if they have, more
likely to have divorced (see chart). 
The marrying classes have become ever better at picking
partners who are similar to them. Three academic economists,
Pierre-André Chiappori, Bernard Salanié and Yoram Weiss, have
shown that white Americans are increasingly likely to marry
partners of the same educational level. This trend is sometimes
ascribed to the growing numbers of female graduates, but the
economists control for that and still ﬁnd evidence of growing se-
lectivity. Other studies show that women tend to marry men
who share their attitude to ﬁnancial risk, and that people with
similar levels of parental wealth tend to end up together. 
These marriages of social and educational equals seem to

be satisfying, especially for women—who, at least in Britain,
drive divorce trends. Since 1979 British men have consistently
ﬁled between 38,000 and 48,000 divorce petitions per year.
Women, by contrast, went from ﬁling 96,000 petitions in 1979 to
118,000 in 1993, before dropping to 65,000 in 2016. 
Perhaps husbands have become less objectionable. Aca-
demics at Oxford University have shown that although women
still do more housework than men, the gap has narrowed every-
where. In 1974 British women cleaned, cooked and laundered for
172 hours a year more than men. By 2005 they were putting in
only 74 hours more. In America, the diﬀerence between the time
married working women and men spent doing housework each
day fell from 38 to 28 minutes between 2003-06 and 2011-15. 

Be fair

Not only are men behaving better; women increasingly
prize better behaviour among men. Daniel Carlson, a sociologist
at the University of Utah, has shown that couples (whether mar-
ried or cohabiting) who share child care and housework duties
more equally report greater satisfaction in their relationships
and in their sex lives. In the 1980s and 1990s the opposite was
true. Men and women used to be content to specialise—he pay-
ing the mortgage, she changing the nappies. No longer. 
For those who achieve it, marriage increasingly looks like a
triumph. More than in the past, it is a fulﬁlling union between
two people who collaborate (if still rather unequally) in child
care, housework and money-earning. Almost all couples now
live together before they marry, so people are well aware of what
their partners expect of them. Most will have several more years
to ﬁne-tune their behaviour before the arrival of children. 
Weddings have come to express this triumphant view. Now
that couples are older and wealthier, gifts are downplayed: some
ask for donations to a favourite charity. Brides and grooms splash
out on lavish ceremonies that demonstrate their devotion to
each other. Mathilde Robert, managing director of Planet Wed-
dings, has been organising ceremonies for British couples in Cy-
prus and Greece since the early 1990s. In the early years, she says,
most of her clients were middle-aged and marrying for the sec-
ond time. They had money and wanted to treat themselves; most
invited only a few guests. These days most of her clients are mar-
rying for the ﬁrst time and invite dozens of people. The majority
pay for the wedding themselves. 
There is, however, a cost to this kind of marriage. If you in-
sist on a strong relationship and a healthy bank balance before
tying the knot, and on piling up even more wealth before starting
a family, your chances of having the number of children you
want become slimmer. In most rich countries, the more highly
qualiﬁed the woman, the more likely she is to remain childless.
Many childless people are perfectly happy. But others endure ex-
pensive medical treatment and great disappointment.
Little wonder, then, that many people choose a diﬀerent

The challenge from gay marr iage is not what conser vatives predicted

THE SCRIPT IS familiar by now. Suppor ters
talk about freedom and equality, and point
out that many other countr ies allow it. Oppo-
nents pose as plucky defenders of traditional
norms, and warn that schools will push
homosexuality and gender confusion on
children. Then gay marr iage becomes the law
of the land. Australia is the latest country to
go through these motions: on November 15th
a major ity of voters suppor ted gay marr iage
in a non-binding plebiscite. The excitement
will be quickly forgotten. 
Few things have gone from unthinkable
to normal with such speed. “I can’t go that
far—that’s the year 2000,” said President
Richard Nixon in 1970 about a lawyer who
appeared to favour same-sex marr iage. But
the US Supreme Cour t upheld gay marr iage in
2015, and a poll earlier this year found that
64% of Amer icans now approve of it. 
One possible explanation for the non-
chalance is that the number of gay marr iages
has been fairly small. When they were legal-
ised in Br itain in March 2014, the govern-
ment expected more than 9,000 gay wed-
dings in the following year, but fewer than
6,000 took place. “It hasn’t taken oﬀ as I
would have hoped,” says Emma Joanne of
Shotgun Weddings, a photography ﬁrm
based in Br ighton, Br itain’s gayest burgh.

Amer ican polling data suggests that just one
in ten lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
adults are marr ied to somebody of the same
sex. Many gay people are young, and young
people seldom marry, regardless of their
sexual leanings. 
Women have been keenest to go down
the aisle. In Br itain, Sweden and the Neth-

erlands, marr iages between women out-
number marr iages between men. Women’s
unions are also more likely to break down. In
the Netherlands, which legalised same-sex
marr iage in 2001, 82.1% of opposite-sex
marr iages joined in 2005 were still intact in
2016, compared with only 69.6% of mar-
r iages between women. Gay men were the
commitment champions: 84.5% of their
marr iages had endured. 
Opponents of gay marr iage sometimes
fret that it will spoil straight people’s appe-
tite for the traditional kind, but no evidence
for this has emerged. Still, the long battle for
gay marr iage has lef t some traces. Many
countr ies permitted gay civil par tnerships
before acceding to demands for marr iage,
and some have allowed straight couples to
enter into such par tnerships too. In the
Netherlands this option has become popular.
In 2016, 19% of all formal unions there were
par tnerships, up from 9% a decade earlier.
These have almost all the legal force of mar-
r iage but few of the costly r itual tr immings
(the most popular day to get par tnered is
Monday). Their popular ity in one country
suggests that some of the people now
squeezing into wedding gowns might opt for
a cheaper kind of union, so long as it was not
digniﬁed by the name of marr iage.

trade-oﬀ. In another paper, Mr Carlson examines what a mixed-
race cohort of young Americans expected of life when they were
interviewed in 1979 and what actually happened to them. Their
aspirations were almost identical. Fully 98% of whites and His-
panics and 94% of blacks expected to marry, and all reckoned
they would embark on parenthood at 23 or 24. White Americans
hit the ﬁrst target, more or less—90% ended up marrying—but
were, on average, three years late in having children. Blacks and
Hispanics, who in America are disproportionately working-
class, came closer to hitting their ideal child-bearing age but fell
far short of their marriage targets. Only 83% of Hispanics and 68%
of blacks ended up marrying. 
“Poor people and rich people want the same things,” says
Kathryn Edin, who studies the romantic lives of impoverished
Americans. If anything, she says, the least fortunate cling most
tightly to a romantic marriage ideal. Faced with messy reality,
though, people of diﬀerent means prioritise diﬀerent things.
Poor women tend to put children above marriage, largely be-
cause the men they might marry are not up to much. 

A lost world

For a glimpse of working-class life and love in the mid-20th
century, there is little better than Stan Barstow’s British novel of
1960, “A Kind of Loving”. Its protagonist, Vic Brown, is dragged
into a miserable marriage after he gets his 18-year-old girlfriend
pregnant. If that seems like an account of a lost world, so is the la-

bour market depicted in the novel. Characters walk out of stable
jobs and into new ones with ease. At one point, a man who has
been chastised by his boss for ﬁghting calmly takes out a newspa-
per and runs his ﬁnger down the job advertisements.
These days a pregnant 18-year-old would probably not mar-
ry her boyfriend even if he asked. He may well be incapable of
supporting her and the baby, and she has better options outside
marriage than she did in 1960. Jobs for thinly educated men have
become insecure and unrewarding. In America, wages for men
who did not complete high school fell by 32% in real terms be-
tween 1979 and 2015; and men who ﬁnished high school but did
not go to university earned 19% less than they did. Women fared
somewhat better: pay for female school dropouts fell by 10%,
whereas pay for those who ﬁnished high school was up by 4%. 
That bleak economic reality helps to explain why attempts
to promote marriage have such a dismal record. America’s feder-
al government has given hundreds of millions of dollars to pro-
grammes that seek to nudge poor people into wedlock or teach
couples how to resolve conﬂict. These programmes have been
found to have hardly any eﬀect. 
Conservatives point out that none of the barriers to mar-
riage in Western societies are insurmountable. It is not necessary
to have a lavish wedding. A man who sometimes drops out of
work might nonetheless prove a good husband and father. Pov-
erty does not in itself prevent anybody from tying the knot—at
least not in Western countries. In China it does. 7

China

In search of women

A shortage of br ides is bending Chinese society out 
of shape

IN PI VILLAGE, on the outskirts of Beijing, a man in his late
50s who gives his name as Ren is mixing cement for a new
apartment building. As he shovels, he gives an account of bride-
price inﬂation. When he married, his parents gave his wife 800
yuan, which seemed like a lot. Twelve years ago one of Mr Ren’s
sons married. His bride got 8,000 yuan. Recently another son
married, and Mr Ren had to stump up 100,000 yuan ($15,000).
He is likely to be mixing cement well into his 60s. 
Like India, most of China is patrilocal: in theory, at least, a
married woman moves into her husband’s home and looks after
his parents. Also like India, China has a deep cultural preference
for boys. But whereas India has dowries, China has bride prices.
The groom’s parents, not the bride’s, are expected to pay for the
wedding and give money and property to the couple. These
bride prices have shot up, bending the country’s society and
economy out of shape. 
The cause, as Mr Ren explains, is a shortage of women.
Without human intervention, about 105 boys will be born for ev-
ery 100 girls: boys and men are slightly more likely to die, so by
the time they reach reproductive age the number of men and
women should be roughly equal. But many Chinese couples
have tipped the scales. Driven partly by China’s now-aban-
doned one-child policy, they have used ultrasound scans to de-
termine the sex of fetuses and then aborted some of the girls. By
2010 there were 119 boys under ﬁve years old for every 100 girls.
Two demographers, John Bongaarts and Christophe Guilmoto,
estimate that China is missing more than 60m women and girls. 
In the province of Shandong, in eastern China, the child sex
ratio skewed early and drastically. It was highly unbalanced by
1990, and by 2010 had reached 123:100. Moreover, not all Shan-
dong girls hang around awaiting marriage proposals from local
boys. The province lies between Beijing and Shanghai, so it is
easy for the province’s young women—said to be unusually tall
and beautiful—to migrate to the great metropolises in search of
work and boyfriends. The result is a severe shortage, and bride
prices that are barmy even by Chinese standards.

Get thee to a monaster y

In Zhongdenglou, a tidy village in western Shandong, 30-
year-old Deng Zhikuan runs a grocery store. When he married,
ten years ago, bride prices in the village were between 2,000 and
3,000 yuan. Now they run between 200,000 and 300,000 yuan,
although Mr Deng hears that as much as 500,000 has been hand-
ed over (50,000 yuan would be a respectable annual salary
thereabouts). 

Past it at 25

Other villagers give similar ﬁgures. It is a buyer’s market,
complains Qiang Lizhi, a newly married man who runs a café
nearby. A 47-year-old man, Deng Xinling, says that men are now
considered shopworn if they are unmarried at 25. By contrast, no
woman is thought too old to marry; even widows have no diﬃ-
culty in ﬁnding husbands. 
China’s growing sex imbalance is driving boys’ parents to
desperate lengths. Some add another storey to their houses, not
because they need the space but because a woman might be im-
pressed. They give money to their sons to buy gold jewellery and
pay for extravagant wedding photo shoots. They start saving ear-
ly, then go into debt. China has a sky-high household saving rate:
couples squirrel away 38% of disposable income, compared with
10% in notoriously frugal Germany. Two academics, Shang-Jin
Wei and Xiaobo Zhang, estimate that half the increase in China’s
saving rate between 1990 and 2007 can be attributed to the rising
cost of marriage in a society with too many men. 
Some fear that worse is to come. The unmarried male pop-
ulation is concentrated both geographically and socially. China’s
women are taking advantage of their scarcity value to marry
men from wealthier backgrounds, leaving many poor, illiterate
rural men on the shelf (see chart). In a country where respectable
adulthood is tied to marriage, the outcome could be a large pari-
ah population and an epidemic of prostitution, abduction and
organised crime in the countryside. 
But if rural China were heading for social Armageddon,
there ought to be some sign of it already. There is not. The inhabit-

ants of Zhongdenglou tell stories about brides being imported
from other countries, especially Vietnam—but these stories turn
out to come from the news media. They seem to view single men
with pity and scorn rather than alarm—“people will laugh,” says
Mr Qiang. Understandably, many unmarried men disappear,
migrating to jobs in the cities in order to build up their savings. By
the time they give up on marriage, in their 40s, they are too old to
cause much trouble. 
Perhaps the most likely outcome is that China will endure a
painful, decades-long marriage squeeze before the problem
solves itself. Silly bride prices are an economic signal to which
families are already responding. Lihong Shi, an anthropologist at
Case Western Reserve University in America, says that many ru-
ral Chinese families have already come to view sons more as eco-
nomic burdens than as security for their old age. If one believes
Chinese statistics, the sex ratio at birth has fallen from a peak of
121 boys to 100 girls in 2004 to 114:100 in 2015. 
Besides, as China becomes more mobile, patrilocal cus-
toms are breaking down. Married couples often live far from
their aged parents and support them by sending money home. It
turns out that daughters can look after their parents just as well
as sons—and, according to Ms Shi, are thought to be better at the
daily practicalities. Couples who failed to produce a boy 20 or 30
years ago, and endured the mockery of their neighbours, are hav-
ing the last laugh. 7

Parenthood

The four-handed
juggling act

Marr iage, it turns out, is still the best place for
children

IF YOU TAKE a long, wide view, marriage and personal re-
lationships are in ﬁne shape. Parental coercion is weaken-
ing; marriages are becoming more egalitarian; enormities such
as child marriage are fading. Even in countries where divorce is
common, most marriages last. A couple who tied the knot in Eng-
land or Wales in 2012 can be expected to stay together for 32
years, according to the Oﬃce for National Statistics. By contrast,
the average pre-industrial English marriage endured for just 15-20
years before one partner perished. The vows in the Anglican
wedding service, in which couples promise to love and cherish
each other “till death do us part”, used to be laden with doom. 
Nor, if only the couples are considered, is the spread of co-
habitation anything to worry about. Fewer people have jobs for
life these days, or even careers for life, so it seems odd to expect
them to leap into lifelong romantic commitments. Demogra-
phers used to argue that living together before marriage raised
the risk of early divorce. But couples who move from cohabita-
tion to marriage often start living together when they are quite
young, and what is risky is not sharing a bedroom before marry-
ing but living together in young adulthood, whether or not you
have a wedding ring when you embark on it. 
However, there is one big reason to worry about the quality
and longevity of people’s intimate bonds. It is that relationships
often produce children, and children are profoundly aﬀected by
how their parents get on. 
You could make enough confetti for a summer of weddings
with all the academic papers that show how much children gain
from being brought up in stable, loving families, and how much

they suﬀer when those families break down. Culture and cus-
toms make little diﬀerence. In Japan, four-ﬁfths of single-parent
households emerge when couples divorce—a much higher share
than in the West, where people usually slip into single parent-
hood without marrying. Japanese children living with only one
parent nonetheless perform signiﬁcantly worse in school tests,
just as children from single-parent families do in Europe and
America. In poorer countries, family breakdown can kill. Accord-
ing to one recent estimate, the chance that an African child will
die before turning ﬁve is about 25-30 per 1,000 for those born into
stable families, but 35-40 per 1,000 for the children of single, di-
vorced or widowed parents. 
Marriage is not always good for children. They do not bene-
ﬁt when a parent marries somebody who is not their mother or
father, and seem to suﬀer if the parent they live with cycles
through several relationships. What they seem to need most is
for their biological parents to stick together. And one strong claim
that can be made for marriage is that it appears to glue parents to-
gether more tightly than any other arrangement. 
Analysis of one large American data set by Kathryn Edin
and Laura Tach, two sociologists, shows that 27% of marriages
broke down within nine years of a child being born. By contrast,
among couples who were merely cohabiting when a child ap-
peared, 53% separated within nine years—and most of the re-
maining 47% were married by that point. Among couples who
were dating but not living together when the child was born, 81%
had split up. 
Again, this pattern runs across national and cultural bor-
ders. Cohabiting couples behave a bit more like married couples
in countries where giving birth outside marriage is very com-
mon, such as Estonia and Norway. But they seldom attain the
same level of stickiness as married couples, even after control-
ling for the mother’s level of education. 

Deconstructing marr iage

Statistical controls are important. Some people are more
likely to choose to wed than others. Married people tend to be
not just more highly educated than unmarried ones but also
wealthier, older, more religious, more cheerful and more likely to
own a home. Many of these characteristics are also associated
with happy, successful children. 
Studies that have wrestled with this problem have conclud-
ed that the greater the number of personal characteristics you
control for, the less magical wedlock appears to be. Yet the eﬀect
of marriage cannot quite be controlled away to zero. Ms Edin and
Ms Tach found that more than two-thirds of the diﬀerence in the
nine-year break-up rate between married parents and those who

1

S P E C I A L R E P O R T

M A R R I A G E

2 are only dating when a child is born can be explained by perso-
nal characteristics (such as education, employment, criminal his-
tory and women’s feelings about men). But that still leaves al-
most a third of the diﬀerence attributable to marriage or to other,
unmeasured factors. 
Another researcher, Rebecca Ryan, adds an intriguing wrin-
kle. After controlling for various selection eﬀects, she ﬁnds that
the children of married parents at age three do better on a stan-
dard picture vocabulary test (which might ask them to point to a
drawing of a mouse or a laughing person). But this is only true, on
average, for the children of married parents whose background
suggests they were likely to marry. So cajoling young, poor cou-
ples into marriage might not help their oﬀspring. 
As some researchers grapple with the slippery question of
what marriage does, others are studying how parents bring up
children. They ﬁnd huge diﬀerences not just between well-edu-
cated, privileged people and others but between modern par-
ents and past ones. When their conclusions are set next to those
of the marriage researchers, the consequences of marriage be-
come a little clearer. 

Committed to the cause

With apologies to older readers of The Economist: parents
these days take a lot more trouble over the job, or at least middle-
class parents do. One analysis of 11 rich countries estimates that
the average mother spent 54 minutes a day caring for children in
1965 but 104 minutes in 2012. Men do less than women, but far
more than men in the past: their child-caring time has jumped
from 16 minutes a day to 59. 
At the same time a gap has opened between working-class
and middle-class parents. In 1965 mothers with and without a
university education spent about the same amount of time on
child care. By 2012 the more educated ones were spending half
an hour more per day. (The exception is France, where the stereo-
type of a bourgeois couple sipping wine and ignoring their re-
markably well-behaved progeny appears to be accurate.) In
America, another analysis shows that black children under two
on average receive one hour a day less attention from parents
than white children. The explanation seems to be more poverty
among blacks. 
Privileged parents also give their children a diﬀerent kind
of attention. They play more. They tend to respond to children’s
questions with questions of their own. They ﬁll their children’s

Some parents
have
schedules for
their oﬀspring
stretching 18 months into the fu-
ture, known in America as
“mom planners”. In short, they
engage in what Annette Lareau,
a sociologist at the University of
Pennsylvania, calls “concerted
cultivation”. And still their chil-
dren complain of being bored. 
Though this style of child-
rearing is easy to mock, the pro-
blem with concerted cultivation
is not that it is ridiculous, but
that it is extremely eﬀective. Af-
ﬂuent children raised in this
way are exposed to many more
words and complex ideas than
poorer children. Ms Lareau,
who studied a dozen families
over many years, found that the
upper-middle-class children be-
came far better at negotiating
with institutions to get what
they wanted—skills that helped
them later in life. 
This style of child-raising
requires a lot of time and cultur-
al knowledge, though, not to
mention a lot of money. Working-class parents, who love their
children no less, tend to lack these things. They also lack the insti-
tutional awareness and the powerful friends that would help
them take on a teacher when things go wrong for a child at
school. Their approach to child-rearing tends to rest on the idea
that children grow up by themselves, and need above all to be
kept happy and safe. 
In this context, the true purpose of middle-class marriage
becomes apparent. People fall in love with and marry people
who are just as highly educated as themselves. They deﬁne and
express their shared values through expensive wedding celebra-
tions. After marriage, they continue to
ﬁne-tune their relationships and pool
their resources. When children appear,
they put their accumulated social and cul-
tural capital to work. Married couples en-
gage in a demanding four-handed jug-
gling act that prepares their oﬀspring for
success at school, university and the most
demanding jobs. Their children marry
well, and the cycle begins again. 
All this can be done by couples who
are not married; it can also be done by sin-
gle parents. But it is probably a little easier
with the additional glue and social recog-
nition that marriage brings—and the
sharp-elbowed middle classes will take
any advantage they can get. As well as
promising to love and cherish, marrying
couples might as well vow to transmit ev-
ery one of their social advantages to their
children—though somehow that sounds a
little less romantic. 7

Whatev-erhappens, votersare goingto need pa-tience overthe comingweeks. 7LASTJanuary, shortlyafterDonald Trumpwassworn in asAmerica’spresident,telephonesstarted to ringin several Senateoﬃces. The White House, staﬀerslearned,wasdraftingan executive orderto lift someofthe sanctionsimposed on Russia in re-sponse to itswaragainstUkraine in 2014.“We were horriﬁed. Everyone wascallingeach otherand we soon realised thatallheard the same thing,” one recalls.The staﬀerspromptlyleaked the ru-mour, and began workon a bill to turn thesanctions, imposed byexecutive order un-derBarackObama, into law. The idea wasto stop MrTrump from liftingthem unilat-erally. Although the earliersanctions wererelated to the Russian invasion ofUkraine,itwasevidence ofRussia’smeddlinginAmerica’selections, notto mention MrTrump’sworryinglyconsistentpraise ofVladimirPutin, Russia’spresident, thatpropelled Congressinto action. The resultwasthe CounterAmerica’sAdversariesThrough SanctionsAct(CAATSA, whichalso includesmeasuresagainstIran andNorth Korea), the onlypiece oflegislationto be almostunanimouslysupported byboth partiesin Congress. Passed by419-3 inthe House and 98-2 in the Senate, itleft MrTrump with no choice butto sign orhavehisveto overridden. The newlaw, signed in August, en-trenchesand in placestightensthe sanc-tionsof2014, which have cutoﬀRussianﬁrmsfrom mostWestern sourcesofﬁnanc-ing. Economically, theycompounded theeﬀectsofthe oil-price collapse on Russia’seconomyin 2014 and have hampered Rus-sia’sabilityto climb outofthe trough. Un-certaintyabouttheirscope hasmade for-eignerscautiousaboutdealingwith anyRussian ﬁrm, notjustwith those directlytargeted. Foreign directinvestmentin Rus-sia fell from $69bn in 2013 to just$6.8bn in2015. Yetwith time, businessesadjusted tothe newconditions. Western executivesgraduallyreturned to Russian gatherings.Foreign investorsagain gobbled up Rus-sian governmentbonds. Aswell asstoppingMrTrump frombacksliding, CAATSA moderatelyin-creasesthe pressure on the Russian econ-omy. Itextendsthe restrictionson investingin newRussian oil and gasprojectsto theoperationsofRussian ﬁrmsin third coun-tries. Yetthe eﬀectivenessofthese newsanctions, which the administration is al-lowed to pause until late January, is under-mined bythe factthatEuropean ﬁrms havebeen ring-fenced from theireﬀects. Gaz-prom, Russia’snatural-gasgiant, whichsuppliesEurope with a huge amountofgas, hasalso been excluded from the sanc-tionslists, asisNord Stream 2, a secondtrans-Balticgasexportpipeline to Ger-many. Some American oﬃcialswouldhave liked to see thatprojectblocked, butthe desire to preserve unitybetweenAmerica and the EU turned outto be moreimportant, saysDaniel Fried, a former USoﬃcial who designed the initial sanctions.America and Europe did notwantto falloutoverarmssales, either. CAATSA ex-tendsexistingsanctionsto make sure thatanyone engaged in a “signiﬁcanttransac-tion” with the Russian defence and securi-tysectorscan be aﬀected. Butastheworld’ssecond-largestexporterofarms,Russia suppliesmanyofAmerica’sfriends,includingIndia, Vietnam and Iraq, as wellassome NATO membersincludingTurkey,Greece and some formerWarsawPactmembersin eastern Europe. So decisionson applyingsanctionsto Russian armssaleswill also be made case bycase.Itisthe personal sanctionsthat worrythe Russian elite most. CAATSA allows“secondarysanctions”, meaningthatAmerican oﬃcialscan go afteranyone, inanycountry, with signiﬁcantbusinessdealingswith the so-called “speciallydes-ignated nationals” (SDNs) who are alreadyundersanctions—such asIgorSechin, thehead ofRosneft, the state oil ﬁrm, and Gen-nadyTimchenko, an oligarch with inter-estsin transportand energy. Depending onhowCAATSA isimplemented, thiscouldmake some ofMrPutin’sclosestalliesandcroniesastoxicasotherSDNsin Hizbullah,Iran orNorth Korea. AChinese energy ﬁrmora Western consultantdealingwith anyofthe Russian SDNscould be aﬀected.“Thisisabsolutelynuclear,” saysa Russianoﬃcial. “Itgoesbeyond anythingwe hadduringthe cold war.” AnotherpartofCAATSA requirestheadministration to submita reportto Con-gressidentifyingRussian oligarchsand se-niorforeign-policyoﬃcialswith close tiesto MrPutin and hisinnercircle.

Still, implementation will be the key.The tension between Congressand theWhite House which triggered the legisla-tion mayalso undermine itsexecution.

EverynorthEuropean countrymaintainsthatthere isarightwayto eatthe ﬁsh, butthey diﬀerasto whatitis. In Sweden Balticsur-strömmingare fermented until slightlyrancid. In Denmarkthe sill are pickled, orcooked and eaten in longstrips. In theNetherlandsharingmustbe lightlysaltedforpreservation butotherwise raw,dipped in minced onion and accompa-nied with a pickle. No food ismore loved. So the Dutch were shocked whenaccusationssurfaced in Novemberthatthere wassomethingrotten aboutthenational herringtest. The test, sponsoredbythe Algemeen Dagblad, a newspaper, iscarried outbytwo experttasters, whoeach yearrate the herringatovera hun-dred shopsand standsacrossthe country.Ben Vollaard, an economistatTilburgUniversity, wassurprised when hisrespected local ﬁshmongerscored zero.The merchanttold MrVollaard thatonejudge routinelytipped the scales, givinghigherscoresto storesthatgettheir ﬁshfrom the AtlanticGroup, a distributor inScheveningen. The judge happened to beaconsultantforAtlantic, givingcourseson howto slice and serve herring.“I sawhowmuch damage a lowratingcould do. The judgesactlike God,” saysMrVollaard, who specialisesin usingstatisticsto detectcrime. He decided torun the numbers. The ratingsincludeobjective criteria, like weightand fat-tiness, and subjective onessuch as tasteand appearance. The economistcontact-ed 85% ofthe shopssurveyed in the pasttwo yearsand asked who theirdistrib-utorswere. He found thatwhereastheoverall average score was5.5, the averageforthose supplied byAtlanticwas8.7. Theextra boostforthe Atlanticstores camemainlyfrom the subjective scores.MrVollaard’sstudyhasblown the lidoﬀthe sealed world ofDutch herring.Fishmongerswho longsuspected thejudge ofbiastowardsAtlanticnowsaythe testisrotten. Two who received lowratingshave vowed to sue the AlgemeenDagbladfordefamation.The judge and Atlanticsaytheyhavebeen smeared, and thatthe statisticalevidence isa red herring. Theysay MrVollaard’sﬁguresare oﬀ, and thattheirhigh scoresare due to theirsuperior ﬁsh.Butthe chargesofbelangenverstrengeling(conﬂictofinterest) have leftthe test’sreputation forimpartialitygutted. AMSTERDAMCan the Dutch still trusttheirherring-tasters?In a pickleRATKO MLADIC, the militaryleaderofBosnian Serb forcesduringthe war of1992-95, shouted “lies” atthe court. Never-theless, the UN’sYugoslavwar-crimestri-bunal in The Hague found him guiltyonNovember22nd ofgenocide, warcrimes,and crimesagainsthumanity. There wereno surprisesin the verdictsand no sur-prisesin the reactions. MrMladichas beensentto prison forlife; and nextmonth thetribunal will shutup shop forgood. MrMladicwasa ruddy-faced soldier’ssoldier. He did notlead from behind. Histroopsloved him. He became, and still is,an icon formanySerbs. He sawhimself asadefenderofthe Serbian nation, havingtaken up the sword asgenerationsbeforehim had done to ﬁghtforhispeople. Hesaid he wasinnocentofall charges. LikemanySerbshe wasconvinced thatthe tri-bunal wasan anti-Serb kangaroo court.MrMladicbelieved in revenge. Duringthe second world warhisfather, a commu-nistpartisan, died ﬁghtingCroatian fascistforces. Asa Yugoslavarmygeneral hehelped the Croatian Serbscarve outashort-lived secessionistenclave in Croatiain 1991. When histroopstookMuslim-heldSrebrenica in 1995 he notoriouslysaid:“The time hasﬁnallycome forrevengeagainstthe Turkswho live in thisarea.” TheTurksleftBosnia in 1878, buthe used theterm to disparage hisMuslim enemies. Inthe nextfewdaysover7,000 men and boyswere murdered in cold blood.The Hague tribunal found him guilty ofgenocide forthe murderscarried outat Sre-brenica, butnotforthose in sixother Bos-nian municipalitieswhere, although thejudgmentsaid thatwarcrimeshad takenplace, italso ruled thattheyhad fallenshortofgenocide. Thisverdictechoed thatof2016 againstRadovan Karadzic, the polit-ical leaderofthe Bosnian Serbsduring thewar. MrMladicwasalso found guiltyofterrorisingthe citizensofSarajevo duringhissiege ofthe city, and oftakingUN sol-diershostage. IfMrMladicremainsa hero to manySerbs, to those who foughthim he isthedevil incarnate. The trial will havechanged no minds. The tribunal sought tobringreconciliation to the region, but itfailed, though ithasamassed a huge ar-chive oftestimonyabouteverydetail ofthe Yugoslavwars, a vital resource for fu-ture historians.

Bosnians,Serbs, Croats, Kosovo Albaniansand oth-ersin the region live with the legacies ofpastcrimes. Butmore than revenge, theywantbetterschools, health care and jobs,like everyone else. Today’sleadershavenothingmore to do than to geton with theboringtaskofmakinglife betterfor the citi-zensofthe seven little successorstates ofthe old Yugoslavia thatMrMladicand hislike destroyed. 7WHENJohan Braven had hisﬁrstchildhe tooknine monthsofleave. For thesecond he tookten months, the sameamountashiswife. “I wasafraid ofnothavingthe bond ifI didn’tspend time athome with the children too,” saysMrBra-ven. The ﬁrstcountryin the world to allowcouplesto splitparental leave (in 1974),Sweden oﬀerseach couple 480 daysbe-tween them foreach child. Duringthe ﬁrst390 ofthose days, theyare paid atclose to80% oftheirprevioussalary—bytaxpayers.Ninetyofthose 480 daysare reserved foreach parent. The time can be taken up untilthe child iseight.Parentsin the restofEurope are farlessgenerouslytreated. In mostcountries pa-rental leave, otherthan time taken by ei-therparentasmaternityorpaternity leaveimmediatelybefore (in the case ofwomen)and afterthe birth ofa child, isunpaid, andthere isa lotlessofit; currently18 weeksperparentin Britain, forinstance. The European Commission nowwantsto bringaspectsofthe Swedish model tothe restofEurope. Negotiationsbegan atthe end ofSeptemberon a newwork-lifebalance directive, much ofwhich isaimedatoverhaulingparental leave, the latest in aseriesofattemptsithasmade to update thelaws. Underthe newdirective the length ofleave available to parents—currentlyset byEU rulesata minimum offourmonths perchild—would notchange, butitwouldhave to be paid atleastatthe same rate asacountry’sstatutorysickpay(EU rulescur-rentlymandate onlyunpaid leave, whichmanypeople choose notto take). Thesefourmonthswould be non-transferable,forcingmen to use theirparental leave orlose it. Theywould also be available to beused atanytime up until the child turns 12.Additionally, the directive plansto intro-duce a minimum ten-daypaternityleaveto be used immediatelyfollowingbirth.One aim ofthe changesisto help wom-en backto workafterhavingchildren bymakingsure theycan gettime oﬀwhentheyneed it. Acrossall memberstates thefemale employmentrate is12 percentagepointslowerthan formen: in Greece just48% ofwomen are in work, comparedwith 67% ofmen. Anotheraim isto closethe paygap. On average thisis16%, butinsome countries, such asEstonia, itis ashigh as27%. Moreover, although 32% ofworkingwomen in the EU workpart-time,only8% ofmen do. The diﬀerence isgreat-estforthose with children. Forsome, though, the bill doesnot gofarenough. MontserratMirRoca, oftheEuropean Trade Union Confederation(ETUC), saysthe group welcomesthe direc-tive, butwill “keep pushing”. “Gettingpregnantrightnowin Europe carriestheriskofendingup in a lesser-paid job,” saysBarbara Helﬀerich, an ETUC adviser. Legal-lywomen cannotbe dismissed fortakingleave butin realitytheycome backand“three weekslaterthey’re sacked ormovedto somethingelse.” Forbusinessgroupsin Brussels, how-ever, the directive isa large step too far. “Wealreadyhave a good level ofparental leavein Europe,” saysMarkusBeyrer, director-general ofBusinessEurope. “Nowisnotthe momentto add costsand burden toemployers.” The directive will notonly de-terhiringbutencourage parents, particu-larlywomen, to “keep outofthe labourmarket”, drivingup the paygap, saysMrBeyrer: “The moneywould be betterspentimprovingchild-care facilities.” Accordingto MrBeyrer, memberstateswill also takeumbrage with the EU meddlingso deeplyin social policy, especiallythose with highlevelsofsickpaylike France. Such coun-triesmaybe forced to reduce sickpay.Ata national level, a numberofreformsto parental leave are underway. In Italy thegovernmentlaunched a campaign thisyearto encourage fathersto use their enti-tlement, and in Austria a newlawcameinto force in March which rewardsparentsforsharingleave equally.Despite beingthe model forthe com-mission’sproposed reform, the Swedishsystem itselfisunderreview. “Everythingisopen to change,” saysVictorHarju, aspokesman forthe MinistryofHealth andSocial Aﬀairs. The governmentfears, cor-rectly, thatthe ruleshave made ithard forfemale migrantsto ﬁnd jobs, since compa-niesknowtheycan retroactivelyclaim pa-rental leave forall theirexistingchildren. Eastern European countriespresent aparticularproblem, saysMaryCollins ofthe Brussels-based European Women’sLobby, an umbrella group. Thisisnot onlybecause maternityleave tendsto be muchlonger, with women in Poland, forexam-ple, takingup to fouryearsoﬀ(the lastthree ofthem largelyunpaid), butalso be-cause people are a lot“more traditional”aboutgenderroles. Although women canchoose to share partofthe ﬁrstyear withtheirpartners, “mostdo not,” saysKasiaBoruta from Wroclaw, Poland. Herhus-band tookjusttwo weeksoﬀ, partlybe-cause he wason the verge ofgettinga pro-motion, butalso because “beingathomealso meansdoingthe housework,” saysMrsBoruta. “Thisisa woman’srole.” With the directive yetto passthrougheitherthe European ParliamentortheCouncil ofMinisters, itsopponentsstillhave plentyoftime to tone down some ofthe more costlyand intrusive proposals.The EU, saysMrBeyrer, should not“decreetransformation overnight”. 7Labour rulesThe SwedishexampleSTOCKHOLMThe EU plans to make parental leavemore generousMore time with the toddlersThe EconomistNovember25th2017 Europe49CROSSINGthe borderbetween Northern Ireland and hishome in the south alwaysleftthe youngGabriel D’Arcysweating.

The adamantine certaintiesofthe Brexiteeersare an ill ﬁtforthe ambiguitiesofNorthern Ireland. Talkto anyIrish oﬃcial andone assertion soon surfaces: HerMajesty’sGovernmenthasnotthoughtthisthrough. Afternearly18 monthsofrumination, itisclearthatthere isno wayto reconcile Britain’saimsofyankingthe province outofthe EU’ssingle marketand customsunion,and maintainingitsseamlessborderwith the republic, acrosswhose 300-pluscrossingpoints110m tripsare made annually. The issue ispressing. Britain planned to delaytackling the bor-derissue until the startoftrade talkswith the EUithopeswill getthe go-ahead ata summitnextmonth. Instead, Leo Varadkar, theIrish taoiseach (prime minister), and Simon Coveney, his spikyforeign minister, have threatened to veto thatifBritain failsto of-fer“tailor-made solutions” foravoidinga hard border. Suddenlythe Irish issue hasbecome the biggestobstacle in the Brexit talks.Makingmattersmore ticklish, Theresa May’sgovernmentin Lon-don ispropped up byNorthern Irish unionistshostile to anymanoeuvre thatweakenstheirlinkto the mainland. NorthernIreland itselfisin crisis, withouta governmentsince January.Ireland’smembership ofthe EU, which itjoined alongsideBritain in 1973, helped diversifythe economyawayfrom itslargerneighbour, especiallyafterthe single marketwasestablished in1993.

It also placestwo countriesthathad been enjoyinga golden age ofgood-neigh-bourlinesson opposingsidesofthe negotiatingtable and in thecross-hairsofeach other’stabloids(MrVaradkarhasbeen in-structed bythe Sun, a British red-top, to “shuthisgob...and growup”).

North-south institutions gov-ern mattersofjointconcern, from food safetyto waterways. Theagreement’s“consentprinciple” givesthe north’srepublicansapath to reunion with Ireland, should theywin majoritysupportforit. And withoutcheckpoints, borderregionshave found thatcommerce, in MrCoveney’swords, can be “a greathealer”. Todaythe councilsofDerry-Strabane (in the north) and Donegal (acrossthe border) exploitthe common regulatoryspace thatEU mem-bership providesto marketthemselvesto investorsasthe singleeconomicunitof“Ireland North-West”.

Vanguard’smanagementopposed themotion, arguingagainstprescriptive con-straintson a fund’sinvestible universe—es-peciallyindexfunds, which are mandatedto purchase sharesin everycompanythatmakesup an index.

He thenled a campaign to encourage local farmersto adopthisnovelties—which theydid.Varietyis life itselfDrMwanga isnowworkingon virusresis-tance, forviral infection isa bigproblemwith sweetpotatoes.

Farmershave then to be en-couraged to adoptthem. And farmersare,forunderstandable reasons, resistant tochange. Thattheycan be induced to do so,though, isshown byDrMwanga’sexperi-ence. Unlike traditional African sweet-po-tato landraces, which are white, hisim-proved varietiesare orange because theycontain beta-carotene, a molecule which isaprecursorto vitamin A. To startwith,manyofUganda’ssweet-potato farmersrejected the newcultivarsforhuman con-sumption, thinkingthem good onlyfor useasanimal fodder. Bypatientpersuasion, DrMwanga won them round. Recruitingseedcompaniesisalso important. In Uganda,DrMwanga isworkingwith two localﬁrms, BioCropsand Senai, to distribute thelatestvarietiesoforange sweetpotato. Atthe moment, the focusofall this ac-tivityisverymuch on improvingsubsis-tence agriculture. But, asDrOselebe’sworksuggests, the potential forsomething muchbiggerdoesexist.

Thethinnerthislayer, the more eﬃciently theanimal in question hasbeen digesting anyfatsithaseaten. Since mostcarotenoids arebound to fattymoleculescalled lipo-proteins, DrSepp reasoned thatthose birdswhich the testsuggestsare collecting fatseﬃcientlyfrom theirfood will also bebrightlycoloured.To investigate thisidea, she and hercol-leaguescollected 36 male house ﬁnches—birdsknown forhavingbrilliantredbreasts.

In thiscontext, a recentattempted repli-cation isimportant, foritactuallywas pub-lished lastweekin a journal called Psycho-logical Science. ItsauthorwasMichaelDufnerofthe UniversityofLeipzig, in Ger-many. In it, he said thathe wasunable toreplicate a fascinatingpreviousﬁndingwhich had suggested thatpeople whosmile more intenselytend to live longerthan those who did not. The original study, published in 2010 byErnestAbel and Michael Kruger, then ofWayne State University, in Detroit, seemedsound enough. The two researchershadgathered the mugshotsof196 playersfromthe Baseball Registerof1952, which liststhegame’sprofessionalsin a given year, andasked a team ofvolunteerswho wereblind to the purpose ofthe experiment tostudythe players’ smilesand rate their in-tensity. DrAbel and MrKrugerthen delvedinto ﬁlesthatcontained information onwhen the playersin theirexperimenthaddied—orif, byrare chance, theywere stillalive. Thisanalysisrevealed thatplayerswith full smileswere more likelyto havelived to a ripe old age than those who hadpartial smilesorno smilesatall. Statistically, thiswasa strongresult. Theprobabilitythatitwasthe resultof chancewasone in 50. Itwasalso an intriguing re-sult. Itdovetailed well with ideasthenemergingthathappinessinducesbiologi-cal eﬀectswhich lead to improved health.Indeed, DrDufneroften discussed the re-search with othersand, asquestionsaboutwhetherthe workhad everbeen replicatedcame with increasingfrequency, he decid-ed to roll up hissleevesand do so in hisown laboratory. Togetherwith a team ofcolleagues, heworked with a sample based on the oneused in the original study. All ofthe playersin thatwere included, alongwith a larger,non-overlappingsetof527 Baseball-Regis-terimagesofplayerswho were activeslightlybefore, orafter, 1952. Justlike the re-searchersin the ﬁrstexperiment, DrDufnerrelied on “blind” volunteersto ratethe intensityofthe smilesin the images. Ofthe pictureshe worked with, 40% showedno smile, 42% showed a partial smile and18% showed a full smile.When DrDufnercompared these num-berswith howlongeach ofthe playerslived, however, he found no correlation be-tween lifespan and smile intensityin ei-therthe original orthe expanded samplesofplayers. When replicationsfail in thisway, particularlyin ﬁeldslike psychology,criticsoften argue that“hidden modera-tors” like diﬀerencesin time, culture orsample composition between the originalstudyand the replicate are the reason forthe failure. Whatisnotable aboutDrDufner’sworkisthatitdid notcontain anysuch factors. The photoswere the same.Onlythe volunteerexaminerswere diﬀer-ent. Somehow, itseemed, the two sets hadcoded the players’ smilesdiﬀerentlyand inthe earlierstudythe chance resulthadcome to pass, asone time in 50 itmust.To checkin detail whathad happenedDrDufnercontacted DrAbel, the paper’sseniorauthor, and asked ifhe could see theoriginal data. Unfortunately, these wereunavailable. AsDrAbel explained to TheEconomist, he hasnowretired and whenhe did so he “threwoutmydata forthe past40 years.

Thismakesthebreakerboxan ideal place from which tomanage energyuse. To make such managementwork,though, the breakersneed to become“smart”. One wayto do thatisto add elec-tronicsto them. ThisiswhatEaton, a multi-national, isattemptingin a trial takingplace in America with a dozen utilities andthe ElectricPowerResearch Institute, an in-dustrybody. Eaton’smodiﬁed breakershave been installed in about80 buildings,where theyare monitoringand controllingpowersuppliesremotely. The breakers,which use encrypted internetconnections,can also metereach circuitseparately. Thatpermitsa much broaderanalysisto bemade ofa building’spowerconsumptionand mightin the future allowutilities to of-ferdiﬀerenttariﬀsforcircuitspowering dif-ferentthings, saysRon Thompson, one ofthe project’sleaders. Asecond phase of thetrial will begin nextyear, to develop moreapplications. So far, the mostpopular onescontrol heating, airconditioning, waterheatersand rechargingelectriccars.ManetosLabs, a Swedish ﬁrm, isgoingeven furtherthan this, bydeveloping a dig-ital circuit-breaker. Thathasbeen madepossible byadvancesin high-powersemi-conductors, which allow“solid-state” cir-cuitbreakers, with no movingparts, to bebuilt. These would actasdirectreplace-mentsforelectromechanical ones. BreakerdancingAdigital breakerhasseveral advantages. Itslackofmechanical partsshould make itboth saferand more reliable. Itcan cut a cir-cuitin just250 nanoseconds, which issub-stantiallyfasterthan a mechanical version,saysTrued Holmquist, a Swedish informa-tion-technologyentrepreneurwho helpedfound Manetos. The programsitusestocontrol, measure and communicate withappliancescould be updated overthe in-ternet, lettingnewfeaturesbe added astheyare developed. And, aswith mostsmart-energyservices, these could be con-trolled bya smartphone app. The level ofdetail smartbreakers lookatisimpressive. MrHolmquistsaysthat hiscan, forexample, measure the revolutions-per-minute ofthe compressorin a refriger-ator. Notonlywould thisletan app moni-torhowhard the appliance isworking, itcould also give warningifthatappliancewasaboutto breakdown.Auseful innovation, then, butone onlylikelyto be taken up ifthe price is right. Tothisend Manetoshasteamed up with Flex,an American ﬁrm thatisone ofthe world’slargestcontractmanufacturers, to work outhowto make solid-state breakersascheap-lyaspossible. The plan isto consolidatethe electroniccircuitsinto a single chip thatcan be mass-produced fora fewdollars.Breakersusingsuch chipsshould, MrHolmquistreckons, be competitive withmechanical ones. Otherﬁrmsare takinga diﬀerent ap-proach to the question ofprice, byseekingcustomerswillingto paya premium for asolid-state breaker’svirtues. Atom Power,in North Carolina, isaimingthe digitalbreakersitisdevelopingatcommercialand industrial buildings, where itthinkstheirbeneﬁtswill be higherthan in homes. One ofthe advantagesofa solid-statebreakeristhatitremovesthe riskof arcﬂashes—electrical dischargesthatcan runthrough the airwhen a switch isthrown.Such sparksare particularlyhazardous ifthere are combustible materialsaround,which ismore likelyin an industrial than adomesticsetting. Siemens, a German electricalsgiant,reckonsdigital breakersshow“greatpro-mise” and hastaken a stake in the com-pany. Atom’sengineershave notgiven upon the domesticmarket, though. Theyhope residential versionswill be practicalonce production volumesgrow. Eaton alsothinksthat, atsome point, the time for digi-tal breakerswill come.There is, however, one otherobstaclebesidesprice to the uptake ofdomestic dig-ital breakers: the regulators. These people,naturallyand sensiblyconservative, tendto be more in tune with mechanical thandigital breakersystems. Theircertiﬁcationisnecessarybefore productscan go onsale.

In 1773, when the Britishgovernmenttried to putsmugglersout ofbusinessbyslashingthe oﬃcial duty ontea, the Boston Tea Partyprotestsfollowed,leadingto an embargo and, ultimately, awarofindependence.Afterthe American constitution gaveauthorityon trade mattersto Congress, thestage wassetforcenturiesofwrangling.On the surface, tariﬀsdid seem boring.Speciﬁcdutiesforitemslike molasses, saltand nailswere motivated bythe need fortaxrevenue; between 1790 and 1860 tariﬀsaccounted for90% ofthe federal taxtake.Butbeneath the tangle ofbureaucracy, big-gerdebatesraged.

With the restofthe world economyin disarray, foreign producersposed littlecompetitive threat, though thatchangedoverthe followingdecadesasJapan andEurope regained strength.AsMrIrwin spinsthisgrand narrative,he also debunkstrade-policymyths. Dur-ingrecessions, tariﬀshave often been as-signed more ofa role than theyreally had,lowonesforinﬂictingAmerican producerswith excessive competition (asin 1818) andhigh onesforstimulatingdomesticproduc-tion (asin 1893). Buttariﬀchangeswere of-ten too small ortoo late to have these pur-ported results; monetarypolicyand otherfactorsare more often to blame.Political dynamicswould lead peopleto see a linkbetween tariﬀsand the eco-nomiccycle thatwasnotthere. Aboomwould generate enough revenue fortariﬀsto fall, and when the bustcame pressurewould build to raise them again. Bythetime thathappened, the economywouldbe recovering, givingthe impression thattariﬀcutscaused the crash and the reversegenerated the recovery.MrIrwin also methodicallydebunksthe idea thatprotectionism made Americaagreatindustrial power, a notion believedbysome to oﬀerlessonsfordevelopingcountriestoday. Asitsshare ofglobalmanufacturingpowered from 23% in 1870to 36% in 1913, the admittedlyhigh tariﬀs ofthe time came with a cost, estimated ataround 0.5% ofGDPin the mid-1870s.

Before the civil war, Southern ex-porters—theircotton competitive in globalmarketsbecause oftheirslave labour—de-spised tariﬀs, whereasimport-competingindustriesin the North enjoyed the protec-tion.

Bothreconﬁgurationswere triggered bycata-strophicevents. The civil warled to a newpolitical balance, awayfrom the southern-erswho favoured free trade. And asfederalspendingsoared afterthe war, more taxrevenue wasneeded. Special-interestgroupsorganised to cheertheirprotec-tions, includingpeople like JamesSwank,founderofthe American Iron and Steel As-sociation, who wrote that“protection inthiscountryisonlyanothername for Patri-otism.” (He wasnotthe lastofhiskind.)

The Depres-sion waswell underwaybefore itcameinto force. The tariﬀchangesthemselvesplayed lessofa role than deﬂation; be-cause the tariﬀswere setin dollarterms,theyloomed largeraspricesand wagesfell. And the collapse ofglobal trade hadmore to do with widespread capital con-trolsthan a tit-for-tattariﬀrace.Readersmaywonderwhether700pagesofdebunking—some ofthem a slog—are worth it. ButMrIrwin doesthink thattrade policieshave consequences, just notthe onesusuallytrumpeted. Such policiestransferwealth, sometimesbysizeableamounts. In 1885 an average tariﬀof30% re-shuﬄed around 9% ofAmerica’sGDPfromforeign exportersand domesticimportersto domesticproducersand the govern-ment. Trade policiesalso generate costs. In1984, economistsfound thatconsumerswere forkingoutmore than $100,000 inthe form ofhigherpricesforeach job pro-tected in the clothingindustry, where theaverage wage wasaround $12,000 peryear.The otherreason to persistwith Mr Ir-win’stome isforprotection againstthefoesoftrade who have populated Ameri-ca’shistoryand are in theirpomp again. In1824, HenryClay, one ofAmerica’sgreatsenators, proposed an “American system”oftariﬀs, a national bankand “internal im-provements” like roadsand canalstostrengthen the economyofthe youngcountry. He sawtariﬀsasa no-lose deal:raisingmoneyfrom foreigners, promotingAmerican industryand creatinga bal-anced, self-suﬃcienteconomy.

Openinghisbookwith ques-tionslike these, ThomasVoigt, a journalist,ﬁlm-makerand voice coach, seeksto ex-plain the cultofJonasKaufmann, beforeaskingwhatmakeshim tick.Born and broughtup in Munich, thisGerman tenorhasmade a smooth ascent.Inducted into the mysteriesofWagner byhismusic-lovinggrandfather, he gravitatedto musicvia school choirand workas ateenage extra in staged operettas. Operaticbitpartsand trainingwith ﬁrst-class tutorsin musiccollege led to a grindinglytoughspell in the state theatre ofSaarbrücken,where he wascalled on to singall tenorroleswhile also studyingballetand fenc-ing. When hisvoice suddenlydried up inthe middle of“Parsifal” he thoughtofgiv-ingitall up. Nowhe knowswhythathap-pened: tryingto produce the “Germansound”, he had notlethisvoice ﬂow freely.Much ofthisbookisaboutthatvoice,and whatmakesitso special. Ithasa dark,burnished, almostbaritonal timbre and,when required, a “heroicgleam” on itstopnotes. MrKaufmann’sbreath-control isphenomenal, and hispianissimo singing isso beautifullyfocused thatitcarries eﬀort-lesslyto the gods. Add to thisa probing in-telligence and a magneticstage presence,and itiseasyto see whythe NewYork Met,La Scala and CoventGarden could notgetenough ofhim afterhe moved into theworld’stop-tenorslot, when thatwas va-cated bya seeminglyburnt-outRolandoVillazón. MrKaufmann goesinto detail onthe physical demandsofhisart, which hedescribesasa competitive sport; he speakseloquentlyofthe fearto which all singersare prone when illnessstrikes.MrVoigtinvitesdirectors, conductorsand othersingersto join in thisconversa-tion, sometimeswith piquantresults. Sit-tingbeside MrKaufmann, Anja Harteros, aGerman soprano, gleefullyholdsforth onthe onstage eroticcharge which their duetin “Don Giovanni” generates, promptinghim to replythat“singingrequiresa certainexhibitionism, because experienceslikethese are normallyenjoyed bycouples inthe privacyoftheirown homes.” Butthisbookcomeswith a caveat. Itispromoted as“revealing”, and MrVoigt’sjournalisticcredentialsare impeccable.Butafterthe ﬁrstedition appeared in 2010,MrVoigtbecame MrKaufmann’spressof-ﬁcer. The updated German edition of2015,ofwhich thisisa translation, omits any-thingremotelyuncomfortable. Regardingthe reasonsthe singerseparated from hiswife (and in eﬀecthisdevoted manager) in2014, MrVoigtwritesapprovinglythat“with fewexceptionstheirdesire forpri-vacyhasbeen respected.” MrVoigt’sques-tionsgetsofterand more fanzine-ish asthebookproceeds, with the worstthatanyonesaysaboutMrKaufmann beingthathe istoo keen to collude with the PRindustry.An armyoffanswill ensure thatthis bookbecomesa bestseller, butthe real biogra-phyisyetto be written.7Jonas KaufmannAvoice forthegodsIn Conversation with Jonas Kaufmann.ByThomas Voigt.

Theyneed to getoutoftheirgilded ghettosand visit BrexitBritain. Theyalso need to getoutof theirmental ghetto and startrethinkingpublicpolicy. MrPeston presentsa longlist ofpo-tential reforms: reducingthe powerof theTreasury, an organisation thatisboth “toobigforitsbootsand too powerful for thecountry’sneeds”; establishingregionalbanksthatcan adapttheirinterestrates forlocal circumstances; puttingthe joi de vivrebackinto an educational system thathasbeen immiserated byrote learningand ac-ademictargets.

And hisconviction that“outofthecurrentswamp, a newgeneration ofpoliti-cianswith credible newideaswill emergeprimped and pristine on the shoreline ofourageingdemocracies” looksdelusional.There islittle evidence thatBritain’selitesare prepared to use Brexitasa spurto think-ingup brightnewpolicies.

ﬁveyears. Countries with booming middle-class populations account for most ofthis: premiums in China will rise by 23%this year. In America, the world’s largestmarket, premiums will fall by 2%. A fall inannuity sales helps explain the drop,owing to uncertainty about the impact ofanew ﬁduciary rule that requires ﬁ-nancial advisers to put clients’ interestsﬁrst. Proﬁts in the life-insurance industryhave been dragged down by low interestrates.

He puton no airs. Lived byhis owntruth. And since histruth told him that hewasGod, and love, and lived in every-thing, then so he was, and so he did. All thatmade him sound like a hippie, aword he hated, and in the late 1960shemighthave been dismissed asjustonemore long-haired wild-eyed weirdo with aband ofgroupie women driftinground thedesertsofsouthern California, living onweed and free love. Thatwasbefore, on thenightofAugust9th 1969, ﬁve people and analmost-at-term babywere killed atBene-dictCanyon in LosAngeles. One ofthemwasSharon Tate, a famousactress. On thenextnighta grocery-chain owner, Leno La-Bianca, and hiswife were butchered todeath in the same way. The killingsterri-ﬁed Hollywood, horriﬁed America, andthe trail eventuallyled to him. He denied it. Athistrial in 1970, alongwith three dizzyfollowers, he wenton liv-ingbyhisown code. He came in barefoot,lunged atthe judge, carved an “X” into hisforehead, punched hislawyer. He did a lotofstaringatthe juryand the spectators, un-til theylooked away. The cosseted richworld ofthe murdervictimswasnothiscircle. He had nothingto do with them, noresponsibilityforthem. So whyshould hecare? Whatthe hell did “care” mean?He had made himselfscarce while thekillingswere done. Sometimeshe deniedhe had even suggested them. Ifhisfollow-ersthoughtitwasrightto shoot, stab andhangthese people, then itwasright. Hewalked the line with them. Theygottheirhandsdirty. He approved ofthe waytheyhad scrawled “PIGS” in blood on the walls.Pigsasin thatBeatlessonghe liked, Everywhere there’slotsofpiggiesLivingpiggylives.He had told them, ifyou’re goingto dosomething, then leave somethingwitchy.Justa sign to letthe world knowyou werethere. Have a good day. Thiswaswar, anyway. The killingswere meantto be blamed on BlackPan-thers, the ﬁrststrikesin a clash of racesthatwould engulfAmerica. He called this“Hel-terSkelter”, asin anotherBeatlessong, When I getto the bottom,Igo backto the top ofthe slide.All the whiteswould be killed, except forhim and hisfollowers. Then, when theblacksfound theycouldn’tgovern, theywould call on him. He would send thembackto pickingcotton and become thekingofthe world. Thatwaswhyhe went tothe desert, to digthatbottomlesspit fromRevelation Chapter9, to hide outwhile thewarwenton. And also because he wasspirituallyallied with the scorpion and thewolf. In San Quentin laterhe made scorpi-onsoutofthread pulled from hissocks. Hobo, bum, kingHe knewno real home butthe penitentia-ry. Hismotherwasan unwed little run-awayfrom the hillsofKentucky, whodidn’twanthim. Childhood waspoverty,baloneyforSundaydinner, pettythievingand reform schools. He setthem on ﬁreand ran away. Forginga $43 cheque gothimaprison sentence often yearsin 1960. Butjail wasschool aswell ashome. Give him adarksolitarycell and there wasa universein there, where he wasfree. He learnedsteel guitarand looked atScientology; heread Dale Carnegie’s“Howto Win Friendsand Inﬂuence People”. Positive thinkingimpressed the driftermiddle-classgirls hemetin Haight-Ashburywhen he gotre-leased, in 1967. And the girlswere bait todrawin men. Soon he had a familyofa shifting dozenorso. He didn’tcall itone himself, but itwasthe closestthinghe’d known, and hewasin control ofit. Hisfollowers’ mindswere wiped clean ofsociety’scorruptionto see the world hisway. Often he’d puthispalmsto theirsand make them move as hedid. Then he’d jump about, grimace, laughwildly, and theywould do the same. Thesewere survival techniqueshe had alsopicked up in jail, in a hundred life-death sit-uations. Be whateveritsuitsyouto be atthe time. Be brand new, disconcertpeople.Be zero, a nobody, be a god. Hobo, bum,tramp, king. And a straightrazor, if anyonegottoo close.The world had to notice him. He hopedto bend itto hiswill through music. Secretmessagesaboutthe Apocalypse camethrough rocksongs, and he had plenty tosend. He had useful contactswith theBeach Boys, sentfan-telegramsto the Beat-les. One producerwho didn’tgive him a re-cordingcontractwaskilled, the ﬁrst death.He thoughtofthe Tate house because an-otherproducerwho had failed him livedthere, buthe had moved away. So hismes-sage gotoutin diﬀerentblood. The albumhe ﬁnallycutin 1970 wascalled “LIE”.Then, on seven countsofmurder, he wasbackin hisusual home. Forlife. Fine.He cared nothingforwhatpeoplethoughtofhim. Theyhad theirtruth, hehad his. Iftheymade him a monster, oridolised him on T-shirts, thatwastheir pro-blem. Iftheysawhim asevil incarnate,thatwasjusta reﬂection ofthe evil in theirown minds. In hisown world he nevermade a bad move, wasneverbeaten, al-wayschanging. He waslife, and he wasthere, readyto lunge, inside everyone. 7Everyone and nobodyCharles Manson, serial killer, died on November19th, aged 83ObituaryCharles Mansonlouisvuitton.comYour journey, connected.Tambour Horizon
