At the same time, the boom in electronic and mobile commerce has increased air-freight volumes as consumers order goods across borders, demanding speedy delivery.This has proven a boon for the aerospace industry. Globally, in the next two decades, more than 41,000 aircraft are expected to be produced, with a value of over $6.1 trillion. This bounty will ﬂ ow not only to plane manufacturers but also to a range of supporting parts and service suppliers.By implementing its Aerospace Industry Blueprint 2030, Malaysia is committed to growing the local industry, which recorded total revenue of $2.9 billion in 2016 as exports increased by 3.2% to $1.3 billion. Due to Malaysia’s conducive business environment, the more than 80 aerospace companies operating there include international players such as GE Engine Services Malaysia, Airbus and Spirit AeroSystems, along with local ﬁ rms like SME Aerospace, CTRM Aero Composites and UMW Aerospace.Kansas-based Spirit AeroSystems is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aerostructures. Since setting up in Malaysia, it has developed a talent pipeline to help meet increasing demand for highly skilled aerospace workers. It expects staff numbers to grow to 1,000 within the next three years, and has created 2,700 more jobs at local suppliers of fabrication, tooling and jigs, machining, logistics and consumables.The strength of this supply chain is a huge draw for foreign aerospace companies. “Malaysia established a strong foundation to promote the aerospace industry’s growth with incentives and schemes,” says Scott McLarty, vice-president of Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia. “The government worked hand in hand with the industry and provided a platform by making available resources in engineering, skilled technicians and programmes to establish new suppliers.”One of the many local companies to beneﬁ t from the presence of large global ﬁ rms is UMW Aerospace. Being the ﬁ rst Asian business to manufacture fan cases for Rolls Royce is helping it develop capability in precision hard metal machining. “Aerospace helps transition UMW Group into high-value manufacturing,” says Megat Shahrul Azmir, president of UMW’s manufacturing and engineering division. “We [now] have a very niche capability which allows us to diversify into other industries.”“Aerospace helps transition UMW Group into high-value manufacturing,” says Megat Shahrul Azmir, president of UMW’s manufacturing and engineering division. “We [now] have a very niche capability which allows us to diversify into other industries.” “The government worked hand in hand with the industry and provided a platform by making available resources in engineering, skilled technicians and programmes to establish new suppliers,” says Scott McLarty, vice-president of Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia. The world’s new and emerging leaders in the aerospace industry are already making Malaysia their hub from which to embrace the abundant business opportunities in The EconomistSeptember30th201791Saudi Arabiaannounced thatitwould allowwomen todrive.

Atthestartofthisyear, the an-swerwasobvious. Angela Mer-kel wastrundlingunstoppablytowardsa fourth election win,while Britain wasout, Italydown and stagnatingFrancegripped bythe fearthatMarineLe Pen mightbecome the GallicDonald Trump.Thisweek, itall looksverydiﬀerent. MrsMerkel won herelection on September24th, butwith such a reduced tally ofvotesand seatsthatshe isa diminished ﬁgure (see page 47).Germanyfacesmonthsoftrickythree-waycoalition talks.Some 6m votersbacked a xenophobicright-wingparty, manyofthem in protestatMrsMerkel’srefugee policies. Havinghadno seats, Alternative forGermany, a disruptive and polarisingforce, isnowthe Bundestag’sthird largestparty.Yetwestofthe Rhine, with a parliamentdominated by hisown new-minted and devoted party, France’sPresidentEm-manuel Macron isburstingwith ambition (see ourspecial re-portin thisissue). Thisweekhe used a speech about the Euro-pean Union to stake hisclaim to the limelight. Whether MrMacron can restore France to centre-stage in the EUaftera de-cade in the chorusdependsnotjuston hisplansforEurope, butalso on hissuccessathome, reforminga countrylong seen asunreformable.Angela’s leading manStartwith Europe. Thisweek’sspeech wasbrimmingoverwith ideas, includinga shared militarybudgetand an agencyfor“radical innovation”, aswell asthe desire to strengthen theeuro zone. Atone level, MrMacron’sbid forthe role ofintellec-tual innovatorin Europe ﬁtsa longFrench tradition. Moreover,elementsofhisspeech—a newcarbon-taxon the EU’sfron-tiers, a proposal to taxforeign tech ﬁrmswhere they makemoneyratherthan where theyare registered, a crusade against“social dumping” with harmonised corporate taxrates—werein keepingwith long-standingFrench attemptsto stop mem-berstatescompeting“disloyally” againsteach other.YetMrMacron hasa more subtle and radical goal than old-style dirigisme; asifto prove it, he agreed thisweekthat Al-stom, which makeshigh-speed trains, could driftfrom state in-ﬂuence bymergingwith itsprivate-sectorGerman rival. Hisaim isto see oﬀpopulism bystrikinga balance between pro-vidingjob securityforcitizens, on the one hand, and encourag-ingthem to embrace innovation, which manyfearwill costthem theirjobs, on the other(see Charlemagne). In his speechMrMacron also made the case fordigital disruption and thecompletion ofthe digital single market. Euro-zone reformwould make Europe lessvulnerable to the nextﬁnancial crisis.The meritofthese ideasdependson whethertheylead to amore enterprising, open and conﬁdentEurope orto a protec-tionistfortress. Buttheymaynotbe tried outatall unlessMrMacron can make a successofhispoliciesathome. For, ifFrance remainsa threatto the EU’seconomicstabilityratherthan a source ofitsstrength, itspresidentcan never be morethan a bitplayernextto Germany’schancellor.MrMacron’sdomesticpolicymightseem to have made apoorstart. He hasgrabbed headlinesthanksto the size ofhismake-up bill, the collapse ofhispopularityand the whiﬀ ofar-rogance abouthis“Jupiterian” approach to power. Predictably,the grouchyFrench are alreadycontestingthe legitimacy oftheplanstheyelected MrMacron to carryout. Reform in France, itseems, followsa pattern. The streetobjects; the governmentbacksdown; immobilisme setsin.Yettake a closerlook, and MrMacron maybe aboutto breakthe pattern. Somethingextraordinary, iflittle-noticed, tookplace thissummer. While mostofthe French were on thebeach, MrMacron negotiated and agreed with unionsa far-reaching, liberalisinglabourreform which he signed into lawon September22nd—all with minimal fuss. NeitherFrance’smilitantunions, noritsﬁeryfarleft, have so fardrawn the masssupporttheyhad hoped foronto the streets. Fully59% oftheFrench saythattheybacklabourreform. More protests will fol-low. Harderbattles, overpensions, taxation, publicspendingand education, lie ahead. MrMacron needsto keep his nerve,but, astonishingly, he hasalreadypassed hisﬁrstbig test. In manyways, the 39-year-old MrMacron isnotyetwell un-derstood. Behind the haughtyexterior, a leaderisemergingwho seemsto be atonce brave, disciplined and thoughtful.Brave, because labourreforms, asGermanyand Spain know,take time to translate into job creation, and usually hand politi-cal rewardsto the successorsofthose who do the thanklessworkofgettingthem through. Disciplined, because he laid outclearlybefore hiselection whathe planned to do, and hasstuckto hisword. The unionswere fullyconsulted, and two ofthe three biggestaccepted the reform. Compare thatwith hispredecessor, FrançoisHollande, who tried reform bystealthand encountered onlyaccusationsofbad faith. Last, thought-ful: MrMacron doesnotapproach policyasan à la cartemenu.He hasgrasped howdigital technologyisdislocatingthe worldofwork. Hisgoverningphilosophyisto adaptFrance’soutdat-ed system ofrulesand protectionsaccordingly. DrumrollOverthe pastfewyears, an enfeebled France hasbeen a chron-icallyweakpartnerforGermany, pushingMrsMerkel into asolo role thatshe neithersoughtnorrelished. Ifhe isto changethatdynamic, MrMacron needsto move swiftlyto match hislabourlawwith an overhaul ofFrance’sineﬃcienttrainingbudget, increase the numberofapprenticeshipsand renovatethe state’ssleepyemploymentservices. He also needsto ex-plain with a lesscontemptuoustone whyhisplansfor taxcuts,includingto France’swealth taxand corporate tax, are not de-signed simplyto beneﬁtbusinessand the better-oﬀ. In Europehe needsto reassure the northern, more open economies thathe isnottryingto putup walls.Ofcourse, MrMacron’sﬁrststepsin the spotlightmay falter.The oddson anyleaderreformingFrance are neverhigh. Hewill struggle to convince Germanyto embrace hisvision ofeuro-zone reform.

Often theyre-sorted to strange excuses. Somesaid women were too stupid todrive. Some worried thatmaledriversmightbe dangerouslydistracted byfemale ones, orthatmobilitywould make iteasierforwivesto commit adul-tery. One suggested thatdrivingdamagesthe ovaries. Nonewasable to cite a verse in the Koran to justifybarring womenfrom the wheel, because there isn’tone. On the contrary, re-formersnote, in the earlydaysofthe faith women rode don-keys, unsupervised, withoutbringingdeath and destruction. So the kingdom’sdecision on September26th to liftthe banisaswelcome asitisoverdue. Itwill give Saudi women a free-dom thatotherstake forgranted. Itwill have economic bene-ﬁts, too, sparingfamiliesthe costofhiringa (male) driverandmakingiteasierforwomen to getoutofthe house and into thelabourmarket. ItmakesSaudi Arabia a bitlessdismally excep-tional; no othercountrybanswomen drivers, unlessyoucountthe non-country, IslamicState. Yetitisonlya start. The kingdom haslongbeen ruled bya pactbetween the AlSaud rulingfamilyand Wahhabi clericswho impose their ul-tra-strictinterpretation ofIslamiclaw. In partits puritanismwasa response to a double shockin 1979, the Islamicrevolu-tion in mainlyShia Iran and the siege ofthe GreatMosque inMecca bySunni extremists. In private, Saudi royalsoften es-pouse more liberal views, buttheyhave alwaysfeared upset-tingtheiralliance with the clerics.The crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman (orMBS, ashe iscalled), isa boldersortofroyal. Hisfather, KingSalman, hasgiven him control overmostthings, includingthe economyand defence policy. MBS, in turn, hasdrawn up an ambitiousreform programme to diversifythe countryawayfrom oil andwean Saudisoﬀdo-little governmentjobsbyenergising theprivate sector. Tappingthe kingdom’sgreatestunderused re-source—itswomen—isan obviousplace to begin. More wom-en attend Saudi universitiesthan men, buttheymake up just15% ofthe workforce. Come June, when the ban isoﬃcially lift-ed, theywill be able to drive themselvesto work.MBShaschipped awayatthe wilaya(guardianship) sys-tem, which putswomen underthe thumb ofmale relatives,and curbed the religiouspolice, who used to hound youngSaudisforsuch oﬀencesaswearingnail polish.Publiccon-certs, previouslybanned, started thisyear. There is even talkofopeningcinemasforthe ﬁrsttime since the 1980s. Saudisareamongthe mostdigitallyconnected people in the world. MBSisrightto sense thattheywantmore freedom. Hisnext stepsshould be to abolish the wilaya system entirelyand curb theinﬂuence thatWahhabi clericsexercise overSaudi schools andsocial policy. Wahhabism, afterall, isone ofthe ideological pil-larsofglobal jihadism.The headstrong princeThe ﬂipside ofMBS’sboldnessishispropensityto actrashly.He haspursued a cruel warin Yemen and led a diplomatic as-saulton Qatar, with little to showforeither. The lifting oftheban on women driversseemstimed to distractattention fromthe recentsuppression ofdissentathome. The dissidents hisregime haslocked up include reformersand even clerics whoargued forliftingthe drivingban. Social liberalisation isbeingpursued byilliberal means, and incoherently. Itishard to en-visage MBSsucceedingin hisambitiousplansbyroyal decree.He needsto garnermore consent. To obtain it, he must learn totolerate debate and disagreement. Eventuallyhe should movetowardssome form ofdemocraticconsultation. 7Opening up Saudi ArabiaDrivingreformAtlastSaudi women will be allowed to drive.

The mostpervasiveform ofdiscrimination isopac-ity: itisnearlyimpossible, say,foran average investorto knowhowmuch ofthe money in hispension potislostin transaction costs. Aswell ashelping insti-tutionsmilktheirclients, opaque marketscan cause or exacer-bate criseswhen investorsﬂee riskstheycannotassess; wit-nessthe fate ofmortgage-backed securitiesin 2007-08. So itiswelcome thatmuch post-crisisﬁnancial regulation aims tomake marketsmore transparent. Thatwastrue both oftheDodd-Frankreformsin America and a huge newlawin theEuropean Union. Aswith Dodd-Frank, however, the beneﬁtsofEurope’sreform riskbeingdrowned in itscomplexity.The Marketsin Financial InstrumentsDirective (MiFID2),which comesinto force in January, isa child ofthe crisis, and isatleastasbroad and ambitiousasDodd-Frank. Itrecasts a lawfrom 2007 governingshare tradingand isthe lateststage in theEU’slongprojectto harmonise ﬁnancial marketswithin itsborders—thistime coveringbonds, derivativesand other in-strumentsaswell asequities. Tradingin bondsand derivativesisatpresentlargely con-ducted “overthe counter” (oﬀcentralised exchanges). The newlawpushesittowardselectronic-tradingvenues, and requiresmuch greaterprice transparency. In the same vein, it restrictstradingofsharesin “darkpools” (private exchangesclosed tothe retail investor). The resultshould be thatmiddlemen passmore ofthe beneﬁtsto theircustomers. Similarly, investmentbankswill be required to “unbundle” the costoftheirresearchnotes. Fund managerswill have to payforthem separately,ratherthan burythem in othercommissionsand fees. Laudable asthe law’saimsare, itsimplementation is prov-inga nightmare asthe deadline drawsnear(see page 65). Theﬁnancial industry, forall itspredictable grumbling, haspartlyitselfto blame forleavingpreparationstoo late. But regulatorsare atfault, too. Some EUcountrieshave notyetﬁnalised theirinterpretation ofthe rules(despite Britain’simpendingBrexit,itsregulatorisin factthe bestprepared).

He still promisesto curb the unsustainable pen-sion system, to open sheltered industriesto competition, tomake iteasierto dismisssalaried employees, and so on. Andthere have been plausible reasonsfordelay. Both politicallyand economically, itmade sense to waituntil a recovery wasunderwaybefore administeringunpleasantmedicine.Abe’s bad habitsButpoliticsnowappearsto be compoundingMrAbe’stimid-ity. He called the election more than a yearahead of schedule,presumablyon the assumption thathisprospectswere notlikelyto improve overthe next14 months. One concern istheformation ofthe PartyofHope, led bythe governorof Tokyoand recentdefectorfrom the LDP, Yuriko Koike. The newpartywill subsume the Tokyo-based one she led to a resounding vic-toryoverthe LDPin local electionsearlierthisyear. It isin eﬀectabsorbingthe partythatcurrentlyservesasthe main opposi-tion, the Democrats, therebyunitingMrAbe’schiefadversar-ies(see page 25). Asitwas, MrAbe hardlyseemed to be preparingvoters forunpopulareconomicreforms. He hasbeen talkingabout theeconomyon the stump, butonlyto promise extra spending onvariousthings, includingpensions. He readilyadmits thathe ismore interested in amendingthe paciﬁstconstitution than inmendingthe economy, and thatstructural reform issimply ameansto restore Japan to greatness.The election maymake thingsworse, ifitendsup sappingMrAbe’sauthority, and with ithisenthusiasm forreform. Atthe veryleast, the LDPseemslikelyto lose a fewseats, simplybecause itscurrentmajorityisso big. Ifthe losses are biggerthan expected, ambitiousunderlingsin the LDPmaytrytoejectMrAbe asleaderofthe party.Buthoweverbigthe LDP’smajority, and whoeverendsupin charge, itwould be a grave mistake to leave the job ofreviv-ingthe economyhalfdone. Fixingthingswill onlyget harderastime passes. Asitis, publicdebtisover250% ofGDP. Thepopulation isageingand the workforce shrinking—drags ongrowth thatwill groweverheavier.North Korea’swarmongeringmayhave shifted some vot-ers’ attention from the economyto national security. Thisplaysto MrAbe’sstrengths: in dealingwith Kim JongUn, Japanneedsa forceful leaderwho workswell with itsdiﬃcult ally,Donald Trump’sAmerica. However, in the longrun, a failure toaverteconomicdecline will pose asgreata threatto Japan’sse-curity. The economicmalaise haslasted forso longthat manyvotersand politiciansmaythinktheycan live with it. Butbigbudgetdeﬁcitsand loose monetarypolicycan onlypaper overthe problem. In the meantime, the opportunityto ﬁxthingswithoutgreatupheaval isslippingaway. 716LeadersThe EconomistSeptember30th20172OWNERSHIPused to beaboutasstraightforward aswritinga cheque.

The 55 delegatesto America’sﬁrstand so-far-onlyconstitutional conven-tion had hammered outcompromisesonthe separation ofpowers, apportionmentofseatsin the legislature and the future ofthe slave trade. Buton September15th 1787George Mason, a plantation ownerfromVirginia, rose to hisfeetto object.Article Vofthe drafttextlaid out twopathsbywhich future amendmentscouldbe proposed. Congresscould eitherpro-pose them itself, oritcould summon a con-vention ofrepresentativesfrom the statesto propose them. Mason warned thatif thefederal governmentwere to become op-pressive, Congresswould be unlikelytocall a convention to correctmatters. To pro-tectthe people’sfreedom, he argued, con-veningpowershould instead be vested inthe states. Should two-thirdsoftheir legis-laturescall fora convention, Congresswould have to accede to theirdemand: aconvention theyshould have. The constitution wassigned two dayslater, with Article Vchanged asMason hadsuggested. Since then 33 amendmentshave been proposed, with 27 subsequentlyratiﬁed, a processwhich requiresapprovalin three-quartersofthe states(see chart 1on nextpage). Whetherthe issue wasgreat(abolishingslavery) orsmall (changing thedate ofpresidential inaugurations), all 33ofthe proposalscame from Congress. Ma-son’smechanism forchange driven bystate legislatureshasneverbeen used.Even politicallyinformed Americansoftenhave no idea itexists. Thatcould soon change. In recent yearsthe Balanced BudgetAmendmentTaskForce (BBATF)—a shoestringgroup that re-ceived just$43,000 in donationsin 2015—hasbeen campaigningwith greatsuccessforsuch an “Article V” convention. Thereare now27 statesin which the legislatureshave passed resolutionscallingfora con-vention thatwould propose a balanced-budgetamendment. The two-thirds-of-the-statesthreshold forcallinga conven-tion is34. And, asithappens, there are sev-en stateswhich have notyetcalled for aconvention to propose a balanced-budgetamendment, butin which Republicanscontrol both housesofthe legislature.The earliestall seven could plausiblymake the call is2019, because Montana’slegislature isnotin session again untilthen. Bill Fruth, a co-founderofthe BBATF,saysthatbythatpointhe hopesto have theothersixin the bag. Ifhe does, then a con-vention would be on the cards. Ifhis eﬀortsfalter, a biggerpush iswaitingin the wings.Called the Convention ofStates(CoS), itpromisesamendmentson three topics: abalanced budget, limitingthe federal gov-ernment’spowerand establishingtermlimitsformembersofCongress. Led byMarkMeckler, a formerTea Partyactivist,the CoSgotitsﬁrstresolution passed in2014. Butithasgrown fast. Itisfar better-funded than the BBATFand claims2.2mvolunteersacrossthe country; itsadvisersinclude Jim DeMintand Tom Coburn, twoinﬂuential formerRepublican senators. Itsresolution hasnowpassed in 12 states. MrMeckler, like MrFruth, sayshe aimsto have 34 statessigned up bythe end of2019. Outside observerstake thatpredic-tion seriously. Pete Sepp ofthe NationalTaxpayers’ Union (NTU), which haslongadvocated a balanced-budgetamend-ment, putsthe probabilityofan Article Vconvention beingcalled by2020 at50-50.So doesJayRiestenbergofCommonCause, an organisation devoted to govern-mentreform which ﬁercelyopposesan Ar-ticle Vconvention.

Al-though the mostsuccessful Article Vcam-paignershave been conservatives, someon the leftlike the idea, too. Theythink thestatusquo isdefective, thatconstitutionalﬁxesneed to be applied and thata conven-tion ostensiblycalled forthe purposes ofabalanced-budgetamendmentmight, oncein session, be convinced to widen its ambitand considerotheramendmentstoo.

No one hasa ﬁrm countof thenumberofresolutionsthatstate legisla-tureshave passed callingforone, but itisover500. In 1963 Arkansaseven passed aresolution callingforan Article Vconven-tion to putforth an amendmentremovingMason’sconvention procedure from Arti-cle V. Today, 42 stateshave atleastone Arti-cle Vapplication pending. Given thatArticle VsaysCongress mustcall a convention once two-thirdsofthestateshave asked forone, whyhasit not?One answeristhatno one with standinghasgone to courtand asked itto. Anothermaywell be that, withoutconsciousdelib-eration on the subject, Congresshasdecid-ed thatitneeds34 applicationsnotjust foranyold convention, butfora speciﬁc con-vention: applicationsthatshare a topic,wordingand the like. ThisiswhattheBBATFand CoSare tryingto provide. Theyare notthe ﬁrstto make such apush. In the 1970sthe NTUbegan a cam-paign to passstate resolutionsfora conven-tion on a balanced-budgetamendment. By1983 the projectwason the brinkofsuccess;32 state legislatures, some ofthem Demo-cratic, had signed up, and California andMontana were setto hold ballotinitiativesthatwould have forced theirlegislatures toadd to those applications. Butstate courtsruled the two ballotinitiativesunconstitu-tional, and the eﬀortstalled (see chart 2).With the amenders’ momentumsapped, theiropponentsgained the upperhand. Somewhatsurprisingly, the most ef-fective response came from the right. TheJohn Birch Society, a far-rightfringe group,launched a counter-campaign; the EagleForum, a conservative group bestknownforitsﬁghtagainstan amendmentguaran-teeingwomen equal rightsto men, led asimilarcharge. Bythe late yearsofBill Clin-ton’spresidencythe budgetwasin surplus,takingfurtherwind outofthe movement’ssails. Manystateswhich had passed reso-lutionsrescinded them. ButunderGeorge W. Bush the deﬁcit re-turned, and in 2009 the ﬁnancial crisisdrove itup to levelsnotseen since the sec-ond world war. “When I saw[the FederalReserve] printingcurrency, that’swhen Igotmotivated to workon this,” saysMrFruth. “I became frightened asa citizen.”One yearlater, Republicanssweptthe mid-term elections. Democratslosthundredsofseatsin state legislatures. Because 2010wasa censusyearthe newlyempoweredRepublicanswere in a position to overseeredistricting, and thusin some placesableto cementtheirnewadvantage. In 2009there were 14 stateswhere Republicanscontrolled the whole legislature. By2017there were 33. The landslide of2010 open-ed a purelypartisan path to a convention.Since 2010 the BBATFhashelped getres-olutionspassed in 15 stateswhich previ-ouslylacked them. Butitsopponentshaveswungbackinto action, too. Theyfall intotwo camps: those who fearthatan ArticleVconvention will do whatitsadvocateswantitto, and those who fearthatit willnot. The ﬁrstcohortconsistsprimarily ofliberals, who see a balanced-budgetamendmentasa vehicle forright-wingdreamsofrollingbackAmerica’swelfarestate. “The rightisveryfrustrated withCongress’sinabilityto cutthese social-safety-netprogrammes, and thisistheirbackdoorwayto do it,” saysChrisTaylor, aDemocraticassemblywoman in Wiscon-sin. Ata conference held in 2013 bytheAmerican Legislative Exchange Council, agroup thatwritesmodel conservative billsforstate lawmakersto introduce, MsTaylorremembershearingdelegatestalkabout“the purpose beingto kneecap the federalgovernmentand prohibititfrom regulat-ingand spendingin everyarea except na-tional defence.” Alargergroup ofcritics, whose strangebedfellowsinclude the Birchers, the Amer-ican Civil LibertiesUnion and CommonCause, hasfocused on the riskofa run-awayconvention veeringoﬀinto non-budgetarytopics. The opportunityto pro-pose amendmentswithoutthe normalhurdle ofgettingthem pasttwo-thirds ma-joritiesin both the House and Senatemightprove hard forideologuesto resist.Would conservative delegatesreallyvoteagainst, say, a separate amendmentassert-ingthatthe protectionsofcitizenship startatconception? Argumentslike thishave worked insome more liberal states. Delaware, whichpassed an application fora balanced-bud-getamendmentin 1976, rescinded itlastyear; NewMexico, Maryland and Nevadafollowed suitin 2017. Butthattacticseemsto have run outofroom; none ofthe re-maining27 stateslookslikelyto rescind. In-stead the focusisnowon the seven stateswith Republican-controlled legislaturesthathave yetto requesta convention: Ida-ho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, SouthCarolina, Virginia and Wisconsin. In someofthese states, opponentsare putting up astrongenough ﬁghtthata convention isnotaforegone conclusion. In March the IdahoSenate, where Republicanshold a 29-6 ma-jority, shotdown an Article Vapplication.Virginia’sHouse ofDelegatesapprovedan Article Vapplication in 2016, butRich-ard Black, a Republican state senator, hashelped stymie the resolution’sprogresswith warningsofdeviousDemocratshi-jackinga convention. “Theycould changefreedom ofreligion to saycertain teachingsfrom the Bible are hate speech,” he toldsupportersbye-mail in 2015. “Theycouldtake awayourrightto own a gun.”And there are indeed people on the leftwho like the idea ofturningsuch a conven-tion to theirown ends.

ButArticle Vitself saysnothingaboutlimitingthe scope ofa con-vention. Indeed, itsaysnothingaboutmanyissueswhich, were a convention tobe called underitsauspices, would be-come contested: who would attend;whetheritwould be open to statesthathad notcalled forit; whatlimitsmight beplaced on itsdelegates; bywhatmajorityan amendmentwould need to passto beproposed; and so on. In the absence ofsuch guidance theBBATFconvened a meetingin PhoenixthisSeptemberto hammeroutitsown rules foraconvention. In spite ofa raucousgroup ofprotesters—one dressed asGeorge Wash-ington, complete with wigand stockings,and anotherwieldinga sign scoldingthedelegates“You’re No Hamilton”—theyagreed to give each state one vote regard-lessofpopulation, and to limitthe subjectmatterto the issue named in the states’ res-olutions, even ifa supermajoritywishedto add newtopics. Butfun astheywere to debate, the rec-ommendationsfrom the pow-wowinPhoenixhave no formal standing. Nordothe rulesthatpassed the Senate (but notthe House) in 1982 forthe convention onthe balanced-budgetamendmentthen be-ingproposed, which would have seen theseniorsenatorofthe majoritypartyandthe Speakerofthe House preside over theconvention, and required a three-ﬁfthsvote ofdelegatesto establish rulesof pro-cedure. IfCongressdoescall an Article Vconvention, itcan also passa newlaw go-verningthe delegates’ behaviour. Butifthe convention ignoressuch stric-tures, there mightbe no wayto enforcethem. Once a convention wasunderway,itsprocedureswould almostcertainly beimmune to judicial review. In 1939, whenthe Supreme Courtrefused to seta ratiﬁca-tion deadline fora proposed constitutionalamendment, itestablished a precedentthatthe mechanicsofamendmentsare a“political question”, reserved forelectedbranchesofgovernment. “There isabso-lutelyno force thatcan override what theconvention does,” saysDavid Super, a pro-fessoratGeorgetown Law. “Congresscansend them rules, state legislaturescan sendthem rules, buttheycan do whattheywant. I’m notsure there’d even be one voteforblockingiton the Supreme Court. Theprecedentisthatstrong.”Liberated from the foldThe convention’sfreedom appliesonlytoproposingamendments. Those changesstill need to be ratiﬁed by38 states—whichproponentsofa convention sayoﬀers acrucial checkon anyone doinganythingtheydo notapprove of. MrLessigdismiss-esCoS’swish listofamendmentsas“a cer-tain loser” atthe ratiﬁcation stage. MrMecklersaysMrLessigis“fantasising”abouta campaign-ﬁnance amendment:“Political realitymakes[it] unviable.”Butthe logicofa convention might ar-gue againstsuch purity. The delegates, ex-pectingthe supportofthe solidlyRepubli-can state legislaturesthathad called theconvention, would knowtheyneededsome splitlegislaturesforratiﬁcation.Would theyreallybe above craftingtheiramendmentso asto contain somethingen-ticingto the otherside? There isalso the possibilitythat Con-gresscould choose ratiﬁcation bymeans ofstate conventions. Thisisa constitutionallyapproved alternative to ratiﬁcation bystate legislatures, which hasso farbeenused onlyonce—forthe amendmentthatrepealed the prohibition ofalcohol. In thatcase manystatesdetermined the make-upoftheirconvention bya popularvotewhich in eﬀectbecame a referendum onthe amendment. Asa balanced-budgetamendmentmight, in some states, be morepopularwith the publicthan with legisla-tors, itmightbe more easilyratiﬁed bythisunusual route. Pollshave consistently sug-gested that65-70% ofthe publicsupportsuch an amendmentin principle.There isalso a longgame to be played.The statesdo nothave to ratifythe amend-mentall atonce, orin a rush. The 27thamendment, which preventsmembersofCongressfrom raisingtheirsalaries, wasproposed in 1789; itdid notgetits38th ratiﬁ-cation until 1992. Unlessthe proposersputatime limiton theiramendment’sratiﬁca-tion—ashasbeen the case formost20th-centuryamendments—itcan sitaround ac-cumulatingratiﬁcationsin perpetuity. AsMason intended, the federal governmentwould have no wayto blockthe process.Though some statesmightin time tryto re-scind theirinitial ratiﬁcations, this wouldbe anotherarea where the constitution ismum and the courtswill notventure. And then there is, asthere alwaysseemsto be, a nuclearoption. Delegatescould simplydeclare a new, lowerthresh-old forratiﬁcation. Uniquelyin mattersconcerningArticle Vconventions, there isactuallysome precedentforthis. The Arti-clesofConfederation, signed in 1777 andratiﬁed byall 13 original statesin 1781, re-quired the unanimousconsentofall statesforanychanges. The constitutional con-vention of1787 ignored this, decidingthatratiﬁcation bynine ofthem would be suﬃ-cientfortheirdocumentto replace the arti-cles. UnlessArticle Visamended ﬁrst, aconvention would have no constitutionalpowerto change the ratiﬁcation rules itself.Butdelegatesstill mighttry. “The sovereignpeople have the rightto alterorabolishtheirform ofgovernmentand change it towhatevertheywant,” saysLarryGreenleyofthe John Birch Society. “Thisisa conven-tion thatcreatesconstitutions. It’sa levelabove state legislatures, and can’tbe limit-ed. We reallybelieve thatanyArticle Vcon-vention would have the abilityto changethe ratiﬁcation process.”Alegal requirementto balance the bud-getcould, ifitincluded no safetyvalves,greatlydamage the government’sability tomanage economicshocks. Ifitwere care-fullydrafted, itmightconceivablydo amodicum ofgood. Whetherthatwould beworth the risksoftriggeringan untestedand remarkablypoorlyconstrained consti-tutional mechanism with huge potentialpower, though, isanothermatter.7WIWAIDMTNDMNILMIORNVWYSDIAINOHPANJCTRICAUTCONE*MOKYWVVASCGAFLMDDEAZNMKSARTNNCOKTXHIAKLAMSALNYMAVTNHMEControl ofstate legislature DemocraticRepublicanRepublican-led coalitionSenateHouse/AssemblyState legislaturehas passed:Balanced-budget-amendmentconvention resolutionConvention of StatesresolutionSeven states with Republican-controlledlegislatures have not applied for a conventionon a balanced-budget amendment Sources: Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force; NCSL; Convention of States*Nebraska’s unicameralstate legislature isformally non-partisan,but under de factoRepublican controlUnited States, September 2017Can we confer, Sir?The EconomistSeptember30th201725For daily analysis and debate on Asia, visitEconomist.com/asia1SHINZO ABE wantsto be rememberedformakingJapan greatagain.

He saysan earlyvote isneeded because he hashad achange ofheartoverhowto use the ¥5trn($45 billion) in estimated revenue from arise in the salestaxdue in 2019. He nowbe-lievesJapan should divert¥2trn ofthattoeducation ratherthan usingitall to paydown the publicdebt, which isalmost250% ofGDP. He also saysthatJapan needsto have a discussion aboutNorth Korea.DishonestAbeFewbuythisexplanation. Instead, observ-ersassume thatMrAbe considersthe tim-ingexpedient, forseveral reasons. First, hisapproval ratingsare close to 50% again,havingfallen to 30% orso in Julyfollowingallegations, which MrAbe denies, that heused hisinﬂuence to help two friends wingovernmentpermits. MrAbe’sbounce inthe pollsisprimarilythanksto North Ko-rea. Ithasrattled the usuallysanguine Japa-nese byﬁringtwo ballisticmissiles overbar, given thatitcurrentlyholdsover two-thirdsofthe seats. Fewin the LDPsee muchriskoflosingpower(the partyhasrun Ja-pan forall butﬁve ofthe past62 years). ButMPsare extremelyanxiousabouthowmuch itsmajoritywill shrink.The main reason forMrAbe’scaution isYuriko Koike, the governorofTokyo, whoismastermindingthe creation ofa new op-position outﬁt, the PartyofHope. Justhoursbefore MrAbe announced the elec-tion, MsKoike upstaged him bydeclaring,atan eventexpected to reveal the name ofapanda born ata zoo in Tokyo, thatshewould lead the newparty. Ithasalreadypersuaded 14 MPsto defectto it, mainlyfrom the DP, and islikelyto recruitmanymore. Itplansto ﬁeld candidatesfor atleast100 seats. MsKoike, a shrewd tactician, has re-peatedlyhumiliated the LDP, ofwhich sheused to be a seniormember. Afteritpassedheroverwhen pickinga candidate for go-vernor, she ran anyway, defeatingthe oﬃ-cial LDPcandidate. She then setup a localpartywhich trounced the LDPin the elec-tion forTokyo’sassemblyin July. To add in-sultto injury, hercandidatesformed an al-liance with Komeito, which isin coalitionwith the LDPatthe national level.Some surmise thatMrAbe called theelection earlyto give MsKoike almost notime to setup hernewparty. Butshe ismovingfast. In addition to courtingMPsfrom the nowdefunctDP, the PartyofHope isalso pursuingmergersorallianceswith several smalleropposition parties.Were MsKoike to build a largelyuniﬁedopposition, she mighteven step down asgovernorto lead it.Such a gamble could leave herpoliticalcareerin tatters. Yetitmightdo similardamage to MrAbe’s. Hertalkoftranspa-rencyand reform exploitsvoters’ misgiv-ingsaboutthe prime minister. Theyhave the northern island ofHokkaido andthreateningto bomb the whole countryinto the sea. Atsuch moments, voters feelsaferhidingbehind MrAbe’sskirts. He hasstrengthened relationswith othercoun-tries(in partbecause formerJapaneseprime ministershave come and gone soquicklythatmeetingswith counterpartsnevergotpastintroductions) and has theearofPresidentDonald Trump.Second, the DemocraticParty(DP), themain opposition, wasata particularly lowebb when the election wascalled, even byitsown dismal standards. Ithad opted forstyle oversubstance lastyearbyelectingRenho Murata, a formernewsanchor, as itsleader. Butshe resigned afteronlytenmonthsin the job. Seiji Maehara, its newleader, failed to revive the party’sfortunes.Humiliatingly, itwasattractingonly single-digitsupportin mostpolls. Aftermany ofitsMPsdefected, MrMaehara in eﬀect dis-banded the partyon September28th, tell-ingitsMPsto run asindependentsorjoinotherparties. ForMrAbe ithelps, too, thatdissolvingthe parliamentwill spare himfrom beingasked furtherquestionsaboutthe scandals.Buteven with the help ofMrMaeharaand Kim JongUn, North Korea’sdictator,MrAbe doesnotseem to thinkthe cam-paign will be easy. On September25th hesaid he would considerita successif therulingcoalition retained a simple majorityin the 465-seatlowerhouse.

The local media are alreadyframing theelection asa duel between MrAbe and MsKoike. Butthe two do notdiﬀermuch insubstance. Both wantto amend the partsofthe constitution thatplace restrictionson the armed forces; MrAbe hassaid thathe wantsto puta change to a referendumby2020. He also sayshe will push for a fur-therstimulusof¥2trn, butisalso trying toappeal to ﬁscal hawksbypledgingto goahead with the taxrise. MsKoike says shewould delaythe taxhike, butcriticises MrAbe forunsustainable spending. Thatshedid a stintasan adviseron defence to MrAbe, and then asdefence minister, makeshera rival to MrAbe even on hispet topic,security. (She hasalso lived in Cairo andspeaksArabicand English.) The Party ofHope’spledge to end MrAbe’sattemptstorestartnuclearpowerplantsthatwere shutdown afterthe Fukushima disasterin 2011will also be popular.Fully42% ofvotersare undecidedaboutwhom to vote for, accordingto a polltaken before MsKoike made heran-nouncement. Anothersounding, takenafterit, putthe PartyofHope’ssupportat18%—an impressive showingfora new-born party, butstill trailingthe LDPat29%.Even ifMsKoike failsto win much supportoutside Tokyo, there are 91LDP-held seatsup forgrabsin and around the capital. OneprominentLDPlawmakerhasdefected toherparty.Alossof14 seatswould bringMrAbe’scoalition belowthe two-thirdsthresholdrequired to call a referendum to amend theconstitution. Thatwould be a setback, butnotenough ofa disasterto prompta rebel-lion within the LDP. Ifhe were to lose 50seatsormore, he mightface pressure tostep down, oratleastto saythathe will notrun in the party’sleadership election nextyear. Eitherway, the election seemsunlike-lyto increase MrAbe’sclout—a worryforthose who were relyingon him to ﬁnd acure forJapan’sailingeconomy. 7BILLENGLISH, NewZealand’sprimeminister, looked everyinch the victorafterthe election on September23rd. “Wegotbetterand better,” he crowed asthecountrolled in. “No one expected thatjustthree weeksago.” Hiscentre-rightNationalpartywon 46% ofthe vote, puttingittenpercentage pointsahead ofitsmain rival,Labour, with which some pollshad sug-gested itwasneck-and-neck. The resultwasremarkable notonlybecause MrEng-lish fended oﬀLabour’stelegenicnewleader, Jacinda Ardern. Itisalso striking be-cause, afteralmosta decade in power anddespite a change in leadership, the Nation-alsseem asstrongasever. Celebrations, however, are premature.Anyleaderwho can command a majorityin the 120-seatparliamentmayform a gov-ernment. The Nationalshave fallen justshort, with 58 seats, butcould easilygetoverthe line byallyingwith the populistsofNewZealand First, who won nine seatsand 7.5% ofthe vote (see chart). The primeministersaysthathispartyhasthe “moralauthority” to begin a fourth term, yet La-bourhasnotconceded defeatbecause itcould theoreticallystitch togethera tenu-oustrifecta with NewZealand Firstand theGreens. Winston Peters, the leaderof NewZealand First, losthisconstituencybut willremain in parliamentthanksto NewZea-land’ssystem ofproportional representa-tion. He nowholdsthe balance ofpower. MrPeters, who wantsto ban foreign in-vestmentand give politiciansfree rein tomeddle atthe central bank, sayshe will notrush into “premature” decisions. Whenasked howlonghisnegotiationsmighttake, he threatened to throwa reporter intothe ocean (theylasted two monthsthe pre-vioustime he waskingmaker, in 1996).There isgood reason to thinkthathe willeventuallywalkup the aisle with MrEng-lish, even though hiscampaign slogan thisyearwas“Had enough?” Although itisnotarequirement, the largestpartyhasalwaysformed the government. The economyhasdone well underthe Nationals. And votersmightsee a coalition with Labourasover-turningthe resultsofthe election, given thesize ofthe Nationals’ lead.MsArdern, however, maintainsthatoverhalfofNewZealanders“votedagainstthe statusquo”. Labourgained 13seatswhile the Nationalslosttwo. She saysshe still hasa good chance ofbecomingprime minister. NewZealand Firsthasmore in common with Labour, whichwantsto cutimmigration and preventfor-eignerswho do notlive in NewZealandfrom buyinghomes. Ithaslabelled the Na-tionals’ free-marketreformsasa “failedeconomicexperiment”.MrPetershasalso feuded with bigwigsin the Nationalssuch asSteven Joyce, the ﬁ-nance minister. He mightexpectto holdgreaterswayoverMsArdern, who needshim more, than overMrEnglish. And histwo previoustie-upswith incumbentswere followed byheavylossesforNewZealand First, notesMatthewHooton, apolitical analyst, so itmaybe “in hisinter-estto side with someone new”. AsimilarlogicmightpromptMrPeters, who is72and hasalreadyserved asdeputyprimeminister, to refuse to join anycoalition. Anotherfactorcomplicatingcoalition-buildingisthatthe election results havenotbeen ﬁnalised. The ballotsof380,000people who were eitherlate to register,needed help votingorlive abroad have yetto be counted. These have tended to skewtowardsLabourand the Greensin the past,and mayyetresultin a seatortwo beingadded to eitherparty’stally.

Thatputthemoutside the homeland thatTamil separat-istsfoughtforduringthe longcivil war, andleavesthem marginalised within the Tamilminority.

Indian lawerectsno barriersto mar-riagesbetween faiths, oragainstconver-sion bywillingand informed consent. Yetthe idea still sticks, even when the sup-posed “victims” dismissitasnonsense.In May, a courtin the southern state ofKerala summarilyannulled a ﬁve-month-old marriage on groundsthatthe wife, aconvertto Islam, had disobeyed herpar-entsand been lured into a potentially dan-gerousliaison with a Muslim man. Sensi-tivitiesin Kerala have been high since thediscovery, lastyear, thatseveral newly-wed Muslim coupleshad emigrated toﬁghtforIslamicState. Still, itseemed bi-zarre fora judge to orderthis24-year-oldwoman, who had converted a yearbeforemeetingherfuture husband, while study-ingata medical institute, to return to herparents’ house.

MrMoon promised more downtimebefore he waselected in May. He pledgedto make takingholidaysmandatoryandto considerincreasingthe entitlement to20 daysto protectwhatone advisercalls“the rightto rest”.

The inescapable lesson isthatanotherKorean conﬂictwould carrysuch a price thatriskingit should notbe an option. Those who appearto thinkthatmilitaryaction isaplausible route wildlyoverplaythe chancesofa swift, clean re-sultand vastlyunderplaythe likelycostsofconﬂict, particularlyifitwentnuclear, orifthe North deployed itsbiological andchemical weapons. ScottSagan ofStanford Universityreckons1m people could die in the ﬁrstdayofa second Korean war. America suﬀersfrom Korean amnesia partlybecause, as MrHarden argues, an ingloriousstalemate isnoteasyto celebrate(even the 1970ssitcom M*A*S*H, although setin Korea, wasreallyaboutthe Vietnam war, then underway). Itisworse, though. Yes,Americanswere ﬁghtinga justwar, defendingSouth KoreaagainstSoviet-sanctioned invasion bythe CommunistNorth.Theywere supported byan “uncommon coalition” ofcountries—from Turkeyto Thailand—in whatwasthe ﬁrstinstance of collec-tive securityagreed upon bythe youngUN. Yetthe Americansprosecuted the warup to theirchestsin a moral swamp.Seniorcommandersturned a blind eye to atrocitiesby SouthKorean forcesagainstsuspected Communistsand prisoners-ofwar. Worse, the American destruction ofthe North’stownsandcitieswasnear-total, leadingto unconscionable civilian suﬀering.In early1951DouglasMacArthur, the American commanderofUNforces, waseven eagerto drop atom bombson Chinese forcesthathad come to the North Korean regime’sdefence. Betterforgotten. Yetin North Korea, the warisever-present.North Koreansare ceaselesslyreminded ofthe American de-struction. MrTrump, soundinglike a latter-dayMacArthur, playsrightinto the propaganda. Above all, North Koreanshave allalongbeen told itwasthe American-backed South thatstartedthe war, ratherthan a North Korean invasion ofSouth Korea.MrKim surelydoesnotbelieve thatlie. He and hisgeneralsknowthe warwentawfullyforhisgrandfather, Kim Il Sung. Heapproached the invasion with breathtakingnaivety. The Southwould rise up in supportofhim; the Americanswould not com-mittroops; itwould all be overin three days. He waswrong on allthisand more. When CommunistChina committed 300,000troopsto stop the creation ofa united, US-allied Korea, the “GreatLeader” wasshunted aside asmilitarycommanderand had totwiddle histhumbswhile otherssaved hisodiousregime.Thingswould go farworse forNorth Korea a second timeround (notleastsince tieswith China, which doesnotwant topicka ﬁghtwith America overNorth Korea, are deeplystrained).MrKim surelyknowsthis. ButdoesMrTrump knowthathe does?MrKim cannotbe dissuaded from seekinga nucleararsenal, forhe seesitashischiefguarantee againstAmerican attack. Butherealisesthatusingitwould bringabouthisdestruction. So the bigriskisan accidental war, caused byeach side misreading the oth-er’sintentions. ThatiswhatAmerica mustguard against.Cold comfortInstead ofswaggerand threats, America should prepare for an ex-tended cold war, containingand deterringa newnuclear power.Some ofthe militaryimplicationsare awkward. Forinstance,beeﬁngup missile defencesorbringingtactical nuclear weaponsbackto South Korea would hugelyunsettle China (see page 33),strainingthe world’smostcrucial relationship.Othernecessarystepswill be almostasawkward. Ifmisread-ingthe otherside’sintentionsisthe risk, one answeristo inviteNorth Korea to open an embassyin Washington, howevergallingthatmayfeel; a hotline between Pyongyangand Seoul shouldalso be revived. Spycraftand diplomaticskill are needed foran ef-fective regime ofsanctionsagainstthe North, butso is ﬂexibility—forinstance in tradingreassurancesforearlynotice of North Kore-an missile tests. And America mustﬁnd newwaysto signal to or-dinaryNorth Koreansthattheirregime isthe real target, notthem.Thisisnotimpossible, astrade and defectornetworksmanage tobringmuch information from outside into the North.MrTrump hasaslittle patience ashe hasa taste for history. But,asMrSagan pointsout, an enduringstrategyofdeterrence andcontainmentworked notonlywith the SovietUnion. Italso, forover60 years, discouraged the North from invadingSouth Koreaagain. And forall thatitnowpossessesnuclearweapons, MrKim’sregime isstill tinpotand decrepit, atop a mountain ofre-sentmentand wasted human lives. The chancesstill must be that,one day, the North will collapse underitsown contradictions.Justwait. 7The longwatchItis too late to getNorth Korea to give up its nukes, butnotto stop itfrom using themBanyanThe EconomistSeptember30th2017311For daily analysis and debate on China, visitEconomist.com/chinaONE CHILLYdaylastwinterZhangJie,suﬀeringfrom a fever, stopped his caron the side ofa busyroad to lethis wife runinto a shop to buya thermometer.

Lastyearcourtsagreed to hear330,000 such cases, morethan double the total in 2013—the ﬁrstfullyearofMrXi’srule (see chart). Manyofthese involve disputesoverland and hous-ing, the mostfrequentsourcesofconﬂictbetween ordinarypeople and the state.Othercommon casesrelate to pensionbeneﬁts, compensation forworkplace in-juriesand traﬃctickets. Benjamin Lieb-man ofColumbia LawSchool saysthatsu-ingthe governmentoversuch mattersisbecomingroutine in China.There have also been notable improve-mentsin the arena ofcommercial law. LastyearChinese courtsbegan hearingsin152,000 intellectual-propertydisputes, upnearlytenfold overthe pastdecade. The ex-plosive growth in IP caseshasbeen fuelledbythe growinglitigiousnessofdomesticcompanies, which have more to protect astheybecome more innovative. Butforeigncompaniesare also beneﬁting. In August acourtordered three Chinese ﬁrmsto pay10m yuan ($1.5m) in damagesto NewBal-ance, an American footwearcompany. Itwasone ofthe largesttrademark-relatedawardsevermade bya Chinese court.Luke Minford, chiefexecutive ofRouse,aconsultancy, hascalculated thatforeigncompanieswin 74% oftheirIPcasesagainstChinese ﬁrms, well above the 55%successrate forplaintiﬀsin casesthat onlyinvolve Chinese entities. There are, to besure, still unwritten limits. Dan Harris ofHarrisBricken, a lawﬁrm, saysitis a “verydiﬀerentcalculation” ifthe companybeingsued isa bigstate-owned enterprise.Yetthere isa glimmerofhope that Chi-ure hasbeen a bigdisappointment.

Tactical nuclearweapons—often meaningsmaller, battle-ﬁeld weaponsorair-dropped bombsnotcovered bystrategicarmstreaties—werewithdrawn from South Korea byGeorgeH.W.

Atthe heightofcold-wartensionsin the late 1960sand1970s, there were over700 tactical nuclearweaponsin South Korea, in missiles,bombsand even nuclearlandmines, notesJoel Witofthe US-Korea Institute attheJohnsHopkinsSchool ofAdvanced Inter-national Studiesin Washington.Conventional forceswill need to bebuiltup ifAmerican securityguarantees toalliesare to remain credible, saysMr Wit.Japan and South Korea mustdebate theirneed foreverythingfrom anti-missile sys-temsto more oﬀensive weapons, such asmissilesand advanced aircraft.

The storm rav-aged the island on September20th, andthen continued to deluge itwith rain thenextday. Itknocked outthe electricalgrid—itwill take monthsto restore powerto the whole island—and putan end tomostmobile communication. Itrenderedmanyroadsand bridgesimpassable. (Inthe storm’simmediate aftermath, beforereliefworkersdistributed satellite phones,some partsofthe island could be contact-ed onlybyrunners.) The Federal Emergen-cyManagementAgencyisprovidinghelp,relyingin parton the $15.3bn in fundingthatCongressallocated fordisasterreliefearlierin September, afterHurricanes Har-veyand Irma struckTexasand Florida, re-spectively. Butthe island’sgovernor, Ricar-do Roselló, isin no doubtthatmore help isneeded. Otherwise, he says, the islandfacesa “humanitarian crisis”.Even ifthatplea ismet, itisunlikely tostop the long-term damage to the island.Before the storm, Puerto Rico already facedan economiccollapse. Havingborrowedtoo much, and seen itseconomyshrink al-mosteveryyearsince 2005, the islandcommenced bankruptcy-like proceedingsin May. Thatwaspossible because ofa fed-eral lawpassed in 2016. Until then, unlikestatesand municipalities, ithad no way toescape itsunpayable $123bn in debtandpension obligations(worth 180% ofgrossnational income, GNI). The price forthe es-cape route wasa newﬁnancial oversightboard, appointed in Washington.The governmenthad hoped to balanceitsbudgetoverthree yearsbyimposingausterityworth over5% ofGNI annually.Buteven before Maria struck, the oversightboard did notthinkthe plan wascredible.Itwasinsistingon furloughsforthe island’spublic-sectorworkersto ensure the targetswere met. MrRoselló refused to comply,and faced a lawsuitoverthe matterin theisland’sfederal court(he said he was will-ingto go to prison overthe matter). Thatdispute nowlookslike a sideshow—just aswell, given thatthe hurricane hascausedthe courtto close indeﬁnitely.Puerto Ricans, who are American citi-zens, have been abandoningthe island. Atlastcount, itwaslosingon net68,000 peo-ple a year, or1.9% ofitspopulation. Thosewho have stayed are ageing, like the rest ofAmerica.

Apartfrom ensur-ingthe island getsimmediate help—includ-ingsuspendingthe JonesAct, which re-quiresall shipssailingbetween Americanportsto be built, owned and crewed byAmerican citizens—there are several waysCongresscould supportPuerto Rico’seconomyin the longterm. Lawmakerscould extend the earned-income taxcredit,awage top-up forlowearners, to the is-land’sresidents. Theycould ensure Medic-aid, health insurance forthe poor, is ade-quatelyfunded (federal Medicaid con-tributionsto Puerto Rico, unlike those tostates, are capped). And itcould waive theusual requirementthatthe island pay for10-25% ofitsdisasterrelief.The argumentagainstdoingthesethingsisthatPuerto Ricansdo notpay fed-eral income taxes.

Thedocument—though still relativelyshort ondetail, given the workthathassupposedlygone into it—proposesthe mostsigniﬁcantchange to the federal taxcode since 1986.Whetheritcan be turned into passable leg-islation, orwhetheritinstead meets thesame fate asRepublicans’ health-policyideas, remainsto be seen. Launchingthe plan, PresidentDonaldTrump reiterated hispromise thatthe taxcutswould beneﬁt“the middle class, theworkingmen and women, notthe highest-income earners”. To thatend, he promisesanear-doublingofthe standard deduction,the amountthatcan be earned before pay-ingincome tax. Foran individual, it wouldrise to $12,000, from $6,350 today. Thatismuch lessgenerousthan itsounds, be-cause Republicanswould also abolish thepersonal exemption, currentlyworth$4,050, which performsa similarfunction.The total amountthatcould be earned tax-free would go up onlyslightly. The plan isalso to raise the bottom rate ofincome tax,from 10% to 12%.The top rate oftax, bycontrast, wouldfall from 39.6% to 35%. (MrTrump saysCon-gressisfree to create a newtop tax rate forthe super-rich, butfewRepublicanswill bekeen to take up thatoption.) Yetnot everyhigh earnerwill celebrate. Though the plandoesnotsayso explicitly, MrTrump seemsto wantto do awaywith the exemption,from federal income tax, ofearningsusedto paystate and local taxbills. Republicansargue, rightly, thatthisunjustiﬁably subsi-disesstatesthatlevyhigh taxes.

Even to a sympatheticaudience—which a Na-tional Football League crowd isnot—the factthathe, the adoptedson ofa middle-classwhite couple, had earned $30m overthepreviousthree seasons, made itseem too much like celebritygrandstanding. Itwasalso unclearwhataction MrKaepernick,wearingnotleatherglovesbutsocksdecorated with pigs, recom-mended. Hisviewofpatriotism, a complicated issue for activistsportsmen, wasunclear. He atﬁrstsaid he could nothonour theﬂaguntil it“representswhatit’ssupposed to represent”.

Though hisprotestwastaken up by a fewotherblackplayers, itseemed likelyto ﬁzzle. Until, on September22nd, PresidentDonald Trump seized upon it. “Would youlove tosee one ofthese NFLowners, when somebodydisrespectsourﬂag, to say, ‘Getthatson ofa bitch oﬀthe ﬁeld rightnow, out, he’sﬁred!’” the presidentjeered, while campaigningin Alabama.Itwasnothard to see whatMrTrump wasup to. Confrontedbygrowingevidence ofdisenchantmentamonghiscore suppor-ters, especiallyin Republican statessuch asAlabama, he soughtto rallythem againsta common enemy. MostNFLplayers—in-cludingalmostall the ﬂagprotesters—are blackand sympathetictowardsMrKaepernick. Mostofthe league’sfans, and almostallitsowners, are white, conservative, approve ofthe ostentatiousﬂag-wavingdisplayscommon atAmerican sportingevents, anddislike those who would disruptthem.The presidentwasofcourse beinghypocritical—fewAmeri-can politicianshave run down America ashe has. Hiscriticismalso seemed to contain a racistdog-whistle, on which Mr Trumpalso hasform with MrKaepernick, though he denied race hadanythingto do with it. (MrTrump also slammed the modest mea-suresintroduced to limitthe brain damage playersincur). ItisamazingthatAmerica’spresidentcould treathiscountry’smostpainful divisionsso cynically. (“He doesn’teven care…” mar-velled LeBron James, a basketball player.) Yetthisisnot new: sow-ingdiscord, with no regard forthe consequencesbeyond howtheymightaﬀecthismood and standing, isMrTrump’scompul-sion and political method. And there islittle reason to expect, asmanyAmericansdo, thatin launchingan attackon America’smostpopularsportthisisaboutto fail him.TheNFL’sresponse represented an impressive rebuke. Whileover200 players“tooka knee” atthe nextopportunity, just asMrTrump musthave hoped theywould, theirteammates, white andblack, and also manyteam owners, stood overthem protectively,with a supportive hand on theirshoulders, orwith linked arms.Alongwith the inevitable schmaltziness—ofa sports-entertain-mentbehemoth thatfanciesitselfbesieged—thiswasa strong re-assertion ofFirstAmendmentrights. Even so, the president ap-pearsto have won thisone. Hispreference forﬂagreverence overthe freedom to protestiswidelyheld. Opinion pollssuggest mostNFLfansare still againstthe anthem protests. Manyalso agreewith MrTrump thatthe protestersshould be sacked.Alevellerplaying-ﬁeldYetthere are two reasonsto ﬁnd hope in thisfarrago. One isthat,even ifRepublicanslike MrTrump’sdivisive message, the pollsalso suggesttheywould preferhe focused on governing. Thisim-pliesthe culture war, though a strongsuitforMrTrump, will bringhim diminishingreturns. In a weekin which hisadministrationfailed to respond adequatelyto Puerto Rico’sdevastatinghurri-cane and hispartyfailed in itslatestattemptathealth-care re-form, Republican votersare startingto wantmore than noise.The othercause forhope isthat, ifyoutake a longer viewofAmerica’sprogress, which the country’srich historyofsport andprotestrecommends, the currentdrama doesn’tlookquite sougly. The main reason MrKaepernick’sprotestfound little pur-chase wasthathe, unlike Owens, Ali and the rest, wasnot a vic-tim, and thisreﬂectsa broadertruth. America’sminoritieshavemanyproblems, and blacksespecially, from high incarcerationratesto votersuppression; butwhite supremacyisover. Theirdestinyismainlyin theirown hands. Indeed, theywill shortlynoteven be a minority. By2020 a majorityofAmericansunder 18will notbe white.

transaction; oﬃcials decide such matters
as how many litres of diesel will be needed
for delivery trucks; investors cannot freely
send proﬁts home. Between March 2014
and November 2016 Cuba attracted $1.3bn
of foreign investment, less than a quarter
of its target.
Faced with a stalled economy and the
threat of shortages, the government is try-
ing harder to woo investors. It has agreed to
let food companies, for example, repatriate
some of their proﬁts. But anything more
daring seems a distant prospect. Cuenta-
propistas like Leo are waiting impatiently
for a planned law on small- and medium-

sized enterprises. That would allow them
to incorporate and do other sorts of things
that normal companies do. It will not be
passed anytime soon, says Omar Everleny,
a Cuban economist. 
An even bigger step would be a reform
of Cuba’s dual-currency system, which
makes state-owned ﬁrms uncompetitive,
keeps salaries in the state sector at miser-
able levels and distorts prices throughout
the economy. Cuban pesos circulate along-
side “convertible pesos” (CUC), which are
worth about a dollar. Although for individ-
uals (including tourists) the exchange rate
between Cuban pesos and CUC is 24 to

one, for state-owned enterprises and other
public bodies it is one to one. For those en-
tities, which account for the bulk of the
economy, the Cuban peso is thus grossly
overvalued. This delivers a massive subsi-
dy to importers and punishes exporters.
A devaluation of the Cuban peso for
state ﬁrms is necessary for the economy to
function properly. But it would bankrupt
many, throw people out of work and spark
inﬂation. Countries attempting such a de-
valuation usually look for outside help.
But, because of American opposition,
Cuba cannot join the IMF or World Bank,
among the main sources of aid. Fixing the

A battle over “gender ideology”

Social conservatives are ﬁghting back against feminism and gay rights
THIS year Peru introduced a new curri-
culum for its primary schools as part
of an eﬀort to improve education. One of
the new curriculum’s principles is that
boys and girls have the same right to edu-
cation. It notes that “while what we con-
sider to be ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’ is
based on biological-sexual diﬀerences,
these are roles which we construct from
day to day, in our interactions.” And
“some of those [socially] assigned roles”
lead to girls dropping out of school to take
on domestic chores.
To many people, this is a statement of
the obvious. Yet it provided fuel for a
growing campaign that holds that there is
a conspiracy in Latin America, known as
“gender ideology”, whose aim is to femi-
nise boys, turn girls into lesbians and de-
stroy the family. This might come as news
to many in a region notorious for machis-
mo. Nevertheless, the campaigners are
scoring victories.
In March a group called Con Mis Hijos
No Te Metas (“don’t mess with my kids”)
held a big march in Lima against the new
curriculum and against Marilú Martens,
the education minister implementing it.
Last month they got their way. Ms Mar-
tens was censured by the conservative op-
position majority in congress, ostensibly
over her mishandling of a teachers’ strike.
Her replacement, Idel Vexler, favours
withdrawing references to gender.
In Colombia last year Gina Parody,
who is openly lesbian, similarly lost her
job as education minister after her minis-
try had produced a manual to help
schools comply with a constitutional
court ruling that barred discrimination by
sexual orientation. One reason why a
peace agreement between the govern-
ment and the FARC, a left-wing guerrilla
group, was narrowly rejected in a referen-
dum last October was because the same

campaigners objected to its use of the term
“gender equity”.
In Mexico opponents of President En-
rique Peña Nieto’s proposal to legalise gay
marriage organised nationwide demon-
strations last year. A campaign bus has
been touring the country under the slogan
of Con Mis Hijos No Se Metan (“no one
messes with my kids”). Similar protests
have taken place in Europe, for example in
France and Poland.
Behind these events lies a long-stand-
ing campaign by conservatives in the Cath-
olic church against feminism, triggered by
a UN Convention against Discrimination
of 1979. This campaign has widened and
gained energy from opposition to gay mar-
riage and other gay rights, a cause that ap-
peals to evangelical Protestants as well as
Catholics. “These people try to establish a
moral panic and the idea that the family is
dissolving, which has no basis in fact,” says
Maxine Molyneux, a sociologist of Latin
America at University College London.
Gender is not an “ideology”, but it is a
lightning rod. Feminists argue that the
church’s representation of women—as
morally superior but physically subservi-

ent to the dominant male—has contribut-
ed to injustice and violence. Neverthe-
less, in recent decades Latin American
societies have become a bit more secular,
women have become less subordinated
and homosexuality is more tolerated. 
Whatever the church’s teaching, con-
traception is widely used and so, perhaps
surprisingly, is the “morning-after” pill.
Women have far fewer children than in
the past. There has been timid liberalisa-
tion of strict abortion laws in some coun-
tries. In August Chile’s constitutional
court upheld a law allowing terminations
in the case of rape or fetal deformation, or
if the mother’s life is endangered. Gay
marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Uru-
guay and some parts of Mexico. On aver-
age, in 2012 Latin American women were
paid only 84% as much as men with simi-
lar qualiﬁcations, but that is an increase of
12 percentage points since 1994. 
These advances are incomplete and
contested. Studies ﬁnd that around a third
of Latin American women suﬀer domes-
tic or sexual violence. Murders of gays in
Brazil are rising. Although many coun-
tries include sex education in the school
curriculum, in practice it is often not pro-
vided. In poorer rural areas, contracep-
tion can be hard to ﬁnd. 
Ms Molyneux notes that a new gener-
ation of feminists have taken to the streets
in countries like Argentina to denounce
violence against women and to demand
legal abortion. But it is the conservatives
who seem to have the initiative. In a re-
gion still struggling against deep inequal-
ities, that is worrying. As Ms Martens
wrote in El Comercio, a newspaper, vio-
lence and discrimination against women
originate “in subconscious prejudices”.
The way to eradicate those prejudices, she
went on, is through education. That is
why this battle matters so much.

SIX MONTHS AGO Sandrine Le Feur was growing leeks and raising
Highland sheep on her farm in Brittany. Bruno Studer was teaching his-

under the banner of La République en Marche (LRM), a political move-

dent in May, at the age of 39, and their arrival in parliament, mark the
greatest wholesale political clear-out France has seen since Charles de
Gaulle established the Fifth Republic in 1958. At a shaded terrace café out-
side parliament in June, such ﬁrst-time deputies were to be found hud-
dling over their National Assembly welcome packs. Included among the
helpful documents was a map of Paris.
As the ﬁrst disenchantments with the new regime set in, it is worth
recalling the remarkable events of the presidential and National Assem-
bly elections earlier this year. No guillotines fell. No tumbrils rolled. Yet
Mr Macron swept aside the old guard, rewrote the political rules and
brought about a quiet revolution. A one-time investment banker and for-
mer economy minister, he had never before run for elected oﬃce. Fully
78% of today’s deputies are new to this parliament. It has only 13 legisla-
tors over the age of 70; the previous one had 96.
At a time of angry populism and political nationalism the world
over, there was little to hint that France, of all countries, would be the one
to reaﬃrm unfashionable pro-European and liberal values. The country
had fallen out of love with the European project it co-founded. In 2005 it
rejected a draft European Union constitution in a referendum. Polls
showed the French to be among the continent’s most Eurosceptic people.
Twice, in 2002 (with Jean-Marie Le Pen as its candidate) and again this
year (with Marine Le Pen, his daughter), it voted the xenophobic and

Eurosceptic National Front (FN) into a presidential run-oﬀ.
France seemed to be trapped by immobilisme, a state of fearful
conservatism shaped by self-serving political parties, en-
trenched interests, risk aversion and lack of conﬁdence. 
Yet this year’s democratic purge suggests that, as Alain
Peyreﬁtte, a former minister, put it in 1976, “France succeeds only
by constructing enormous barriers, and then blowing them up.”
A highly centralised rule-bound system once served the country
well, bringing fast trains to every region and three-course meals
to every nursery school. But in recent decades France has piled
up taxes and public debt, crushed initiative and failed to generate
enough jobs, especially for the young. Between 2000 and 2016 its
GDP per person consistently grew more slowly than the OECD
average (see chart). Successive govern-
ments of the left and right largely failed to
nudge France out of its lethargy. Book titles
about “French Suicide” and “Unhappy
Identity” became bestsellers. Anti-estab-
lishment politics thrived. Disillusion and
despondency took hold.
Mr Macron thinks he spotted the reason. France was
blocked, he judged, not because of its inclination to protest or in-
nate resistance to change. It was because on all the pressing is-
sues—inequality, globalisation, the environment, Europe—par-
ties disagreed internally. “In France the political families of the
left and the right, structured in the post-war era, are exhausted
because of their own divisions and inconsistencies, and have no
more answers to the challenges of today,” he told The Economist
this summer. His idea was not to reinvent the politics of the cen-
tre: “If it had just been centrism,” he says, “I don’t think we would
have won.” It was, rather, to force a new alignment along a diﬀer-
ent fault line: between those sympathetic to an open society and
those tempted by nationalism, Euroscepticism and identity poli-
tics. So he blew up the party-political establishment.
This special report will look at France under its young presi-
dent; at what can be learned from the way he won power and is
starting to exercise it; and at his chances of succeeding in the huge
task he has set himself. Mr Macron wants not only to remodel
party politics and rebuild an “entrepreneurial and ambitious”
economy that can restore France’s clout in Europe. He also hopes
to turn France, and Europe, into a model of how to respond to
what he calls a “crisis of contemporary capitalism”. By this, he
means fashioning rules that encourage sustainable growth and
innovation while protecting the losers from technological
change and globalisation in order to minimise the risk of a popu-
list backlash and preserve the liberal order.
The mood in France remains volatile. The ﬁrst four months
of the Macron presidency have veered from relief (at his defeat of

president at this point

Ms Le Pen), admiration (at restored presidential dignity) and de-
light (at his muscular treatment of the Russian and American
presidents) to wariness (at his inclination to pomposity) and ap-
prehension (as spending cuts and labour reforms take shape).
France had been morose for so long that at times it seemed to
have lost faith in the possibility of renewal. Yet these things come
in cycles. Mighty Germany was dismissed as the sick man of Eu-
rope back in the early 2000s, and so was Britain in the mid-1970s.
At that time it was the French who were inventing the future:
launching Minitel (a precursor to the internet, in 1982) and super-
fast trains (the TGV, in 1981), and rejuvenating Paris with modern-
ist constructions in steel and glass. 
With an economic upturn in the euro zone, the conditions
for rebooting France are unusually favourable. Consumer conﬁ-
dence in the summer reached its highest level for ten years. Un-
employment has begun to drop. “The way the world looks at us
has completely changed,” says one head of a ﬁrm in the CAC 40,
which includes the top listed French companies. “Macron has re-
awakened optimism,” says another. He has given the French a
session of “group therapy”, commented Michel Houellebecq, a
novelist known for his nihilism. If Mr Macron gets it right, France
could, just possibly, be at the start of a new cycle.
Caution is nonetheless in order. Recent French history is lit-
tered with unkept political promises. Mr Hollande, a Socialist,
vowed “to re-enchant the French dream”; Nicolas Sarkozy, his
centre-right predecessor, a “rupture” with bad habits; and
Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist, to “mend the social fracture”. The
dream faded, the rupture never happened, and the social frac-
ture still runs deep. After his ﬁrst 100 days Mr Macron’s own ap-
proval rating had fallen to just 36%, the lowest of any modern

French president at this point. His opponents mock his deputies’
“amateurism” and accuse him of harbouring “a preference for
the rich”. Even friends worry that Mr Macron lacks an inner circle
of political heavyweights. However charismatic, he cannot do it
all himself. The forces that helped put him in the presidency—dis-
illusion with elites, dejection at joblessness—could yet turn
against him. The stakes are high, for France and Europe. If Mr
Macron fails, in ﬁve years’ time voters may not give a liberal
democrat a second chance. 

The start of something big

On successive Saturday mornings in the autumn of 2015,
the lift to a young government minister’s private apartment was
in constant use. In secret meetings, plans were hatched to start
something, although none of the participants knew quite what.
“A club for reﬂection”, recalls one; an “appeal for action”, says an-
other. What they shared with Mr Macron, the minister in ques-
tion, was a frustrated sense that there was a hidden majority in
favour of reforms, but no way to unlock it. Six months later Mr
Macron launched En Marche! (On the Move!). The following
year he—along with two young members of that original group—
stepped into the Elysée Palace.
Mr Macron owed his improbable victory in part to France’s
two-round electoral system, as well as to political luck. But he
also read the mood, created his own chances and exploited
them. At its launch, En Marche! was dismissed as a quaint dis-
traction by party barons among whose political families (under
various names) power had rotated since 1958. It had no money,

no members and no deputies. Yet Mr Macron “found enough
people who were suﬃciently mad, or lucid, to back him”, recalls
one. By refusing to deﬁne his party as on the left or the right, he
drew in those turned oﬀ by doctrinaire politics. By setting it up as
a “citizens’ movement”, with semi-autonomous local commit-
tees, he secured grassroots backing for his political assault. 
Today such local organisers sit dutifully, if at times awk-
wardly, on the red benches of the National Assembly. Opposi-
tion is muted. The Socialists have lost nearly 90% of their seats
and are struggling to survive. The Republicans have been
stripped of most of their moderates and are lurching to the right.
The FN boasts eight deputies but is straining to be heard. The
most audible voice may well come from the far left, under Jean-
Luc Mélenchon. It accuses LRM deputies of unthinking fealty to
Mr Macron (although this will itself be tested, especially when
novice politicians face angry constituents once reforms get going
and spending cuts bite). Indeed, the ﬁery Mr Mélenchon vows to
keep “one foot in the street”, so opposition may well be as deci-
sive outside parliament as discontent is vented through public
protests and demonstrations. “All revolutions are followed by
counter-revolutions,” cautions Dominique Reynié, a political
scientist. Mr Macron, after all, secured only 24% of the ﬁrst-round
vote. Twice as many votes went to anti-system candidates of the
far left or the far right. His victory was greeted with relief and sur-
prise, not jubilation. Distrust still simmers.
How Mr Macron manages resistance will determine his
prospects. Ask what he will do, and he simply says: “hold ﬁrm”.
He kept his nerve over labour reform, having laid out his plans
during the campaign and secured a mandate and parliamentary
majority to carry them out. He has built further legitimacy with a
post-partisan government, stealing his prime minister, Edouard
Philippe, and his ﬁnance minister, Bruno Le Maire, from the cen-
tre-right. If he campaigned with charm, he seems ready to govern
with steel. In July he sent a brutal message about political author-
ity to his top general, who had criticised defence cuts; the general
resigned. If anything, Mr Macron has an imperial concept of
French power and a distinct taste for its symbols, hosting foreign
leaders in Versailles one day and riding in a nuclear submarine
another. He has called this model “Jupiterian”, a reference to the
ancient Roman king of the gods. His opponents dub him, rather,
the “Sun King”. Even well-wishers worry about hubris. 

Just do it

Yet the unﬂappable philosophy graduate who now occu-
pies the ornate ﬁrst-ﬂoor oﬃce in the Elysée, just below where he
once worked as an adviser to Mr Hollande, seems undaunted by
the task, and seized by a sense of historic responsibility. “The big-
gest risk for the next ﬁve years is not to get things done,” he says.
In the short run Mr Macron may draw ﬂak for unpopular reforms
and grandiose tendencies. Yet his determination to do his own
thing, even marry a woman 24 years his senior, suggests an im-

perviousness to criticism that could help him endure disapprov-
al in the polls. The president certainly seems untroubled by self-
doubt. “He always knew he had a special destiny,” says a child-
hood friend. Mr Macron is also shrewd enough to learn from his
mistakes. Under Mr Hollande, he saw from the inside how to
make them. In the long run his Gaullist reading of institutions,
whereby the president concentrates on the grand scheme of
things while his prime minister deals with day-to-day aﬀairs,
could serve to protect him. 
Inﬂated political expectations often lead to excessive disap-
pointments. One clear-eyed Macron adviser warns of the
“Obama syndrome”. Voters in Europe also know about invest-
ing impossibly high hopes in young leaders (Britain’s Tony Blair,
Italy’s Matteo Renzi). Mr Macron’s unexpected victory, and his
ﬁrst months in oﬃce, reveal qualities that should help him navi-
gate tougher times. He has the ability to think ahead and to seize
opportunities; determination bordering on ruthlessness; and a
gift for embodying a hopeful optimism that has long eluded
France. But in the end he will be judged mainly by one thing:
whether he can put the economy back on track. 7

France is well placed to beneﬁt from the knowledge
economy

THE WORD “FACTORY” does not do justice to Bugatti’s
state-of-the-art production site in the shadow of the forest-
clad Vosges mountains in eastern France. There is no grease or
grime around the assembly line. The ﬂoor is a shimmering white
gloss. The airy space feels more like a museum of modern art,
gleaming eight-litre engines displayed like so many design exhib-
its. Workers wear white gloves, as if handling treasures. In fact,
they are building the world’s fastest supercar.
A Milanese engineer, Ettore Bugatti, founded a car factory
in this corner of France in 1909. Germany’s Volkswagen, which
later bought the brand, chose Bugatti’s historic French site to de-
velop the Veyron, a car designed to combine elegance and speed.
The French factory turned out every one of these luxury record-
breaking cars after their launch in 2005. This year Bugatti un-
veiled a successor, the Chiron, which pushes the limits of physics
and sleek design further still. The car reaches 100km (62 miles) an

hour in two-and-a-half seconds and has a starting price of €2.4m.
Christophe Piochon, head of the French plant, compares the ex-
quisite craftsmanship that goes into the construction of a Bugatti
car to haute couture. 
Although France has a reputation for making life diﬃcult
for business and struggles to hold on to low-end industries and
jobs, it is in some ways well placed to carve out a competitive
niche in the knowledge economy—if it can get its mix of taxes
and business regulation right. As the Bugatti factory suggests, the
country has strong traditions in both luxury and creative indus-
tries, as well as in engineering. It boasts excellent research in
maths and has a number of outstanding business and engineer-
ing schools. 
Moreover, something has begun to stir in corporate France,
as the car industry illustrates more broadly. In the past, French car
designers had a reputation for a certain cool. When Citroën
launched the futuristic DS “Goddess” in 1955, Roland Barthes, a
French structuralist, described it as “spiritual”. Now, after years
of turning out dull vehicles and focusing on cost-cutting by shift-
ing production to cheaper countries, French carmakers are back
on form. PSA has just bought General Motors’ European opera-
tions. Renault has launched the Alpine sports car, a retro nod to
its 1960s classic, which is being built in the French port of Dieppe.
The Renault-Nissan alliance took an early bet on electric vehi-
cles. By this year it had become the biggest carmaker in the
world. “A few years ago the motor industry was said to be the
steel of the 21st century, but today there’s an incredible eﬀerves-
cence in the sector,” comments Jacques Aschenbroich, head of
Valeo, which makes high-tech automotive parts, such as sensors
for driverless cars. Half of Valeo’s current orders are for products
that did not exist three years ago.
Like Valeo, other giants of the CAC 40, which provide the
world with tyres (Michelin), shampoo (L’Oréal), lipstick (Cha-
nel), yogurt (Danone), intelligence systems (Thales) and hand-
bags (Louis Vuitton), have long been globalised. France has more
ﬁrms than Germany in the Fortune 500. But a tangle of rules for
mid-sized ﬁrms deters small ones from expanding. France has
less than half as many mid-sized companies as Germany, and
half as many ﬁrms that export. Too few invest in digitisation. Last
year’s World Economic Forum competitiveness index ranked
France 21st overall, out of 138 countries, but only 33rd for ﬁrms’
adoption of technology. 

Enterpr ise à la française

Startups provide a good example of how better incentives,
and fewer burdens, could release French growth. High taxes on
stock options and bureaucratic rules used to make France a diﬃ-
cult place for them. But the boost Mr Macron gave the sector
when he was minister helped bring about a cultural shift. Ven-
ture-capital investment in France has increased sharply since
2014, and last year was higher than in Germany. France “used not
to celebrate success”, says Frédéric Court, a London-based ven-
ture capitalist, but he is now bullish about the country. Xavier
Niel, a billionaire entrepreneur and godfather to tech startups,
describes a “new alchemy” in France. 
The country has particular potential in sectors set for rapid
growth, notably machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and
big data. Two years ago Facebook set up its only European re-
search lab into AI in Paris because of the research going on in
France, says Antoine Bordes, who runs it. Young French gradu-
ates are increasingly trying their luck with startups. Hugo Mer-
cier, a 25-year-old engineering graduate, shunned corporate life
to launch Dreem, a headband that uses promising neurotechnol-
ogy to improve deep sleep. Another, Frédéric Mazzella, founded
BlaBlaCar, a ride-sharing startup now valued at about €1.4bn.

Fashion designer

This summer Mr Niel opened Station F, the world’s biggest incu-
bator in eastern Paris, designed to attract international talent.
“Within ﬁve years”, claims Mr Niel with his customary ﬂourish,
“France will be the top country in Europe for startups.”
“There is every reason in the medium run for economic
growth in France to match or exceed the average in the euro
zone,” says François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the cen-
tral bank. If growth in the French economy were to reach this av-
erage, combined with labour-market reforms, the eﬀect on un-
employment could be “spectacular”, he says. France also
beneﬁts from strong demographics, dynamic regional cities, ex-
cellent infrastructure, a ﬁrst-class health system and good public
services. The two main brakes on growth are well documented:
an overly large public sector and a rigid labour market. Public
spending accounts for 56% of GDP, the highest level in the OECD
(see chart, previous page), requiring higher taxation than in any
other OECD country bar Denmark, without generating more
growth in return. The rigid labour market discourages ﬁrms from
creating permanent jobs, and hiring young (and older) people.
French unemployment, at 9.8%, is at twice the German level; for
the under-25s it reaches 23%. The 3,500-page labour code oﬀers
little ﬂexibility, so ﬁrms use temporary contracts, often for less
than a month, which now account for over four-ﬁfths of new
contracts (see chart, next page). 
Mr Macron spent a lot of time hanging out with tech types
when he was economy minister and has a good grasp of what is
needed. He plans to reduce the corporate tax rate from 33% to 25%
over ﬁve years, and ease the payroll burden by transferring some
social charges to a more broad-based tax. He wants to encourage
investment in the productive economy by transforming the an-
nual personal-wealth tax into a property tax, and to put a ﬂat tax
on ﬁnancial income. By 2022 he plans to have curbed the share of

1

GDP consumed by public spending to 52% and to have sold oﬀ a
chunk of state holdings. “Our guiding principle is to create an en-
vironment in which companies can succeed,” says Mr Le Maire,
his centre-right ﬁnance minister. In this respect, the labour re-
form, agreed on earlier this month, is crucial. It will give compa-
nies more freedom to negotiate at enterprise level and reduce the
ﬁnancial risk of wrongful dismissals, a deterrent to hiring perma-
nent staﬀ. 
Further reforms draw on the insight that France needs to
adapt its system of rules and safeguards, designed in the post-
war years to protect jobs, to focus on protecting individuals in-
stead. “We need a state that says: I’m not going to lead your life for
you, I’m not there to replace what you do. Some will do well, oth-
ers less so. But I will protect you from the great accidents of life
and I will help give you the capacity to succeed,” says Mr Mac-
ron. The government intends, for example, to replace the spa-
ghetti soup of 35 diﬀerent pension regimes with a universal sys-
tem, based on individual points-based accounts, so as to
encourage job mobility. It wants to put more of the €32bn state-
mandated budget for training in the hands of individuals, using
personal credits; currently, 62% of the budget is spent on those
who already have jobs and only 14% on the unemployed. 
These are ambitious projects. Unifying France’s pension
system could take ten years, and public-spending cuts will be
contested. If the government achieves its aim of curbing the bud-
get deﬁcit to 2.9% this year, that will be the ﬁrst time in ten years
that it has dipped below 3%. What makes Mr Macron’s proposed
reforms more promising than past eﬀorts is their transparency.
Plans to change pensions in 1995 and to introduce a ﬂexible work
contract for the young in 2006 had not been ﬂagged up in the pre-
ceding election campaigns, and were roundly defeated by the
street. Mr Macron, by contrast, spelled out his reforms and se-
cured a mandate for them. He has put a mix of specialists and ca-
reer politicians in government to implement them. He has also
been careful to maintain a dialogue with interested parties. Mu-
riel Pénicaud, his labour minister, held about 50 meetings with
unions and bosses this summer. They seem to have found a con-
structive partner in the Confédération Française Démocratique
du Travail (CFDT), a moderate union, which has overtaken the
hardline Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) in the private
sector for the ﬁrst time since it was founded in 1895. “The French
elected the president because they wanted something new,” says
Laurent Berger, the head of the CFDT. “I’m convinced they want
that novelty elsewhere too, including from unions.” 
It would be remarkable if the country were able to shift to a
less theatrical form of conﬂict resolution. Confrontation and
street drama still retain a ro-
mantic hold on the collective
imagination. Mr Macron’s
plans could yet go wrong. Some
of his opponents, who portray
him as unforgivably pro-busi-
ness, will seek conﬂict for polit-
ical ends. A web of public-sec-
tor
industrial 
interests will
resist disruption, too. Mr Mac-
ron is not looking for a show of
force, but he seems ready to en-
gage in one if need be. If he can
break with his predecessors’
habits, manage reform wisely
and put in place the basis for a
more sustainable upturn, the
French economy may at last re-
alise its promise. 7

Education

The tyranny of normal

One kind of education does not ﬁt all

THE MOST STARTLING feature of Sandy Sablon’s class-
room at the Oran-Constantine primary school, on the out-
skirts of the northern port of Calais, is the collection of old tennis
balls that she has wedged on to the legs of all the little chairs. The
teacher spent a weekend gashing and ﬁtting the lime-green balls
in order to cut down noise. This became a problem when she in-
troduced new teaching methods. Out went desks in rows. In-
stead, she grouped children of a similar level of achievement
around shared tables, which meant pupils got up and moved
about much more. 
All the strains of post-industrial France crowd into Fort
Nieulay, the Calais neighbourhood surrounding the school. Red-
brick terraced houses, built for the families of dockers and indus-
trial workers in the 1950s, jut up against rain-streaked tower
blocks. On the estate, the Friterie-Snack Bar is open for chips, but
other shop fronts are boarded up. The children’s swings are bro-
ken. Sophie Paque, the primary’s energetic head, says a stagger-
ing 89% of her pupils live below the poverty line. “We give them a
structure they don’t have at home.” Youth unemployment in Ca-
lais is over 45%, twice the national average. In Fort Nieulay it
touches 67%. 
This autumn Oran-Constantine, like 2,500 other priority
classes nationwide, is beneﬁting from Mr Macron’s promise to
halve class sizes to 12 pupils for ﬁve- and six-year-olds. The new
policy caused a certain amount of chaos elsewhere, but Oran-
Constantine was ready. It had already been part of a pilot scheme
launched in 2011, with smaller class sizes for rigorous new read-
ing sessions and more personalised learning. This was put in
place under an education oﬃcial, Jean-Michel Blanquer, who is
now Mr Macron’s education minister. Faster learners use voice-
recognition software on tablet computers, freeing up their teach-
er to help weaker classmates. “French teachers tend to advance
like steamrollers: straight ahead at the same speed,” says Chris-
tophe Gomes, from Agir pour l’Ecole, the partly privately ﬁ-
nanced association that ran the government-backed pilot
scheme; here “pupils set the pace.” Some teachers feared that
technology was threatening their jobs, but found instead that it
allowed them to do their jobs better. One year into the experi-
ment, the number of pupils with reading diﬃculties at the 11
schools in Calais that took part had halved. 
Such techniques may not seem controversial elsewhere,
but in France they challenge central educational tenets. For many
years, education has been subject to what might be called “the
tyranny of normal”. Ever since Jules Ferry introduced compul-
sory, free, secular primary education in the 1880s, uniform
schooling countrywide has been part of the French way of doing
things. The 19th-century instituteur, or schoolteacher, was a mis-
sionary ﬁgure, a guarantor of republican equality and norms.
Teachers were trained in écoles normales. To this day, the mighty
education ministry sets standardised curriculums and time-
tables. All 11-year-olds spend exactly four-and-a-half hours on
maths a week. Experimentation is frequently regarded as sus-
pect. “Classes are not laboratories,” noted a report by the conser-
vative education inspectorate a few years ago, “and pupils are
not guinea pigs.”

Yet “in reality our standardising system is unequal,” says
Mr Blanquer. By the age of 15, 40% of French pupils from poorer
backgrounds are “in diﬃculty”, a ﬁgure six percentage points
above the OECD average. French schools, with their demanding
academic content and testing, do well by the brightest children,
but often fail those at the bottom. France is an “outlier”, says Eric
Charbonnier, an OECD education specialist, because in contrast
to most countries, inequality in education has actually increased
over the past decade. Trouble starts in the ﬁrst year of primary
school, when children move abruptly from ﬁnger-painting in
maternelle (nursery) to sitting in rows learning to read and write.
Weaker pupils quickly get left behind and ﬁnd it hard to catch up. 
Mr Macron and Mr Blanquer have put reform of primary
education at the centre of their policy to combat school failure
and improve life chances. Halving class sizes is just the start. Mr
Blanquer, a former director of Essec, a highly regarded business
school, has thought about what works abroad and how such les-
sons might be applied in France. He is keen on autonomy and ex-
perimentation, which puts the teaching profession on edge.
French education has long been run along almost military lines.
An army of 880,000 teachers is deployed to schools across the
country. Head teachers have no say in staﬃng. In the course of
their careers, teachers acquire points that enable them to request
reassignment. Newly qualiﬁed ones without such points are
sent to the toughest schools, and turnover in such places is de-
pressingly high.
During the election campaign Mr Macron promised to give
schools more autonomy over teaching methods, timetabling
and recruitment, and to stop newly qualiﬁed teachers from be-
ing sent to the toughest schools. Yet greater freedom for schools
to experiment will require a big change in thinking. Only just
over 20% of French teachers adjust their methods to individual
ability, compared with over 65% of those in Norway. 
At the other end of the education ladder, a hint of just how
creative independent French education can be is found inside a
boxy building on the inner edge of northern Paris. This is 42, a

8

coding school. It is named after the number that is the “answer to
the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything”, ac-
cording to Douglas Adams’s science-ﬁction classic, “The Hitch-
hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”. The entrance hall at 42 is all dis-
tressed concrete and exposed piping. There is a skateboard rack
and a painting of a man urinating against a graﬃti-sprayed wall. 

Metaphysics and mer itocracy

42 is everything that traditional French higher education is
not. It is entirely privately ﬁnanced by Mr Niel, the entrepreneur,
but free to pupils. It holds no classes, has no ﬁxed terms or time-
tables and does not issue formal diplomas. All learning is done
through tasks on screen, at students’ own pace; “graduates” are
often snapped up by employers before they ﬁnish. There are no
lectures, and the building is open round the clock. The school is
hyper-selective and has a dropout rate of 5%. When it opened in
2013, Le Monde, a newspaper, described it as “strange”. “We’re not
about the transmission of knowledge,” says Nicolas Sadirac, the
director. “We are co-inventing computer science.” He likes to call
42 an art school. 
On a weekday morning Guillaume Aly politely takes oﬀ his
headphones to answer questions as he arrives at 42. He was in
the army for eight years before he applied, and went to school in
Seine-Saint-Denis, a nearby banlieue, or outer suburb, where job-
lessness is well above the national average. “I’m 30 years old,
and you don’t have much hope of training at my age,” he says.
But 42 shows a deliberate disregard for social background or
exam results. It tests applicants anonymously online, then se-
lects from a shortlist after a month-long immersion. Each year
50,000-60,000 people apply and just 900 are admitted. Léonard
Aymard, originally from Annecy, was a tour guide when he ap-
plied. Loic Shety, from Dijon, won a place even though he lacked
the school-leaving baccalauréat certiﬁcate. “It’s not for every-
one,” says Mathilde Allard from Montpellier, “but we work to-
gether so we don’t get lost.”
Across the river Seine, on the capital’s chic left bank, the
University of Paris-Descartes is a world
away from 42. It is based in a late-18th-cen-
tury building. Home to one of the most
prestigious medical schools in France, it is
highly sought after by the capital’s bright-
est, and is a world-class centre of research
in medical and life sciences. Yet a glimpse
at Descartes also shows how French high-
er education can tie the hands of innova-
tors, including the university’s president,
Frédéric Dardel, a molecular biologist. 
Like universities the world over, Des-
cartes receives far more applications than
it has places available. Yet unlike universi-
ty heads in other countries, Mr Dardel is
not permitted to select undergraduate stu-
dents. Ever since Napoleon set up the bac-
calauréat, which is awarded by the educa-
tion ministry, this exam has served not so
much as a school-leaving diploma but as
an entrance ticket to university, where tu-
ition fees are negligible. Students can ap-
ply for any course they like, regardless of
their ability. A centralised system allo-
cates Mr Dardel’s students to his institu-
tion. This
routinely overﬁlls certain
courses and causes overﬂowing lecture
halls. When a university cannot take any
more, those at schools nearby are sup-

posed to be given priority, but such is the demand that places are
increasingly being allocated through random selection by com-
puter, known as tirage au sort, which this year aﬀected 169 degree
subjects across France. Ability is immaterial. “It’s an absurd dis-
tribution system which leads to failure,” says Mr Dardel. He cal-
culates that the average dropout rate at Descartes over the past
six years has been 45%. 
Not all universities can be like 42. Mr Dardel admires the
coding school but argues that there is still a place for theoretical
maths in computer science. In year three, the computing degree
at Descartes still puts a heavy emphasis on mathematical theory.
Without the right to select those who attend, too many students
fail, breeding disillusion and waste. In 2014, 81 of the 268 students
allocated to the maths and computing course at Descartes did
not have the bac “S”, the maths-heavy version of the school-leav-
ing exam. After the ﬁrst year as undergraduates, only two of
those 81 passed their exams. 
“We have a tendency in France to think you need a single
solution for everyone,” says Mr Sadirac at 42. The lessons of his
school, as well as of Descartes and Oran-Constantine, point a
way for France to overcome the tyranny of normal in order to
make more of what it does well and minimise what it does not.
There is plenty of thinking about how to break free from
standardisation and make teaching more individualised with-
out losing excellence. France’s own world-class grandes écoles, its
business and engineering colleges, which do well in internation-
al rankings, are highly selective, but they serve only about 8% of
the student population. The challenge is to persuade public opin-
ion, students, parents and teachers that variety, autonomy and
experimentation are not a threat to equality but a means of re-
storing it to an education system that has lost sight of it. If Mr
Macron can do this, he will have gone a long way towards im-
proving the lot of people in places like the Calais housing estates
whom the system currently fails. 7

The regions

Double fracture

From vibrant cities to toxic banlieues and rural
deserts

“IT’S SIMPLE UNTIL you make it complicated”, reads a post-
er pinned to the wall of the hangout room. Purple and green
cushions on the sofa are printed with other injunctions, such as
“Less meeting, more doing”. There are deckchairs, coﬀee ma-
chines, a ﬁgure of Yoda from “Star Wars” and other must-have ac-
cessories of the startup oﬃce. The main concession to local cul-
ture, says Jérôme Vuillemot, a tech entrepreneur in Lyon, is a
table-football game, a staple of the French café. In 2013 he co-
founded Vidcoin, which uses zero-latency technology to allow
advertising videos on mobile screens to launch instantly. Today
the Lyon ﬁrm employs 20 people and has 75m users a month
worldwide. Its biggest market is America. 
Lyon is a thriving, cosmopolitan regional city that feels at
ease with change. Between 2008 and 2015, a period when unem-
ployment rose across the country, the net number of jobs there
increased by 5%. It enjoys fast trains and slow food, and got a
bike-sharing scheme long before Paris or London. Perched at the
conﬂuence of the Rhône and the Saône is a futuristic new plate-
glass museum. Along the quay an experimental driverless bus

conveys passengers to and fro. A startup incubator is being ﬁtted
in an old boiler factory.
As many as 84% of Lyon’s voters backed Mr Macron for
president. The city’s aﬃnity with him is not coincidental. In
many ways it is a laboratory for his politics. Gérard Collomb, its
mayor from 2001 until he became interior minister in May, was
one of Mr Macron’s earliest supporters. He ran the city by build-
ing a majority across the political divide, showing that this was
possible well before LRM was launched. “We’ve done this for a
long time and it feels quite normal here,” says David Kimelfeld,
who replaced Mr Collomb as mayor of Greater Lyon. Mr Col-
lomb, a Socialist, is also unapologetic about backing business.
The city retains a heavy industrial base, but has built new
strengths in robotics, life sciences and clean tech. “Lyon used to
feel like a provincial town,” says Mr Bonnell, founder of a local
robotics ﬁrm and one of Mr Macron’s new deputies. “Now it
could become France’s Shanghai.”
Lyon’s breezy conﬁdence is echoed in a string of other
French regional cities, including Lille, Grenoble, Montpellier,
Toulouse, Rennes, Nantes and Bordeaux, the last of which is now
only two hours from Paris by TGV. These metropolitan centres,
criss-crossed by shiny trams and well supplied with smoothie
bars and co-working spaces, are the new urban face of a country
whose geography was famously summed up as “Paris and the
French Desert”, the title of a book by Jean-François Gravier pub-
lished in 1947. In the second-round presidential vote Mr Macron
scored a massive 90% in Paris, 88% in Rennes and 86% in Bor-
deaux. Such places are at ease with his business-friendly global-
ism. Another side of France is not.

On the front line

Travel 10km (six miles) east of Lyon, to Décines-Charpieu,
home to the brand-new Groupama stadium for the Olympique
Lyonnais football club, and Mr Macron’s second-round majority
begins to taper oﬀ. Continue for another 10km, beyond the city’s
airport to the town of Colombier-Saugnieu, and it disappears.
Here, Ms Le Pen secured 57% of the vote. Carry on up over the

oured plant pots were installed in front of one concrete parade of
shops, where men gather at shaded tables outside a kebab res-
taurant. Unemployment in Vaulx-en-Velin, at 20%, is still twice
the national average. Nearly two in ﬁve adults have no school-
leaving certiﬁcate. In the ﬁrst round of the presidential election,
the far-left Mr Mélenchon came top there. The abstention rate
was nearly twice the national average.
Such intractable problems, powerfully captured over the
years by French ﬁlms from Mathieu Kassovitz’s angry “La Haine”
(1995) to Céline Sciamma’s tender “Bande de Filles” (2014), re-
quire an urgent policy response. Mr Macron’s labour reform may
help if more ﬁrms create stable entry-level jobs, particularly for
the young. Smaller primary classes in such areas will improve
schools in the long run. Mr Macron’s planned overhaul of the in-
eﬃcient training system could also help (France oﬀers only half
as many apprenticeships as Germany). Some also see enterprise
as a way out. “Digital can be a tool to overcome discrimination,”
says Mounir Mahjoubi, a former entrepreneur and now digital
minister, explaining that the trouble he had getting a job helped
persuade him to launch his own startup. 
There are other reasons for worrying about the toxic mix
found in France’s banlieues. “They represent a collective failure,”
says Amine El-Khatmi, a deputy mayor in Avignon, “because we
are losing a generation.” He notes a growing discourse of victimi-
sation in certain quarters among French-born children of immi-
grants who are rejecting France. This is the sort of message, ar-
gues Gilles Kepel, a scholar of Islam, that is used by jihadists to
recruit on French soil. Home to some 5m Muslims, France has
supplied more such ﬁghters to Syria and Iraq than any other
European country, and has been more battered by terrorist at-
tacks since 2015. 
Such matters are politically delicate in France, partly be-
cause they challenge its strict version of secularism known as laï-
cité. Entrenched by law in 1905 after a prolonged anticlerical
struggle, this creed keeps religion in all its forms out of public af-
fairs. Some mayors used it to ban the “burkini”, a body-covering
swimsuit, before being overruled in the courts. Yet some cam-
paigners for women’s rights also argue that laïcité is not being en-
forced in ways that protect their freedom. “The growing number
of veiled women reﬂects the investment of Islamists,” Nadia
Ould-Kaci, of Women of Aubervilliers against the Veil, told the
Senate recently. She says that in some neighbourhoods women
are not welcome in certain cafés, and eating out during Ramadan
has become “very dangerous”. Behind such conservative pres-
sure, researchers see the hand of well-organised Salaﬁst move-
ments. David Thomson, the author of the most comprehensive
study of French jihadists who returned home after going abroad
to ﬁght, says that many of his subjects were drawn ﬁrst to the Sa-
laﬁst doctrine of rupture with French society.
This is a daunting problem. The Catholic University of Lyon
oﬀers a government-backed diploma in religious freedom and
secularism in French, designed especially for imams from
abroad, but not enough people sign up. Over mint tea at the Oth-
mane mosque, near Vaulx-en-Velin, Azzedine Gaci, its imam and
a local pioneer of inter-religious dialogue who also teaches part
of this course, says that mosques ﬁnd it diﬃcult to reach teen-
agers at an age when they are asking searching questions about
being Muslim in France. 
The government’s attempts have fared little better. France’s
experiments with deradicalisation have been disappointing, no-
tably in its prisons. Pre-emptive intelligence is considered a far
better tool. French security services frequently foil home-grown
terrorist plots. Mr Macron has set up a new counter-terrorism co-
ordinating committee, reporting directly to him. But France, like
other European countries, is up against big numbers, small and

Crémieu plateau, which looks out towards the Alps, and down
to the village of Briord, with its single main road, café-bar-tabac
and car mechanic, and you reach deep Le Pen country. She came
top in ﬁrst-round voting in the surrounding department of l’Ain.
In the run-oﬀ, 61% of Briord’s voters backed her for president.
Ms Le Pen’s territory is the France of anxiety and neglect.
For decades, her party’s support base has relied on two strong-
holds: the Mediterranean fringe (its traditional base), and the in-
dustrial rustbelt of the north and east, both areas with historical-
ly high levels of immigration and unemployment. Ms Le Pen’s
vote correlates closely with measures of social distress, notably
joblessness and lack of qualiﬁcations. In the presidential ﬁrst
round 37% of working-class voters backed Ms Le Pen, 24% Mr Mé-
lenchon and just 16% Mr Macron. 
The most startling change since 2011, when Ms Le Pen took
over the party her father founded in 1972, has been the FN’s push
into small rural communities, notes Hervé Le Bras, a geographer.
In 1995 the FN secured its highest scores in inner suburbs 20-
30km from the centre of big cities. Now that spot has shifted to
40-50km away, where pavements give way to farmland. An anal-
ysis by Mr Le Bras and Jérôme Fourquet, a pollster, shows that the
FN vote is closely associated with the absence of services such as
a pharmacy, bakery, post oﬃce or café. This “France of the forgot-
ten” was zealously courted by Ms Le Pen, who played a classic
populist hand, appealing to ordinary people’s sense that the elite
was neglecting them, and promising to evict the establishment
“in the name of the people”, her campaign slogan. She held more
rallies in villages than she did in big cities. 
Mr Macron may have defeated Ms Le Pen, but the reasons
for the FN’s surge have not disappeared. Some 10.6m French vot-
ers backed her in the second round, nearly twice as many as sup-
ported her father in 2002. Mr Macron’s liberal internationalism
does not speak to such places, and public policy oﬀers few reme-
dies. The best of them focus on désenclavement, or breaking the
sense of isolation, by improving public services such as bus
links, family doctors and high-speed broadband coverage in
such areas. But these are ﬂimsy counter-forces to populism.

Across the tracks

Like all big French cities, Lyon is suﬀering from a second
fracture. Beyond the city’s ring road lies Vaulx-en-Velin, an angu-
lar banlieue originally built to house people recruited from north
Africa, Spain and Portugal for the textile industry and public
works. Vaulx-en-Velin became nationally known for riots there
in 1990. Since then, huge sums have been pumped into renovat-
ing the place. Brutalist tower blocks were demolished, young
trees were planted and park benches put in. Huge, brightly col-

shifting cells, and low-tech operations such as knife attacks and
the use of vehicles to mow down pedestrians. They are all but
impossible to prevent. The French intelligence services’ terro-
rism watch list contains 12,000 people. 
In the long run Mr Macron’s labour and education reforms
could help to combat exclusion in the banlieues, but that will take
time. Faster-acting schemes might include a promise to introduce
a month’s compulsory military service to encourage a sense of
national belonging. Mr Macron’s central short-term proposal is a
new counter-terrorism bill to bring an end to France’s state of
emergency in November, two years after it was ﬁrst declared. 
Lyon’s double fracture is a reminder that, for all the opti-
mism Mr Macron’s victory has rekindled in metropolitan folk,
the threat of populism, and the dark fascination with political Is-
lam, both remain potent. Each will continue, in its own way, to
lure some of those who have been angered, disillusioned or re-
pelled by liberal Western society. And both raise intractable poli-
cy challenges. As Mr Thomson says of radicalisation: “The reality
is that nobody knows how to solve the problem.” 7

France in Europe

A certain idea

That crucial Franco-German axis 

“IN EVERY BEGINNING dwells a certain magic.” Ger-
many’s Angela Merkel quoted these lines from a poem by
Hermann Hesse when she welcomed Mr Macron to Berlin the
day after his inauguration. The doyenne of European leaders, she
was by then on her fourth French president, having worked ﬁrst
with Mr Chirac in 2005. The link with her second, Mr Sarkozy,
was volatile; with Mr Hollande, lopsided. The election of Mr
Macron, who praised Germany for “rescuing our collective dig-
nity” during the refugee crisis and whose supporters waved EU
ﬂags at rallies, came as a relief and a source of promise. 
In his ﬁrst three months Mr Macron met Ms Merkel nine
times, more than twice as often as America’s and Italy’s leaders,
and three times more than Russia’s and Britain’s. This reﬂects a
return to the traditional European reﬂex of French presidents
during the Fifth Republic. It was General de Gaulle and Konrad
Adenauer, his German counterpart, who established the Franco-
German link as the driving force of Europe when they met in 1963
to sign a treaty under the crystal chandeliers of the Elysée Palace.
“My heart overﬂows and my soul is grateful,” averred the gen-
eral, adding that the treaty “opens the door to a new future for
Germany, for France, for Europe and therefore for the world”. 
Mr Macron would probably echo that sentiment. He twice
took his election campaign to Germany. His ﬁnance minister is a
ﬂuent German-speaker. His prime minister was educated at the
French Lycée in Bonn. His diplomatic adviser, Philippe Etienne,
was formerly ambassador to Berlin. Whatever the question in
Europe, the ﬁrst answer for Mr Macron seems to be Germany.
It is clear what Mr Macron seeks from the “new deal” he
hopes to reach with his neighbour. He summed it up three years
ago: “€50bn of spending cuts for us; €50bn of investment for
them.” A fuller version goes something like this: France restores
its lost credibility in German eyes by sticking to its promises to
curb the budget deﬁcit and reform the economy; in return, Ger-
many supports closer integration of the 19-member euro zone,

with more ﬁscal convergence and joint investment, some form
of common budget, a ﬁnance minister and a parliament. 
Mr Macron’s ﬁrst step is to keep to his word at home. “He
will surprise them, because the Germans don’t believe it will
happen,” says an adviser. “They have been disappointed by
France too many times before.” It will take some time before
judgment in Berlin ﬁrms up and the new German government
settles. But once they start talking seriously, the hard part will be-
gin. A foretaste was provided by the cover of Der Spiegel, a Ger-
man weekly, just days after the French election. It featured Mr
Macron under the heading “Teurer Freund”—which can mean ei-
ther dear or expensive friend. When France talks about more
risk-sharing, Germany hears bigger bills to pay. When Germany
insists on more control and rules, France hears refusal to accept
solidarity. As a frequent visitor, Mr Macron knew Germany well
enough not to push too soon. He took care to start with less con-
troversial matters, such as the protection of external borders, be-
fore pressing for new euro-zone institutions. But his underlying
strategy is clear: the more reason that France can give Germany
to trust it, the more it can hope to get from Berlin.
Mr Macron senses an unusual—and probably brief—oppor-
tunity for Europe to fashion a stronger centre and stand up for it-
self in the world. In this respect, he can sound almost impatient
with his mighty neighbour. “Germany is faced with a real choice:
whether it wants a European model with a German hegemony
which isn’t durable, because it rests in part on courageous re-
forms that Germany did a dozen years ago, and in part on the im-
balances in the euro zone…or whether Germany wants to partic-
ipate with France in a new European leadership which
rebalances Europe, with more solidarity and also a project of
stronger convergence.” He has no illusions about the price of fail-
ure. The choice, he judges, is about whether liberal democratic
politics can prevail, and whether Europe can hold together.
Most world leaders do not fret much about their place in
history until towards the end of their tenure. Unusually for a
young ﬁrst-time president, Mr Macron already seems to be pon-
dering it. He chose to place a copy of de Gaulle’s memoirs, to-
gether with a ticking clock, in the background of his oﬃcial por-
trait. Behind his outwardly sunny disposition there is both a
single-mindedness and an inner solemnity about him. With
America’s president, Donald Trump, tempted by isolation and
morally adrift, Britain in retreat and illiberal powers on the con-
tinent’s doorstep, Mr Macron sees this as Europe’s moment to re-
assert itself and its values as a guarantor of the democratic liberal
order, but also as a place that se-
cures decent lives for its people.
“Europe needs to wake up. We
need to stop holding crisis sum-
mits around hyper-technical
subjects…We need to deﬁne
another horizon together. We
can be the leaders of tomor-
row’s world.” 
As Mr Macron’s presiden-
cy unfolds, there are bound to
be misunderstandings, quar-
rels and disappointments. He
wants a Europe “of diﬀerent
speeds”, centred on the euro
zone. Yet countries outside the
currency area will resent being
treated as second-class. His fo-
cus on the Franco-German rela-
tionship risks sidelining the
rest, whether old friends or

2 newer members in eastern Europe. He will rattle some with his
call for a “Europe that protects”. To northern European ears, this
smacks of old-style French protectionism and cuts against the
principles of the EU’s single market. When Mr Macron’s govern-
ment nationalised a French shipyard this summer, albeit tempo-
rarily, in order to thwart an Italian takeover, he caused dismay
not only in Rome but also in other European capitals. Maybe,
muttered some, the new president is not as European as he pro-
fesses to be. Mindful of such risks, Mr Macron has since taken a
tour of eastern European capitals, which France has too often ig-
nored, and invited Italy and Spain to join France and Germany at
a summit in Paris. 
To make sense of Mr Macron’s views on Europe, it is best to
avoid casting him as an Anglo-Saxon liberal. That he calls him-
self liberal at all is courageous in France (Mr Chirac once de-
scribed liberalism as a greater threat to Europe than commu-
nism). During his campaign Mr Macron made the case for
globalisation and free trade, whereas Ms Le Pen promised to put
up barriers and shut out foreign competition. But “he is not the
product of a liberal intellectual tradition,” says Mathieu Laine, a
liberal analyst, friend and early backer of his presidential bid.
“His roots are on the progressive centre-left that reconciled itself
to the market economy.” 

Capitalism edged in pink

“I believe in the market economy, the open world,” ex-
plains Mr Macron, “but we need to rethink regulation, so as to
deal with the excesses of globalised capitalism.” Right or wrong,
he judges such excesses to be behind Britain’s vote for Brexit. This
directly informs his vision of the EU. “Europe is not a supermar-
ket,” he declared in June. “He believes that if you want to keep a
society open, you have to protect it,” says an adviser. The presi-
dent fears that, unless Europe can oﬀer security to its citizens as
well as open up opportunities for them, political extremism will
win the day and Europe will fail. 
If he gets it right, he could reap big dividends. Germany
needs a stronger France to help share the burden of EU leader-
ship. Both countries fret about Mr Trump’s disdain for NATO and
want to strengthen European defence co-operation. Post-war
Germany has never been comfortable with the idea of being Eu-
rope’s sole leader, and remains tentative about using force
abroad. Britain is distracted by self-inﬂicted diﬃculties. If Brexit

goes ahead as planned, France, a
permanent member of the UN
Security Council and a nuclear
power, will be the EU’s only
member with military muscle.
Despite a squeeze on military
spending, Mr Macron plans to
raise the defence budget to 2% of
GDP by 2025. With luck, he
could look forward to a second
term and a big role in Europe. 
It is too early to judge how
Mr Macron might be able to pro-
ject such inﬂuence. He is deft at
using diplomatic symbols, invit-
ing Mr Putin to Versailles, while
making it clear that he will be no
pushover. But he is new to for-
eign and security policy, and un-
tested as commander-in-chief.
“He doesn’t want to lock himself
into a doctrine, which is a good
thing,” says François Heisbourg,
of the Foundation for Strategic
Research, a think-tank. 
Mr Macron’s emerging di-
plomacy seems to rest on prag-
matism: a belief in keeping the
door open to all-comers, even
unsavoury ones, on the premise
that isolation breeds even great-
er danger. Mr Macron rejects
what he calls “neo-conservatism”: the idea that Western powers
can impose democracy and the rule of law on authoritarian
sovereign states. He calls the intervention in Libya in 2011 a “his-
toric error”. And he believes ardently that France can recover a
global voice and maintain a capacity to back it with force. He
watched with dismay as the West failed to punish Syria for using
chemical weapons in 2013. If Syria does so again on his watch, he
warns, he will act unilaterally. 
France has entered territory that is both promising and un-
charted. There is no guarantee of success. Mr Macron is bound to
disappoint some and upset others. His re-
solve will be tested as people wake up to
uncomfortable change and his popularity
drops further. His parliamentary novices
will occasionally stumble. The future of
LRM as a party remains fragile. Yet the
broad direction is right. By sticking to it, Mr
Macron could begin to remove some of
the historic shackles on growth in France,
and in Europe more broadly. 
Those inclined to carp at the young
president’s mistakes might also take a look
at the cast of career politicians who were
swept aside by his bold advance, and re-
call how close to darkness the country
came. Getting it right in France, a proud
and volatile nation, is never simple. But
the omens have seldom been as favour-
able, nor the stakes as high. If Mr Macron
fails, the odds will be on a President Mé-
lenchon or Le Pen in 2022, and a disinte-
grating Europe. That is why he is his coun-
try’s, and his continent’s, best hope. 7

Whatever
the question
in Europe,
the ﬁrst
answer for
Mr Macron
seems to be
Germany

In Julygun-men ambushed MrMagaqa and two othercouncillorsfrom the African National Con-gress(ANC), South Africa’srulingparty, astheysatin a car. (MrMagaqa died in hospi-tal on September4th.) Three otherANCpoliticiansfrom the same area weregunned down between April and May.Acrossthe province, there have been atleast40 politicallymotivated killings sincethe startof2016.Mostofthe violence hasoccurred with-in the ANC, which issteeped in corruptionatall levels.

Two months lat-ershe wasdisqualiﬁed from the election,held in August, on dubioustechnicalgrounds. Butshe continued to speakoutagainstPresidentPaul Kagame, who hasbeen in charge ofRwanda since 1994. Sothismonth the governmenttried a newtactic, detainingMsRwigara—and hermotherand sister—foralleged taxevasion.She hassince been charged with “oﬀencesagainststate security”.MsRwigara’sexperience ishardlyun-ique. These daysmanygovernmentsthatwantto cowtheircriticsare aslikely to usethe taxman asthe secretpolice. Such tac-ticsare notconﬁned to Africa. The Russianand Chinese governmentsoften use com-plicated taxrulesto intimidate orpunishdissidents. Norare theyentirelynew. Dan-iel arap Moi, Kenya’sdictatoruntil 2002,turned histaxcollectorsinto scourges ofthe opposition. Butpoliticallymotivatedarrestson tax-related chargesseem to beincreasingin Africa.Take Zambia, where mostofthe mediafavoured EdgarLungu, the president, in theelection lastyear. Apunchytabloid calledthe Poststood apart—until the Zambia Rev-enue Authorityshutitdown, sayingitowed some $6m in unpaid taxes. In April,although the Postwasstill appealingthedecision, the taxman auctioned the pa-per’sassets. Similarly, in Kenya, two NGOsthatmulled challengingthe resultsof theelection lastmonth were temporarilyshutdown overalleged taximproprieties. Theiroﬃceswere raided bypolice and revenueoﬃcials. The resultsofthe presidential pollwere neverthelessannulled bythe su-preme court.“Thiskind ofheavy-handed thingusedto happen in Kenya in the 1990s, so it’sjustareturn to targeted oppression,” saysJohnGithongo, the directorofAfriCOG, one ofthe targeted NGOs. “The momentyouas-sociate with the opposition youﬁnd your-selfunderaudit.” (MrGithongo isa formercorrespondentforThe Economist.) In theDemocraticRepublicofCongo, where theauthoritiesrarelycollecttaxesfrom smallbusinesses, Martin Fayuluofthe opposi-tion Rassemblementalliance saysthat ahotel he ownshasbeen repeatedlyshutdown overallegedlyunpaid taxes.African taxauthoritieshave gotbetteratcollection—and notjustfrom govern-mentcritics. In the 1990s, underpressurefrom donorsand the IMF, manycountriesestablished autonomousrevenue authori-ties. Electronicpaymentisnowcommon.Accordingto data from the UN, between1992 and 2012 taxesgenerated acrossthecontinentfrom sourcesotherthan naturalresourcesincreased from 12% to 15% ofGDP.Butthe expectation ofhigherrevenuescould be exacerbatingthe problem. In Ken-ya, asthe economyslows, the revenue au-thorityis“undera lotofpressure to collectalmostunattainable amounts”, saysNikhilHira ofDeloitte Kenya, a consultancy. Thetaxman’sjob ismade harderbythe factthatbusinessesowned byleadingpoliti-ciansand theircroniesseem to payno taxatall in manycountries. The politicisation oftaxesisundermin-ingtrustin the collectors. “There isstill averywidespread perception thattaxpay-ingiscorruptand arbitrary,” saysMickMoore ofthe Institute ofDevelopmentStudies, a British research outﬁt. In the longrun, conspicuouslyvindictive taxraidswill make itharderforgovernmentstoraise revenue. 7The taxman as a tool of repressionBeware thetaxmanNAIROBIRevenue authorities are the latesttoolsofrepression in Africa“THISisa generational cause,” saysBobi Wine, backin hisstudio afteralongdayin parliament.

Nowhe isthe spokesman forUgan-da’sfrustrated youth in a struggle to stopYoweri Museveni, the actual president,from extendinghisrule. “All the powerhasbeen packed into the presidency,” he says.“We wantto take itbackto the people.”MrMuseveni used to saysimilarthingshimself, blamingAfrica’sproblemson“leaderswho wantto overstayin power”.Butafter31yearsatthe top he haschangedhismind. Politiciansin hisrulingparty aretryingto scrap a clause in the constitutionwhich sayscandidatesmustbe no olderthan 75 to run forpresident. The goal is toletMrMuseveni, 73, stand again in 2021—and probablyrule forlife.There were ﬁst-ﬁghtsand ﬂying chairson September26th asMrMuseveni’ssup-porterstried to startthe processin parlia-ment.

The mayorofKampala, the capital, who opposesthe bill,wasarrested in the middle ofa televisioninterviewand bundled into a police van.Thisisnotthe “fundamental change”thatMrMuseveni promised when he tookpowerin 1986 atthe head ofa rebel army.He restored stabilityto mostofthe country,which had been torn apartbydictatorshipand war. Simeo Nsubuga, an NRM MP,saysUgandansshould be grateful to MrMuseveni forending“20 yearsofturmoil,suﬀeringand killings”. Manyare. Butfouroutofﬁve Ugandansare too youngto re-memberthose days. Instead, the youngcomplain aboutcrumblingservicesand too fewjobs. Forthe ﬁrstquarter-centuryunderMrMuse-veni growth in income perperson aver-aged 3% a year; in the pastﬁve yearsit hasbeen just1%. Yetfewdare take theirgriev-ancesto the streets. Even the young“liveunderthe canopyofhistory”, notesAnge-lo Izama, a local pundit.

The age-limit clauseis“the lastremainingcheckto ensure an or-derlysuccession”, saysFrederickSsem-pebwa, a lawyerwho helped draftthe con-stitution.

In therun-up to the promised ballot, Catalonia istense. Butoﬃcialsare conﬁdentthat theyhave prevented anythingresemblingtheorganised vote thatCarlesPuigdemont,the Catalan president, intended to delivera“binding” result.

On the or-dersofa Barcelona prosecutor, a dozen keyCatalan oﬃcialswere arrested (and laterfreed) and 9.8m ballotpapersseized.

MrMacron campaignedon a promise to shake up France and to do hisbestto repeat thetrickin the EU. ButduringGermany’spedestrian election cam-paign MrsMerkel neithersoughtnorobtained a mandate for aEuropean overhaul. Manyofhervoterssee no reason for it.ThisweekMrMacron’svision forEurope found itsfullest ex-pression yet, with a sweeping100-minute addressatthe Sor-bonne thattookin everythingfrom defence co-operation to agri-cultural subsidies—the third rail ofFrench politics—andculminated in a plan fora ﬁve-year“transformation” ofthe EU be-tween 2019 and 2024, the yearin which, notcoincidentally, Pariswill hostthe OlympicGames. Hisriposte to those who found allthisa little hastywasdelivered in full Macronese: “Procrastina-tion”, the presidentproclaimed, “isthe cousin oflanguor.” Itwasstirringstuﬀ, ifa little dirigiste formany: MrMacron’scallsforcor-porate-taxharmonisation, orfora single marketbased on “con-vergence ratherthan competition”, will jangle nervesin liberal-minded cornersofEurope. Still, MrMacron’sproposalsmaynowform the starting-pointfordiscussion amongthe EU’sleaders,who were preparingto meetin Estonia asThe Economistwenttopress. “MrMacron”, saysone EU oﬃcial, “hasstolen the show.”Itisimpossible to imagine MrsMerkel makingthisspeech.The chancellorhasdominated the EU notbypursuinganythingso marvellousasa vision, butbyplacingherself, and the cloutofthe large countryshe runs, atthe heartofeach ofthe crisesthe EUhasbattled, while otherleaders, includingsuccessive Frenchpresidents, have retired hurt.

Thenotion thatGermany’selection resultmakesMrMacron’slifemuch harderisan overstatement—butthatisbecause there wasno conceivable coalition thatwould have bowed before his de-mands. Still, hisroom foroperation iseven lessthan it was. Hav-ingsuccessfullycarved outa mildlyEuroscepticniche, the pro-marketFree Democrats(FDP), one ofMrsMerkel’sexpected part-ners, will exacta price on EU policyduringthe coalition talks. Thatdoesnotmean MrMacron isdoomed to achieve nothingatall. He urged renewal ofthe Élysée Treaty, the compact thathasgoverned Franco-German relationsforoverhalfa century, andhad lotsto sayon migration and security, preoccupations in Ber-lin thatmightform the basisforan earlyFranco-German deal(though a stitch-up risksalienatingothermembers). Some detailswill rankle, butMrMacron’soverarchingvision, ofa Europe thatdefangspopulistsbyprotectingitscitizensfrom the rougheredgesofglobalisation, isnotunpopularin Germany, and willface weakeropposition inside the EUonce Britain leaves. Sensibly, MrMacron chose notto presshisargumentthat theeuro zone needsrebuildingfrom the ground up, including a vastbudgetthathe haspreviouslysuggested should be worth severalpercentage pointsofeuro-zone GDP (the currentEU budgetisjust1.2%). Advancingthese claimsjustasGermany’spartieswere be-ginningto jostle forposition in coalition talkswould have back-ﬁred spectacularly; immediatelyafterthe election ChristianLindner, the FDP’sleader, ruled outsigningup to a bigeuro-zonebudget. No doubtMrMacron remainsconvinced thatthe curren-cyarea needsthe overhaul he promised duringhispresidentialcampaign. Buteven Jupiterknowswhen to stayhishand.This one weird trickcould ﬁxthe euro zoneMrMacron will still hope to obtain a foothold forprototypes ofhislesserideas: a small budgetforinvestments; a (rather titular)“ﬁnance minister” forthe euro zone; a tweakto itsbail-out fund.The European Commission, which hasplansofitsown, will testthe waterswith proposalsin December; the euro-zone’s19 lead-erswill chewthem overata summitsoon afterwards. Butthe real action maylie elsewhere. Five yearsago the eurozone agreed to establish a bankingunion. The resultswere im-pressive, butgovernmentshave failed to agree on all thescheme’selements, includinga European ﬁscal backstop to res-cue troubled banksand a common insurance scheme fordepos-its. Breakingthislogjam, ratherthan anyinstitutional jiggery-pok-ery, will be the ﬁrst, and best, testofwhetherFrance andGermanycan overcome theirdiﬀerencesto putthe single curren-cyon a more stable footing. Alongwith plansto deepen Europe’scapital markets, spreadingﬁnancial riskand breakingthe “doom-loop” between governmentsand banksoverburdened withsovereign debtmaydo much more forthe euro’sresilience than amodestbudgetora toothlessﬁnance minister. MrMacron did notmention the bankingunion thisweek: hewasseekingto inspire hislisteners, notputthem to sleep. Butheknowswell thatitwill take more than ﬁne wordsto overcomeGerman suspicionsthatthe French (and otherbudget-busters)simplywanttheirﬁscal recklessnesssubsidised bythe more fru-gal.

MrJohnson and Liam Fox, theinternational-trade secretary, chose thisofthe need fora transition period afterMarch 2019, when Brexitisdue to happen.Partlyto please Euroscepticsin herparty,she insisted thismustbe time-limited, butshe did notspecifyhowlongitwould lastbeyond the vague phrase “around twoyears”. She also made clearthatduring thisperiod currentarrangementswould apply,includingfree movementofpeople, accep-tance ofthe European CourtofJustice andpaymentsinto the EUbudget.Thatsetthe stage forherthird conces-sion, which wasovermoney.

La-bourand the Conservativesincreased theirshare ofthe voteto 82%, from 65% in 2005. Yetlooka little more closelyat the twogreatpartiesthatare currentlyholdingtheirannual conferences—Labourin Brighton thisweekand the Conservativesin Manches-ternext—and yousee a more complicated picture. UnderJeremyCorbyn, Labourisdivided into two sub-parties: a moderate So-cial DemocraticPartyand a socialistCorbynite Party. The Conser-vativesare an uneasycoalition ofWhigsand Tories.The Corbynite Partywasin charge in Brighton. Mostof thetrade unionistsand activistswho ﬁlled the hall were Corbynites,and Momentum, the molten core ofCorbynism, helped to put onaparallel conference, “The World Transformed”. Tom Watson, of-ﬁciallyLabour’sdeputyleaderand unoﬃciallyone ofthe com-mandersofthe anti-Corbyn resistance movement, even treatedthe conference to a rendition of“Oh, JeremyCorbyn”, the favour-ite chantofthe faithful, in an abjectadmission ofdefeat. ButtheSocial Democratswere neverthelessin evidence. Blairite MPswalked the seafrontwith rictussmiles. LabourFirst, a moderatepressure group, complained loudlythatthe lefthad stitched upthe conference bydenyingspeakingrolesto centrists, most nota-blySadiq Khan, the mayorofLondon (the organiserseventuallyrelented). One moderate complained thathe feltlike a stranger inhisown party. The sortofpeople who used to stand outside thehall handingoutleaﬂetswere nowinside.The Corbynitesand Social Democratsdiﬀerfundamentallyon the meaningofthe election, in which Labourdramatically in-creased itsvote-share butfell 64 seatsshortofa majority. LenMcCluskey, the leaderofthe pro-Corbyn Unite union, gave ventto the Corbynite interpretation when he told the conference thathe wastired of“whingersand whiners” who pointoutthatLa-bourdidn’twin. “I saywe did win. We won the heartsand mindsofmillionsofpeople, especiallythe young,” he insisted. MrCor-byn told a fringe meetingthatLabourwould have won outright ifthe campaign had lasted anotherweek. On thisanalysis, the tasknowisto workharderatsellingCorbynism to the people.The Social Democrats, meanwhile, believe thatLabourlost awinnable election bybackinga candidate and a setofpoliciesthatstand faroutside the mainstream. The psephological evi-dence pointsin both directions. MrCorbyn pulled oﬀa remark-able featbygetting40% ofthe vote. Buthispartyisrunning neck-and-neckwith the Conservativesin the polls, despite the factthatthe governmentisdoingitsbestto tearitselfapart. A more cen-tristpolitician could be leadingbydouble ﬁgures.The Conservatives’ Manchesterconference will be no lessconfusing. Itwill be shared bythe Whigs, a cosmopolitan partythatwantsBritain to remain asclose aspossible to Europe, andthe Tories, a nationalistpartythatworriesaboutimmigrationand cultural change. The Whigsare mostlyyoungand urban—Da-vid Cameron’sNottingHill setwritlarge—while the Tories areolderand rural. The Whigsthinkthe Conservative Party mustmove with the timesin orderto survive, whereasthe Tories thinkthatmovingwith the timeswill mean surrenderingeverythingtheyhold dear. Like the Corbynites, the Torieshave numbers ontheirside. The Conservative Partyenjoysimpregnable majoritiesin placeslike Hampshire East, buthasrecentlylostmetropolitanbeachheadssuch asKensington and Battersea.The Conservativesare justasdivided overthe meaning oftheelection asLabour. The ToriesthinkthatTheresa May’sstrategyofadvancinginto culturallyconservative working-class areasinthe north wasa brilliantidea badlyexecuted. The party cameclose to winninga slewofBrexit-votingseatssuch asBishopAuckland in north-eastEngland. The Whigsagree thatit wasbad-lyexecuted butthinkitwasa foolish idea in the ﬁrst place. Byem-bracingsocial conservatism and little-England nationalism, thepartyalienated metropolitan Britain withoutbreakingthe work-ingclass’stribal loyaltyto Labour.Conferences and after-partiesThese divisionsare notclear-cut. Some Conservative Brexiteers,such asDaniel Hannan, are radical Whigfree-traderswho likenthe EUto the protectionistCorn Lawsofthe 1840s.Some ofLa-bour’schiefSocial Democrats, such asMrKhan, have made ashowofbendingthe knee to MrCorbyn. The partyconferencesunderline the factthatpolitical partiesare asmuch social organ-ismsaspolitical ones: an excuse to getdrunk, have a good timeand hangoutwith friends. YetBrexitistestingpartymanagers’ skillsto the limit. In gov-ernment, the Conservativescannotavoid makingdivisive deci-sionsoverBrexit. The partyalso containsa core offanatics whohave no intention ofallowingthe triumph ofBrexitto be be-trayed. Labourisalso split. MrCorbyn iscool on Europe partlybe-cause, asa socialist, he regardsthe EU asa constrainton policiessuch asnationalisation and partlybecause, asa partyboss, he re-alisesthatmanyworking-classLabourvoterssupported Brexit.Bycontrast, Labour’sSocial Democratsare passionatelypro-EU.In Britain tribal loyaltiesusuallytrump ideological divisions.Butoccasionallyideological divisionsprove too wide to manage,particularlywhen allied with economicinterests. The Conserva-tiveshave splittwice because oftrade, ﬁrstoverthe Corn Lawsand then overimperial preference in the early20th century.Brexitmightyetprove to be justsuch a division. The Conserva-tives’ Whigsand Labour’sSocial Democratshave farmore incommon with each otheroverBrexit(and much else) than theydo with theirparties’ radical wings. One ofthe bigquestions ofthe nextyearwill be whethertribalism will prevail again—orwhetherthe Whigsand Social Democratscan summon the cour-age to reach acrossthe aisle and startvotingasa block on the all-consumingquestion ofBritain’srelationship with Europe. 7The four-partysystemLabourand the Conservatives are both divided.

Though itisnotthoughtthatthese caused hersuicide, herfamilyhassaid theygreatlydistressed her.Herdeath alerted the sectorto the pro-blem, saysPeterLewisofthe Institute ofFundraising, a trade group. Laterthat year,aftera governmentinquiry, a newcode ofconductbanned charitiesfrom passing ondonors’ data withoutexpresspermission.Charitiesacrossthe EU will face similarrulesfrom May2018. Charitieshave also been criticised forraisingexecutive paycloserto business lev-els. Taxdata showthatbetween 1988 and2014 the payofseniormanagementinAmerican non-proﬁtorganisations(in-cludinghospitalsand universities) rosetwice asfastasthatofotherstaﬀ—andtwice asfastastotal expenditure. Accord-ingto the Wall StreetJournal, in 2014 about2,700 American non-proﬁtexecutivesearned more than $1m a year. (Mostofthese ran bighospital groupsoruniversi-ties; a fewwere megapreachers.) Thoughan eﬀective bosscan be well worth a highsalary, some volunteersand donorsﬁndsuch high remuneration a turn-oﬀ. One ofthe biggestremainingdiﬀer-encesbetween charitiesand businesses isin accessto capital. Unlike a business, acharitycannotsell shares. Butfewhavesteadyincome streamsorvaluable assetsagainstwhich to borrow. Newtypesofcharitable ﬁnancingare startingto ﬁll thegap. “Impactinvesting”, in which thepromised return isa philanthropicout-come aswell as(orinstead of) a ﬁnancialone, hasboomed in recentyears. Forexam-ple, the W.K. KelloggFoundation hasbacked Acelero Learning, an early-yearseducation ﬁrm, and Revolution Foods, acompanyin California thatserveshealthylunchesin schoolsin hard-up areas.Anotheridea isfora third party to guar-antee a charity’sloan. In 2014 RootCapital,anon-proﬁtorganisation thatlendsmoneyto farmers, needed cash fora programmeto help coﬀee growersin Latin America.USAID, the international developmentarm ofthe American government, gave it aloan guarantee worth $15m. IfRootbor-rowed moneyand could notpayitback,USAID would make up some ofthe diﬀer-ence. Withoutthe riskofdefaultitwas ableto borrow$12.5m, includingfrom the FordFoundation and Starbucks.Loansto charities, like those to ﬁrmsorindividuals, can also be splitinto diﬀerenttranches. The slice with the highestriskand lowestreturnscan be taken byfounda-tionsorgovernmentagencies. Thismakesthe remainingslicesmore attractive to priv-ate lenders. Though such innovationsarepromising, theyremain a rarity.More businesslike charitiesshould bebetterequipped to survive and thrive.Theyshould also do more good. Alitera-ture reviewin 2014 byacademicsatthe Vi-enna UniversityofEconomicsand Busi-nessfound numerousstudiesshowingthatbetter-qualiﬁed managerswere asso-ciated with higherand more stable rev-enues. Butcharitiesalso face newcompeti-tion from a surprisingsource: the rise ofthecharitable business. In America corporate philanthropydoubled in real termsbetween 1990 and2015, to $18bn. Astudyof20 Europeancountriesshowed thatcorporationsgaveabout€22bn ($26bn) in 2013, more thanfoundationsdid. Though much ofthisﬂowed through charities, itestablishesbusinesses, in theircustomers’ minds, asentitiesthatcan have charitable aims.A“fourth sector” (afterpublic, privateand voluntary) isspringingup, consistingoforganisationsthatstraddle the line be-tween businessand charity. Theycallthemselves“low-proﬁtlimited liabilitycompanies”, “social enterprises” and oth-ernames. These range from buildersthatseekto make a proﬁtfrom housingpoorpeople to fashion labelsthatemploydis-abled people to design and sell handbags.Areportfrom the European Parliamentsuggeststhere are 200,000 in Britain,France, Spain, Italyand Poland.

Theshare ofnewappliancessold to replace de-fective ones(asopposed to ﬁrst-time pur-chases) in Germanyincreased from 3.5% in2004 to 8.3% in 2012, accordingto the Öko-Institut, a think-tank. Washingmachines,in particular, are hard to ﬁx. The most com-mon problem isthattheirbearingsfail;when these are sealed awayin the drum,repairerscannotaccessthem.To reverse the trend, butalso to defenditsindustry’sturf, the RepairAssociation, alobbygroup funded byrepairshopsaswell asbyenvironmental organisationsand othercharities, wantsstatesin Ameri-ca to pass“rightto repair” laws. Thesewould require ﬁrmsin all industries to pro-vide consumersand independentrepairshopswith the same service documenta-tion, toolsand spare partsthatthey makeavailable to authorised service providers.The hope isthatonce an importantstatepassessuch a law, the countrywill fol-low—aswasthe case in the carindustryafterMassachusettsin 2012 passed a right-to-repairlawforcarsthatled to a nationalmemorandum ofunderstandingbetweencarmakersand repairshops.Ifno bill hasbeen passed yet, it isbe-cause the RepairAssociation hasfaced stiﬀresistance from manufacturers.

Together withAaron Perzanowski ofCase Western Re-serve University, he haswritten a book,“The End ofOwnership”, which describesthe manywaysin which ﬁrmsnowlimitwhatpeople can do with the stuﬀthey buy,in particularlythe digital sort. “Owners”are often notallowed to resell it, transfer itto anotherdevicesormash itup with otherdigital goods.

Can technologyhelp?To fend oﬀshortages, mosttruck own-ershave done preciselywhateconomistssuggest, which isto increase pay. Driverscan nowcommand nearly40,000 rupees($610) a month, a decentwhite-collarwage—and notfarfrom double the level oftruckerpayjustthree yearsago. Rivigo, astartup based in Gurgaon, an industrialcitynearDelhi, isusinga diﬀerent roadmap.

MrGargsaysthatwithin a fewyearshe wantsRivigo to be outofthe business ofowningitsown trucks, and focused in-stead on organisingthe relayforwhichevertruckingﬁrm wishesto participate in it.The pitstop network, he says, costa mere$30m to setup, a fraction ofthe $115m ithasraised from investorssuch asWarburg Pin-cusand SAIFPartners, two private-equityﬁrms. Rumoursare swirlingofa whopping$200m investmentround led bySoftBank,aJapanese telecomsand internetgroup,which would turn Rivigo into a rare busi-ness-to-business“unicorn” startup valuedatover$1bn.Such a loftyvaluation raisesthe pos-sibilityoffarmore competition.

Con-versely, MrGargthinkshis“relayasa ser-vice” conceptmighthave applications inotherpartsofIndia’slogisticsmarkets—oroverseas.First, Rivigo will have to navigate trans-formation in India’sdomesticlogisticsin-dustry, which isworth around $300bn ayear.

Onshare trading, MiFID2 barsinvestmentbanksfrom directlyliningup buyersandsellersin theirdarkpools, and caps theamountof“dark” trading. To execute sharetradeson itsown account, a bankmust reg-isterasa “systematicinternaliser” (SI).High-frequencytradingﬁrms, which tradewith theirown capital, are setto beneﬁtfrom the expanded SIstatus. Thiswill en-able them forthe ﬁrsttime openlyto plyforbusinessfrom assetmanagers. Even in the familiarbusinessofsharetrading, implementation hasthrown upproblems. Financial institutionswrangledwith the regulator, the European Securitiesand MarketsAuthority(ESMA), overtheprecise scope ofan SI, which wasﬁnalisedonlyin August.

Butmostexpecta bumpyride. 7ASWITH London buses, don’tworryifyoumissa ﬁnancial crisis; anotherwill be alongshortly. The lateststudy onlong-term assetreturnsfrom DeutscheBankshowsthatcrisesin developed mar-ketshave become much more common inrecentdecades. Thatdoesnotbode well.Deutsche deﬁnesa crisisasa periodwhen a countrysuﬀersone ofthe follow-ing: a 15% annual decline in equities; a 10%fall in itscurrencyoritsgovernmentbonds; a defaulton itsnational debt; oraperiod ofdouble-digitinﬂation. Duringthe 19th century, onlyoccasionallydidmore than halfofcountriesforwhichthere are data suﬀersuch a shockin a sin-gle year. Butsince the 1980s, in numerousyearsmore than halfofthem have beenin a ﬁnancial crisisofsome kind.The main reason forthis, arguesDeut-sche, isthe monetarysystem. Under thegold standard and itssuccessor, the Bret-ton Woodssystem ofﬁxed exchangerates, the amountofcreditcreation waslimited. Acountrythatexpanded its mon-eysupplytoo quicklywould suﬀera tradedeﬁcitand pressure on itscurrency’sex-change rate; the governmentwould reactbyslammingon the monetarybrakes.The resultwasthatitwasharderfor ﬁnan-cial bubblesto inﬂate.Butsince the early1970smore coun-trieshave moved to a ﬂoatingexchange-rate system. Thisgivesgovernments theﬂexibilityto deal with an economic crisis,and meanstheydo nothave to subordi-nate otherpolicygoalsto maintaining acurrencypeg. Ithasalso created a trend to-wardsgreatertrade imbalances, which nolongerconstrain policymakers—the cur-rencyisoften allowed to take the strain.Similarly, governmentdebthasrisensteadilyasa proportion ofGDPsince themid-1970s. There hasbeen little pressurefrom the marketsto balance the budget;Japan hashad a deﬁciteveryyearsince1966, and France since 1993. Italyhasman-aged justone yearofsurplussince 1950. Inthe developed world, consumersand com-panieshave also taken on more debt.The resulthasbeen a cycle ofcredit ex-pansion and collapse. Debtisused to ﬁ-nance the purchase ofassets, and the great-eravailabilityofcreditpushesasset priceshigher. From time to time, however, lend-erslose faith in borrowers’ abilityto repayand stop lending; a ﬁre sale ofassets canfollow, furtherweakeningthe beliefin thecreditworthinessofborrowers. Central banksthen step in to cut inter-estratesor(since 2008) to buyassetsdi-rectly. Thisbringsthe crisisto a temporaryhaltbuteach cycle seemsto resultin higherdebtlevelsand assetprices. The chartshowsthatthe combined valuation ofbondsand equitiesin the developed worldishigherthan everbefore.All thissuggeststhatthe ﬁnancial sys-tem could be due anothercrisis. Deutschemakesseveral suggestionsatto whatmightcause one, from a debt-related crash in Chi-na, through the rise ofpopulistpoliticalpartiesto the problem ofilliquidity inbond markets. The mostlikelytriggerfora sell-oﬀ isthe withdrawal ofsupportbycentralbanks; afterall, the monetaryauthoritiesare generallycredited with havingsavedthe global economyand marketsin 2009.In America the Federal Reserve ispushingup interestratesand reducingthe size ofitsbalance-sheet; the European CentralBankseemslikelyto cutthe scale of itsas-setpurchasesnextyear; the Bankof Eng-land mighteven increase ratesforthe ﬁrsttime in more than a decade.Central banksare well aware ofthedangers, ofcourse; thatiswhyinterestratesare still so low, even though devel-oped economieshave been growingforseveral years. Butthe processofwith-drawingstimulusistricky. Abigsell-oﬀ inthe government-bond marketsin 1994started when the Fed tightened policyaftera period when rateswere kept lowduringthe savings-and-loan crisis.The high level ofassetpricesmeansthatanykind ofreturn to “normal” valua-tion levelswould constitute a crisis, onDeutsche’sdeﬁnition. Thatmightmeanthatcentral banksare forced to changecourse and loosen policyagain. But theprocesswould take a little time; centralbankswill notwantto appeartoo en-slaved to the markets.Manyinvestorswill wantto ride outthe volatility; thathasbeen a winningstrategyin the past. The problemswillemerge amongthose investorswho haveborrowed moneyto buyassets—in Amer-ica the volume ofsuch debtexceeds thelevel reached in 2008. The bigquestion iswhich isthe mostvulnerable assetclass.American mortgage-backed securitieswere the killersin 2008; itisbound to besomethingdiﬀerentthistime round.

The French marketwasbeingﬂoodedwith cheap light, he complained. Actionwasnecessary: a lawclosingall windows,shuttersand curtains. Onlythatwould of-ferprotection againstthe source ofthis “ru-inouscompetition”, the sun.Three similarpleasare facingthe ad-ministration ofPresidentDonald Trump.Butthese are notparodies. On September22nd the United StatesInternational TradeCommission paved the wayforimportre-strictionson solarpanels, rulingthat im-portshad injured American cell manufac-turers.

Thisclusterofcasesrepresentsaround$15bn ofannual imports, lessthan 0.6% ofthe total. Buttheyare chunkyrelative tootherrequests, and unusuallytimed. “Usu-allythese trade casescome in waves, dri-ven bya recession ora strongdollar”, saysDouglasIrwin, an economichistorian atDartmouth College. Notthistime.Everyprotectionistisunhappyin hisown way. Boeing, an American aeroplane-maker, claimsthatBombardierused gov-ernmentsubsidiesto sell itsnewC-seriesairlinersbelowcost. Fred CromerofBom-bardierAerospace accusesBoeingofa“commercial attack” to reduce competi-tion. Boeinghasnotmade planesofthesame size asthe C-Seriessince 2006, andall planemakerssell aircraftata loss in theearlyyearsofnewmodels. Senioradvisersto Boeingconcede thattheywere too lateto spotthe competitive threatfrom subsi-diesto Airbus, a European rival. They wantto hitBombardierbefore itgrowsup.The case ofsolarpanelswasbrought bySuniva and SolarWorld Americas. Theyblame ﬁnancial troubleson imported so-larcells, which surged by500% between2012 and 2016. Cheap Chinese supplyhasnotbeen contained bynarroweranti-dumpingduties, theyclaim, asproducershave setup operationsin third countries. Whirlpool, an American domestic-ap-pliance company, isseekingbroad protec-tion foritswashingmachines, also com-plainingthatitscompetitorshavebypassed tariﬀs. Risingimportsfrom Thai-land and Vietnam more than oﬀsetthedrop in importsfrom China between 2015and 2016. Itsopponentsin the case accuse itofﬁddlingthe deﬁnition ofwashing mach-ine to showa surge, and have suggestedthe companyhaslostmarketshare be-cause ofitsfadingbrand recognition. Even ifthe casesﬁzzle, some damagewould alreadyhave been done. The uncer-taintythe trade actionsintroduce often hasachillingeﬀecton trade and investment.ButMrTrump seemsto be itchingto im-pose tariﬀs, and some importrestrictionsseem almostcertain. Thiswould sourin-ternational relations. The British govern-menthasthreatened retaliation overthethreatto the jobsofBombardierworkers inNorthern Ireland. The actionswill mostprobablybe challenged atthe World TradeOrganisation. Theyalso riskcomplicatingthe continuingrenegotiation ofthe NorthAmerican Free-Trade Agreement(NAFTA),adeal between America, Mexico and Can-ada. The original deal containsprotectionsforMexican and Canadian exportersagainstthissortoftrade action.MrBastiat’ssatirical plea to the Frenchparliamentexplicitlypitted producersagainstconsumers. Similarly, pricier solarpanels, washingmachinesorplane ticketswill lighten consumers’ wallets. Americanbusinessesthatuse solarpanelswould behurtbyimportrestrictions, too. Tom Wer-ner, chiefexecutive ofSunPower, an Amer-ican solar-energycompany, and an oppo-nentofthe action taken bySuniva andSolarWorld, reportsthatthisisthe hot top-icamonghisemployees.

Adwindlingstockofdiscoverable insightswould mean corre-spondinglylessscope forprogressin the future—a dismal pros-pect. And some signssuggestthatthe well ofourimagination hasrun dry. Though evermore researchersare diggingforinsights, ac-cordingto newresearch, the ﬂowofnewideasisﬂagging.

Meagre rises, in turn, lead some to conclude that there aresimplynotmanybreakthroughsleftto be uncovered, ofthe sortthatlifted livingstandardsduringthe Industrial Revolution. That,forinstance, isthe viewofRobertGordon, an economist atNorth-western University, whose bleakbook, “The Rise and Fall ofAmerican Growth”, reckonsthatthe era ofeconomicrevolutionisbehind us.Isit? ArecentpaperbyNicholasBloom, CharlesJones and Mi-chael Webb ofStanford University, and John Van Reenen of theMassachusettsInstitute ofTechnology, providesrelevant evi-dence. Though strikingan agnosticposition asto whether hu-manityhasused up all itseureka moments, theynonethelessconclude thatnewideasare gettingmore expensive to ﬁnd. Theauthorsconsiderfourdiﬀerentcase studies, within which theycompare research “inputs” (such asthe moneyspenton research-ersand lab equipment) and outputs. The numberoftransistorsthatcan be squeezed onto a microchip hasdoubled with reassur-ingregularityforhalfa century, everytwo yearsorso—a phenom-enon known asMoore’sLaw(afterGordon Moore, a founder ofIntel). Yetthissuccesshasbeen achieved bypouringmore andmore resourcesinto the eﬀortovertime.

Investmentsin education and train-ing, to expand the share ofworkersthatcan use newideas, orinthe qualityofmanagement, to improve howeﬀectivelyideas areapplied within ﬁrms, would do wondersforgrowth, even iftheworld’sscientistsare idlyscratchingtheirheads. Analysingthe supplyside ofthe innovation equation in isola-tion can also be misleading. The demand fornewideas, and, cor-respondingly, the incentive to tackle diﬃcultquestions, also mat-ters. In hisanalysisofthe Industrial Revolution, Robert Allen, aneconomichistorian then atOxford, soughtto explain why itstart-ed in Britain ratherthan anywhere else. Supply-side factors, suchasimproved literacyand strongerpropertyrights, certainlyplayed a part. Butitwasthe demand forlabour-savinginnova-tion, prompted byBritain’srelativelyhigh wagesatthe time,which gave tinkerersa strongincentive to develop and hone thesteam engine and itsapplications. Putdiﬀerently, researchersare often like the drunken mansearchingforhiskeysunderthe streetlight, because that iswherethe lightis. Until some pressure isapplied to encourage him tolookelsewhere, the search will often prove fruitless. It iseasytosee whyﬁrmsmighttake a lackadaisical approach to some re-search questions.

Forthose thatlive farfrom human dwellings, twigs andleavespredominate. Forthose thatlive incities, the listofmaterialsismore eclectic.Often itincludesplasticbags, paper,aluminium foil, electrical cablesandeven cigarette butts. Mostofthese havebeen assumed to be the resultofbirdssimplymakingdo with whatthe urbanworld providesthem, buta studyjustpublished in Avian BiologybyMonserratSuárez-Rodríguezand Constantino Ma-cíasGarciaofthe National AutonomousUniversityofMexico hasdemonstratedthatthe cigarette buttsare beingwoveninto nestsnotbyaccidentbutbydesign.Thatidea hasbeen around, thoughneverproved, since 2012. ThiswaswhenDrSuárez-Rodríguezshowed thatnestswhich had buttswoven into them werelesslikelyto contain bloodsucking para-sitesthan were neststhatdid not. Whatshe wasunable to showwaswhetherthenest-builderswere collectingdiscardedcigarettesdeliberatelyfortheirparasite-repellingproperties, orwhetherthatparasite protection wasan accidentalconsequence ofbuttsbeinga reasonablyabundantbuildingmaterial.To discoverthe truth, DrSuárez-Rodrí-guezand DrMacíasGarcia setup anexperimentinvolvinghouse ﬁnchesthatwere nestingon theircampus. Theystudied 32 nestingpairsofthese birds,waitingfortheireggsto hatch. As soon asthathappened—a time when, the re-searchersknew, meddlingwith the nestswould be unlikelyto cause the ﬁnches toabandon them—theycollected the liningsofthe nestsand replaced them with cupsoffeltthatwere wreathed with bits ofplantmaterial commonlyused bythebirds. Takingthe old liningsremovedboth anyparasitictickspresent(sincethese live in the linings) and anybuttmaterial, which also tendsto getwoveninto the material. Once the newliningswere in place, the researchersaddedparasitesto some ofthem. Ten ofthenestseach had 70 live ticksadded, tenhad 70 dead ticksadded and 12 had noticksadded. Theythen waited forthechicksto ﬂedge and, once thathad hap-pened, collected the liningsofthe nestsforfurtheranalysis.Speciﬁcally, theylooked atthe num-berofbuttswhich the ﬁncheshadbroughtto the nestsafterthe newliningshad been ﬁtted. Neststhathad had deadticksorno ticksadded alongwith thenewliningscontained no butts. In con-trast, those neststhathad had live ticksadded to them contained, on average,one-and-a-quarterbuttseach. Basedupon these ﬁndings, DrSuárez-Rodríguezand DrMacíasGarcia argue thattheirﬁnchesare indeed collectingcigarettebuttsdeliberately, to keep ticksat bayandimprove the survival oftheiryoung. Some birds use discarded cigarettes to fumigate theirnestsSmoking kills—bugs“OURsires’ age wasworse than ourgrandsires’. We, theirsons, aremore worthlessthan they; so in ourturnwe shall give the world a progenyyet morecorrupt.” Thatwasthe wayofthe world ac-cordingto Horace, a Roman poet, writingin about20BC. He hasno shortage ofcontemporarysuccessors. Doomsayersofthe pasttwocenturieshave blamed, amongotherthings, novels, the radio, jazz, rock ‘n roll,television, horrorﬁlms, Dungeons& Dra-gons, video games, the internet, smart-phonesand social media forthe sad de-cline ofthe young. John Protzko, apsychologistatthe UniversityofCalifor-nia, Santa Barbara, though, wonderedwhetherthingsmightnotbe quite sogloomyastheyseemed. To tryto bringsome rigourto the question, he wenthunt-ingforexamplesofa cognitive experimentcalled the marshmallowtest. Thistest, ﬁrstperformed atStanford Universityin the1960s, measureshowgood youngchildrenare atself-control—speciﬁcally, whether ornottheycan defera small butimmediatereward, such asa marshmallow, in favourofa biggerone later. Itwasone ofthe ﬁrstexamplesofa standardised psychologicaltest, so itgave him plentyofhistorical datato workwith. The set-up issimple.

DrProtzko examined data from 30 stud-iesspanningthe past50 years(though theoriginal Stanford studywasnotone ofthem). Atthe same time, he polled 260 ex-pertsin child cognitive development, invit-ingthem to predictwhathe mightﬁnd. Justoverhalfthoughtthatchildren wouldhave become worse atdelayinggratiﬁca-tion—perhapsthinkingabouta plethora ofrecentofstudiesinto the supposedly dele-teriouseﬀectsofmodern technology. An-otherthird predicted no change. Only16% ofthe expertsmade the cor-rectprediction. Thisis, thatchildren havebecome steadilyand signiﬁcantlybetter atthe testoverthe pasthalfcentury. In 1967,the average waitingtime before succumb-ingto temptation wasaround three min-utes. By2017, thathad risen to eightmin-utes—an increase ofabouta minute adecade. And thatincrease seemsto be hap-peningatall levelsofability. The most im-pulsive children are improvingatthe samerate asthe mostprudent. The rate ofincrease caughtDrProtzko’seye aswell. Thatrate, a ﬁfth ofa standarddeviation everydecade, isaboutthe sameimprovementashasbeen seen in IQtestsoverthe past80 years. (Standard deviationisa measure ofvariation abouta mean val-ue. Abouttwo-thirdsofa normal distribu-tion lieswithin one standard deviation ofthe mean.) The cause ofthisincrease in IQ,which isdubbed the Flynn eﬀectafter thepsychologistwho broughtitto the world’sattention, remainsmysterious—asdoeswhetherDrProtzko’sresultsare related toit. IQisassociated with the abilityto delaygratiﬁcation, butthe correlation is farfromperfect.Whatisclear, though, isthatHorace andhissuccessorsare notonlywrong(theymustbe, orcivilisation would have col-lapsed into the mud longago), butthat,overrecentyears, youth hasactually beenimproving, atleastin some respects. “Talk-ingdown the young,” DrProtzko observes,“seemsto be a sortofhuman cognitive tic.”He isnowinterested in workingoutwhy.7IN2009 AbleGamers, an American chari-tyhopingto improve the lotofdisabledvideo-game players, sentsome representa-tivesto a game-developmentconference inSan Francisco.

The mostcommon type ofcolourblindness, forexample, isdeuteranopia.Thisaﬀectsabout5% ofmen, and makesithard forthem to distinguish between redand green. Those two coloursare oftenused in video gamesto deﬁne opposingteamsorto indicate correctand incorrectchoices. RockstarGames, the NewYork-based authorsofthe “Grand TheftAuto”seriesofvideo games, getaround that pro-blem byusingdiﬀerentshapesaswell asdiﬀerentcoloursin the game’sbuilt-inmap.

The up-perestimatesare more than a thousand.The areassweptawayhad notbeen evacu-ated partlybecause no one knewhowmuch rain had actuallyfallen beforehand,lamentsModeste Kacou, a rainfall expert atFélixHouphouët-BoignyUniversityin Ab-idjan, in nearbyIvoryCoast. Rain gaugesare sparse in Sierra Leone. Satellites detectrainfall in the tropics, butestimates forsmall areasare often inaccurate. Worse,these numbersare calculated hoursafterthe fact. Manycountriestherefore usecloud-scanningground radarto measureprecipitation asitishappening, but SierraLeone hasno such radar.Nordo manyotherpoorcountries. Ivo-ryCoasthasdouble the GDPperperson ofSierra Leone, butlike mostofwestAfrica, italso lacksprecipitation radar. Indeed,maintenance costsmean thatthe numberofweatherstationsaround the entireworld isshrinking, makingithardertoforecastﬂash ﬂoodsand landslideseven insome rich countries. Itwould be useful,therefore, ifsome otherwayofmeasuringrainfall—preferablya cheap one thatem-ploysexisting, widespread equipment—could be devised. Fortunately, there is justsuch a method, and itinvolvesmobile-phone networks.The basicinsightisstraightforwardenough: rain weakenselectromagneticsig-nals. Manymobile-phone towers, espe-ciallyin remote areas, use microwaves tocommunicate with othertowerson thenetwork. Adip in the strength ofthose mi-crowavescould therefore reveal the pres-ence ofrain. The technique isnotas accu-rate asrooftop rain gauges. But, asDr Kacoupointsout, transmission towersare farmore numerous, theyreporttheirdataautomaticallyand theycostmeteorolo-gistsnothing. He runsthe IvoryCoast oper-ationsofRain Cell Africa, an eﬀort paid forbythe World Bank, the UNFoundation, acharity, and the Institute forDevelopmentResearch, which isbased in France, to maprainfall in partsofAfrica usingdata do-nated byOrange, a bigtelecomsﬁrm, andTelecel Faso ofBurkina Faso, a small one.Had the system been runningin Sierra Le-one, he reckonsevacuationscould havebeen carried outin time.Rich countriesare interested, too. Api-lotprojectin the Netherlandsa fewyearsago produced promisingresults, butit hasnotyetbeen followed up. Thismonth oﬃ-cialsin Gothenburg, Sweden, began tostudyrainfall mapsderived from data col-lected everyten secondsfrom 418 mobile-phone towersowned bya ﬁrm calledHi3G. The hope isthiswill provide moreaccurate estimatesofrainwaterabout toslosh into the municipal waterworks, help-ingmanagersto limitﬂoodingand sewageoverﬂows. Until now, the cityhasrelied on13 rain gauges, backed up byradarsweepsofthe skythatare neithersuﬃciently fre-quentnorsuﬃcientlyprecise, saysJafetAndersson, a hydrologistbehind thescheme atthe Swedish Meteorological andHydrological Institute. Satellite data onrain in northern latitudesare so poor theagencydoesnotbotherusingthem atall.Though itisuseful to knowhowmuchrain isfallingrightnow, forecasting isevenbetter. Telecom data promise to make thiseasieraswell. Some newernetworksaresuﬃcientlysensitive thattheycan detecthumidityand fog, both ofwhich are pre-dictorsofimminentrain. Newergenera-tionsofmobile-phone mastsuse shorterwavelengthsin theirtransmissions, be-cause these can carrymore data. Ser-endipitously, thatalso permitstinieramountsofwaterto be detected, formois-ture weakensshortwavelengthsmorethan longones. Usingdata from about5,000 towersoperated bythree telecomﬁrmsin Israel, PinhasAlpertofTel AvivUniversitycreatesmoisture mapsthat, hesays, are farmore precise than those drawnwith data from the Israel MeteorologicalService’shumiditygauges, ofwhich thereare fewerthan 70.The rightwavelengthMoreover, because transmission towersare so common, predictingwhere rain-cloudsare beingpushed bywindsiseasyand accurate, notesDrAndersson. Severalgovernmentsin Africa and South-EastAsiahave asked histeam to setup rainfall-mea-surementnetworksforthem. No dealshave yetbeen signed, though, forthere isastumblingblock: money.Forthe time being, telecomscompaniesare happyto letforecastersuse their datafree ofcharge. Asthe value ofsuch data be-comesclearer, saysFrédéricCazenave ofthe Institute forDevelopmentResearch,thatislikelyto change. ConsiderClima-Cell, a ﬁrm based in Boston, Massachu-setts. In April ClimaCell began selling fore-castsbased on phone-towerdata whichare so precise, itclaims, thatitscustomerswill be able to tell “ifa plane, crane orgame” will getsoaked.The ﬁrm’sclientsinclude three airlines,several sportsleagues, a construction com-pany, a drone operatorand a hedge fund(which usesweatherforecaststo maketrades).

In herpowerful accountofthe faminein SovietUkraine in the early1930sAnneApplebaum, a Pulitzerprize-winningwrit-er(and a formerjournalistatThe Econo-mist), tellsan even more sinisterstory. Farfrom an unintended resultofill-conceivedpolicies, she argues, the roughly4m deathsfrom hungerin 1932 and 1933 were partofadeliberate campaign byJosefStalin andthe Bolshevikleadership to crush Ukrai-nian national aspirations, literallystarvingactual orpotential bearersofthose aspira-tionsinto submission to the Sovietorder.Asherbook’ssubtitle says, Stalin was wag-ing“waron Ukraine”, the SovietUnion’sstrategicallyand economicallymostvalu-able republicafterRussia. War, asCarl vonClausewitzfamouslyputit, isthe continua-tion ofpoliticsbyothermeans. The politicsin thiscase wasthe Sovietisation of Uk-raine; the meanswasstarvation. Food sup-plywasnotmismanaged byUtopiandreamers. Itwasweaponised. AsMsApplebaum notes, thisisnot anewargument. Émigré survivorsofthefamine said asmuch in the 1950s. Theywere largelydismissed, however, asright-wingconspiracy-mongersdriven byanti-communism and Ukrainian nationalisthatred ofRussia. Thirtyyearslater, though,adocumentaryﬁlm, “HarvestofDespair”(produced bymembersofCanada’sUkrai-nian community) and RobertConquest’sbook“HarvestofSorrow” began to changeminds. Forthe ﬁrsttime, the word Holodo-mor(Ukrainian for“killingbyhunger”) be-gan to reach large audiences. With the disintegration ofthe SovietUnion in 1991, scholarsgained accessto anenormoustrove ofhistorical documents,notleastin newlyindependentUkraine.No evidentiarysmokinggun hasyetemerged demonstratingordersfrom theKremlin to impose famine. Whathascometo light, and whatMsApplebaum synthe-sisesin lucid and vigorousprose, is a dev-astatingcircumstantial case. “Red Famine”presentsa Bolshevikgovernmentso hell-benton extractingwealth and controllinglabourthatitwaswillingto conﬁscate thelastremaininggrain from hungrypeasants(mostlybutnotexclusivelyin Ukraine) andthen blockthem from ﬂeeingfamine-af-ﬂicted areasto search forfood. The book’smostpowerful passagesde-scribe the moral degradation thatresultedfrom sustained hunger, asfamilysolidarityand village traditionsofhospitality with-ered in the face ofthe overwhelmingde-sire to eat. Undera state ofsiege by Sovietauthorities, hunger-crazed peasantstookto consuming, grass, animal hides, manureand occasionallyeach other. People be-came indiﬀerentto the sightofcorpses ly-ingin streets, and eventuallyto their owndemise. Stalin wasnotonlyaware oftheensuingmassdeath (amountingto roughly13% ofUkraine’spopulation). He activelysoughtto suppressknowledge ofit(includ-ingbanningthe publication ofcensusdata), so asnotto distractfrom the cam-paign to collectivise Sovietagriculture andextend the CommunistParty’sreach intothe countryside—a campaign MsApple-baum callsa “revolution...more profoundand more shockingthan the original Bol-shevikrevolution itself”. Known forhersharplycritical previousbooksaboutStalin’sgulagand the Sovieti-sation ofeastern Europe afterthe secondworld war, MsApplebaum isnotshyaboutsuggestingparallelsbetween Stalin’swarand VladimirPutin’scampaign in Ukrainetoday. “Eightyyearslater,” she writes, “itispossible to hearthe echo ofStalin’sfearofUkraine—orratherhisfearofunrestThe Ukrainian famineThe makingofamass murderRed Famine: Stalin’s War on Ukraine.ByAnne Applebaum.

Foralongwith itseﬀortsto rootout“bour-geois” nationalisms, the Kremlin relent-lesslypromoted a Sovietversion ofUkrai-nian identity, asitdid with mostotherethnicminorities. Eightdecadeson, thatlegacyhasdone even more to shape to-day’sUkraine than the Holodomor.Stalin’sassaulton the Ukrainian peas-antrymarked the third in a seriesof at-temptsto modernise the inherited agrari-an order, followingthe emancipation ofthe serfsin 1861and prime ministerPyotrStolypin’sattemptin 1912 to transform for-merserfsinto yeoman farmers. With sear-ingclarity, “Red Famine” demonstratesthehorriﬁcconsequencesofa campaign toeradicate “backwardness” when underta-ken bya regime in a state ofwarwith itsown people.7HANDScan reveal much aboutthe livesoftheirowners.

Then hewentto artschool. Histeachersatthe Kun-stakademie in Düsseldorf, where he beganstudyingin 1977, were Bernd and Hilla Be-cher, a couple whose austere photographsofindustrial buildings, from watertowersto blastfurnaces, were amongthe most cel-ebrated imagesin contemporaryart. Theyencouraged MrRuﬀto thinkmore deeplyaboutthe historyand genresofphotogra-phy, itstechnologiesand techniques, itslimitsand possibilities, and howitrelatesto otherartformslike paintingand sculp-ture. The simple ambition evolved into amore complicated one: to produce pictureswhich, whateverelse theywere about,were aboutphotographyitself. Anewretrospective ofMrRuﬀ’sworksince 1979, on displayatthe WhitechapelGalleryin London, addsup to an enthrall-ingand unnervingexploration ofthe me-dium. Since MrRuﬀwasa student, photog-raphyhasbeen transformed bydigitaltechnology, the internetand social media.He hasbeen alertto everyshiftand devel-opment. Hisworklaysbare howphoto-graphsare manipulated, distributed anddevoured in printand online, in the news,surveillance and pornography. He began, in the usual manner, by tak-ingphotographshimself. One highlight ofthe showisan earlyseriesofportraits ofhisfellowart-school studentsmade in the1980s. He positioned each subjectagainst aplain white background underidenticallighting, and asked them to lookinto hislarge-formatcamera with asneutral an ex-pression aspossible, takingthe rigour andprecision with which the Bechershad shotbuildingsand applyingitto the humanface. The results, which MrRuﬀprintedovera metre tall, resemble passportoridentity-card photos, upendingthe usualnotionsofthe portrait. In hishands a genretraditionallyused to illuminate personal-ityshowsconformityinstead.Then, in 1989, MrRuﬀobtained a cacheofold negativesfrom the European South-ern Observatoryin the Atacama Desert.Fascinated byastronomysince he wasachild, he began experimenting, croppingand enlargingthem to create grand skys-capesofspace dustand shiningconstella-tions. Hungopposite the portraitsin the ex-hibition, these representa turningpoint inhiscareer. From then on he spentless timebehind the camera and more time atthecomputer, buyingprintsin online auctionsand scouringthe internetforpictureswhich he would then tweakand rearrangeto create newworks.Often these take advantage ofthe waydigital imagesare made to achieve jar-ringlybeautiful eﬀects. In hisseries of“JPEGs”, he enlarged low-resolution pho-tographsofdisasters, ofthe kind that read-ersconsume in theironline newsfeeds ev-eryday. Ablurred image of9/11ortheaftermath ofan explosion, asyoumovecloser, becomesan abstractgrid ofpixels inﬁnelygraded tonesasthe image ofdestruc-tion itselfbeginsto disintegrate.More painterlystill are his“Nudes”.These are stillsfrom pornographicweb-sites—tonguesentwined, a naked manseen from behind—enlarged and blurreduntil theytake on a dreamysoftness. Theyare MrRuﬀ’scontribution to an ancientgenre, made in an age where the majorityofnude imagescome in the form ofonlineporn. In “Substrates” (pictured) he goesfur-ther, layeringeroticmanga cartoonsovereach otheruntil the ﬁguresdisappear, leav-ingjustwild swirlsofbrightcolour. MrRuﬀhasalso been an earlyadopterofnewtechnologiesforcreatinghisownphotographs. Duringthe ﬁrstGulfwar in1991, asfootage wasrelayed on live televi-sion, MrRuﬀgotnight-vision equipmentand turned iton suburban Düsseldorf, cap-turingquietstreets, parked carsand illumi-nated windows. The sinistergreen glow ofthese pictures, familiarthese daysfrom thecamerasofmilitarydrones, drawson thepowerofa visual style to create a sense ofthreat, even where there isnone.Amid the exhibition’stechnical wizard-ry, there isplentyofpure visual wonder.His“Photograms” are kaleidoscopesofshape and colourso gloriousthatthe com-plexityoftheircomposition quicklyfadesfrom the mind. The photogram wasa tech-nique favoured bysurrealistslike Man Ray,who made abstractcompositionsbysim-plyplacingobjectson light-sensitive paper.In MrRuﬀ’sversion, he used a computerprogram normallyused byarchitectstocreate entirelydigital paper, objects andlightsources. Forone photogram, he madeadigital tea-strainer.The wittiestmomentscome in “Nega-tives”. AmongMrRuﬀ’sarchive are 19th-centuryprintsfrom India and from the stu-diosofFrench artists. He hasinverted thecoloursofthe originalsto create what looklike old photographicnegatives. To see thepositive image, there isa simple trick: takeoutyourphone, reverse the coloursin thecamera’ssettings, and pointitatthe pic-ture. Asever, MrRuﬀislookingatphotog-raphythrough the latestlens.7PhotographyManipulation manHowThomas Ruﬀdisassembles andreassembles photographyManga-niﬁcenttaryelements—the step-by-step dispersalofthe refugees, the bureaucraticnightmareastheyriskdrowning“in riversand oceansofpaper”—buttranscendsreportage.

Richard’snewfriends—Rashid, Karon, Yussuf, Ithemba—carrya rich load ofmemoryand grief; theirliveshave been “cutoﬀ…asifwith aknife”. Yetthe sudden collapse ofthe Sovi-etblochastaughtRichard “the ephemeralnature” ofall frontiers. Through his eyes,and hisconviction thatthere are “no twohalves” to humankind, MsErpenbeckbindsthe upheavalsofpastand present,Europe and Africa. Lyrical and satirical byturns, she showsthatfearful isolation,emotional orpolitical, hurtswall-buildersand wall-jumpersalike.

Typical-lytheywould come atnightoratthe week-end, justashe wasunwinding. He wouldliftthe receiverto hearthe jauntystrains of“Arise, ourmightycountry!” in hisear, andknowthathe had to getdressed, now, andgetto the the base. Itwasa pain. But in thenervy1970sand 1980s, when an Americanattackon the SovietUnion mighthappenatanytime, an alertmightbe a practice, ormightbe the real thing. Eitherway, themotherland had to be defended. “The base” wasthe secretSerpukhov-15early-warningfacility, nearMoscow. Hehad worked there—since graduation, withtop honours, from the Radio-Technical Col-lege in Kiev—monitoringsurveillance byOko satellitesofthe missile launch areas ofthe United States. Itscore wasa room of200 computeroperatorsoverwhich, whenhe wason duty, he would preside from aglassed-in mezzanine oﬃce. On one wallofthe computerroom, an electronicworldmap litup the American launch areas: sixofthem, with a total of1,000 missilesaimed atthe USSR. Justabove hiseye level,awall’s-width screen glowed a dull red. Ifnothingappeared on it, all waswell. He worked regularcommand shiftsaswell asthe alerts, twice a month, just tokeep in training. Even hiswife Raisa didn’tknowwhathisworkwas. And, though thiswascombatduty, notmuch wasdoing: by10pm, aftersupperand a smoke, theywould awaitthe late-nightorbit, all quiet. September26th 1983 wasdiﬀerent. Athalfpastmidnight, the red screen ﬂashed“START”. Amissile wascoming. The sirenhowled. In the room below, people leaptfrom theirseats. Everyone looked up athim. He had frozen. The message seemedodd: one missile would notmean the all-outattacktheywere expecting. Buthowdid he know? Scared stiﬀ, he roared ateveryone to getbackto work. When hemanaged to pickup the phone, he reportedafaultin the system. Butthen itsaw a sec-ond missile. Athird, a fourth, a ﬁfth: “prob-abilityofattack, 100%”. In ten minutes,ground radarcould conﬁrm it. Butin 12minutesthe missiles, iftheywere coming,would hitRussia. High command needed12 minutesto organise theirresponse. Hishandsshaking, he called hissupe-riorsagain. Again he reported a malfunc-tion, nota strike. The oﬃceratthe otherend wasdrunk, butsomehowpassed iton.MrPetrovthen waited for15 unbearableminutes. And nothinghappened. Therewasindeed a faultin the system: the satel-lite had been fooled bythe sun’sraysre-ﬂectingoﬀcloudshigh overNorth Dakota,which had two launch areas. Everytime heremembered thatmomentwhen hiscallproved right, hislean face would break intoasmile ofsheerrelief. Hiscoolnesshad saved the world fromnuclearapocalypse. Orso otherpeoplesaid. He knewthat, atthe time, he had notbeen cool. Hischairhad feltred-hot asafryingpan, hislegslimp ascotton. Some ofhisdoubtswere logical: the newnessof thesystem, and the too-swiftpassage ofthemessage through the 30 layersofveriﬁca-tion he had setup himself. Otherdoubtswere vaguer: a funnygutfeeling, and asense thathe knewbetterthan a machine.Even so, hisdecision to declare a falsealarm wasa 50-50 guess, no better. Smallwonderthat, when itwasover, he felt aswrung-outasJesuson Golgotha. The factthathe wasbasicallya scientist,with a civilian training, also inﬂuencedhim. Much ashe had longed to be a ﬁghterpilotlike hisfather, a careersoldier wouldprobablyhave passed on the messagewithoutthinking. There were safeguardsagainstgoingto war, ornot, on the say-soofone man; otherauthoritieshad to be in-volved. Butin such febrile times, one roost-ercrowingwaslikelyto setoﬀall theothersin the village. Asforthose militarycockerels, theywere horriblyembarrassed bywhathehad done. So were all those renowned aca-demicianswho had spentbillionsdevis-ingthe surveillance system. Theydid notthankhim forshowingthem up, forit wasan old rule in Russia thatthe subordinatemustneverbe clevererthan the boss. In-stead, theyrapped him forfailingto ﬁll inthe operationslogthatnight. Come on, hethought. Afewmonthslaterhe leftthearmyanywayto take a job asa research en-gineerand to care forRaisa, who had can-cer. And so thingswentforseveral years.When she died, and moneygottight, hemostlylived on potatoesand tea brewedfrom herbshe picked in the park. Tea and potatoesHisstorystayed secretuntil 1998. When itcame out, he wasfeted in the West. Hetoured America, starred in a documentary,wascommended atthe UNand receivedthe Dresden peace prize. Sometimeshe en-joyed the fuss, butbitternessoverhis treat-mentathome would surface all the same.He wasoften tetchywith reporterswhomade theirwayto hissmall, grubbyﬂat on60th Anniversaryofthe USSRStreet, inFryazino north-eastofMoscow, and sat inhisbare kitchen with the star-charton thewall. He had done nothing, he would tellthem, excepthisdutyand hisjob. And allhe had to showforthatwasthe TVhiscol-leaguesatSerpukhov-15 had given himwhen he left, and the telephone thathadbeen installed, free, bythe armywhen hedrewhispension.
