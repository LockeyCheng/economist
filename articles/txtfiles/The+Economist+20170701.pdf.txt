BusinessThe EconomistJuly1st20179JULY4th oughtto bringAmeri-canstogether. Itisa day to cele-brate how13 youngcoloniesunited againstBritish rule to be-gin theirgreatexperimentinpopulargovernment. ButthisJuly4th Americansare riven bymutual incomprehension: be-tween Republicansand Democrats, yes, butalso between fac-toryworkersand universitystudents, countryfolkand city-dwellers. And then there isPresidentDonald Trump, not onlyasymptom ofAmerica’sdivisionsbuta cause ofthem, too.MrTrump won powerpartlybecause he spoke forvoterswho feel thatthe system isworkingagainstthem, asour spe-cial reportthisweeksetsout. He promised that, bydredgingWashington ofthe elitesand lobbyiststoo stupid orself-serv-ingto actforthe whole nation, he would ﬁxAmerica’spolitics.Hisapproach isnotworking. Five monthsinto hisﬁrst term,MrTrump presidesovera political culture thatiseven morepoisonousthan when he tookoﬃce. Hiscore votersare re-markablyloyal. Manybusinesspeople still believe that he willbringtaxcutsand deregulation. Buttheiroptimism stands onever-shakierground. The Trump presidencyhasbeen plaguedbypoorjudgmentand missed opportunities. The federal gov-ernmentisalreadyshowingthe strain. Soonerorlater, theharm will spread beyond the beltwayand into the economy.From sea to shining seaAmerica’slossoffaith in politicsdid notstartwith MrTrump.Fordecades, votershave complained aboutthe gridlock inWashington and the growinginﬂuence oflobbyists, oftenthose with the deepestpockets. FrancisFukuyama, a politicaltheorist, blamed the decayon the “vetocracy”, a tangle ofcom-petinginterestsand responsibilitiesthatcan blockalmost anyambitiousreform. When the world changesand the federalgovernmentcannotrise to the challenge, he argued, voters’disillusion onlygrows.MrTrump hasalso fuelled the mistrust. He hascorrectlyidentiﬁed areaswhere America needsreform, butbotched hisresponse—partlybecause ofhisown incontinentego. Take tax.No one doubtsthatAmerica’staxcode isa mess, stuﬀed full ofloopholesand complexity. ButMrTrump’sreform plansshoweverysign ofturninginto a cutforthe rich thatleaves the codeasbaﬄingasever. So, too, health care. Instead of reformingObamacare, Republicansare in knotsovera bill thatwouldleave millionsofMrTrump’sown voterssickerand poorer.Institutionsare vulnerable. The White House isright tocomplain aboutAmerica’soverlappingand competingagen-cies, which spun too much red tape underPresidentBarackObama. Yetitsattemptto reform this“administrative state” iswreckingthe machinerythe governmentneedsto function.MrTrump’shostilityhasalreadyundermined the courts, theintelligence services, the state departmentand America’senvi-ronmental watchdog. He wantsdeep budgetcutsand has fail-ed to ﬁll presidential appointments. Of562 keypositionsiden-tiﬁed bythe Washington Post, 390 remain withouta nominee. Asharmful aswhatMrTrump doesisthe wayhe does it. Inthe campaign he vowed to ﬁghtspecial interests. But hissol-ution—to employbusinesspeople too rich forlobbyists tobuy—isno solution atall. JustlookatMrTrump himself: de-spite hishalf-hearted attemptsto disentangle the presidencyand the familybusiness, nobodyknowswhere one endsandthe otherbegins. He promised to be a dealmaker, buthis im-pulse to belittle hisopponentsand the miasma ofscandal andleakssurroundingRussia’srole in the campaign have made thechancesofcross-partyco-operation even more remote. Thelackofrespectforexpertise, such asthe attackson the Congres-sional BudgetOﬃce overitsdismal scoringofhealth-care re-form, onlymakesWashington more partisan. Mostimportant,MrTrump’sdisregard forthe truth cutsinto whatremains ofthe basisforcross-partyagreement. Ifyoucannotagree on thefacts, all youhave leftisa benighted clash ofrival tribes.Til selﬁsh gain no longerstainOptimistssaythatAmerica, with itsimmense diversity,wealth and reservesofhuman ingenuityand resilience cantake all thisin itsstride. MrTrump ishardlyitsﬁrst bad presi-dent. He maybe around foronlyfouryears—ifthat. In a federalsystem, the statesand bigcitiescan be islandsofcompetenceamid the dysfunction. America’seconomyisseeminglyinrude health, with stockmarketsneartheirall-time highs. Thecountrydominatesglobal tech and ﬁnance, and itsoil and gasproducershave more cloutthan atanytime since the 1970s.Those are huge strengths. Buttheyonlymitigate the dam-age beingdone in Washington. Health-care reform aﬀects asixth ofthe economy. Suspicion and mistrustcorrode all theytouch. Ifthe ablestAmericansshun a careerin public service,the bureaucracywill bearthe scars. Besides, a bad presidentalso imposesopportunitycosts. The risingmonopolypowerofcompanieshasgone unchallenged. Schoolsand training fallshorteven asautomation and artiﬁcial intelligence are aboutto transform the nature ofwork. IfMrTrump servesa full eightyears—which, despite attacksfrom hiscritics, ispossible—theprice ofparalysisand incompetence could be huge.The dangersare alreadyclearin foreign policy. By pander-ingto the beliefthatWashington elitessell America short, MrTrump isdoingenduringharm to American leadership. TheTrans-PaciﬁcPartnership would have entrenched America’sconceptoffree marketsin Asia and shored up itsmilitary alli-ances. He walked awayfrom it. Hisrejection ofthe Paris cli-mate accord showed thathe seesthe world notasa forumwhere countriesworktogetherto solve problems, butas anarena where theycompete foradvantage. Hiserraticdecision-makingand hischumminesswith autocratslead hisallies towonderiftheycan depend on him in a crisis.July4th isa time to rememberthatAmerica hasrenewed it-selfin the past; thinkofTheodore Roosevelt’screation ofamodern, professional state, FDR’sNewDeal, and the Reaganrevolution. In principle itisnottoo late forMrTrump to em-brace bipartisanship and addressthe real issues. In practice, itiseverclearerthathe isincapable ofbringingabout such a re-naissance. Thatwill fall to hissuccessor. 7Adivided countryDonald Trump was elected to shake Washington outofits paralysis. He is adding to America’s problemsLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistJuly1st20171IRONYisnotdead in the Mid-dle East. In April Saudi Arabia,aland where women maynotdrive, orleave the country with-outthe written permission of amale “guardian”, orappearinpublicwithoutan all-envelop-ingcloak, waselected to theUN’scommittee on women’srights. Nowthatsame monarchy,where the governmentcensorseverythingfrom political dis-sentto risqué Rubenspaintings, and where a pro-democracybloggernamed RaifBadawi hasbeen sentenced to 1,000lashesand ten yearsin jail, istryingto shutdown the onlybig,feistybroadcasterin the Arab world, Al Jazeera. This isan ex-traordinary, extraterritorial assaulton free speech. ItisasifChina had ordered Britain to abolish the BBC. Al Jazeera isbased in Qatar, a tiny, wealthyGulfstate thatthe Saudis, Emiratis, Bahrainisand Egyptiansare subjecting toaheavy-handed blockade. Qatar’ssins, in Saudi eyes, are man-ifold. Itisfriendlywith Iran (though so are Oman and Dubai,which are notsubjectto the same strictures). Itharbours doz-ensofpeople the Saudisdo notlike, includingsome with closelinksto groupsaﬃliated to al-Qaeda. And itownsAl Jazeera. Lastweeknewsleaked thatSaudi Arabia isdemanding theclosure ofAl Jazeera aspartofthe price forlifting the blockade.The Qatarishave onlya fewmore daysto complyorface un-speciﬁed furtheraction.Youcan see whythe Saudiswould like Al Jazeera to go dark.Unlike otherMiddle Eastern broadcasters, which in place ofnewstend to emita wearisome stream ofunexamined govern-mentannouncementsand fawningfootage ofprincesandpresidentsembracingeach other, Al Jazeera, which was setupin 1996, triesto tell viewerswhatisactuallygoingon. Duringthe Arab springof2011itoﬀered a platform to the region’sprot-esters, includingthe Muslim Brotherhood, which wenton toform a short-lived governmentin Egypt, and to challenge in-cumbentregimesin otherstatesaswell. Arab autocrats foundthisboth alarmingand infuriating. Some in the Westdislike Al Jazeera, too. When itbroadcastOsama bin Laden’stape-recorded messagesfrom hiscave inAfghanistan, manyconcluded thatitwasnotreporting a bignewsstoryso much aspromotingterrorism. In 2004 the newgovernmentin Iraq, still underthe thumb ofthe American-ledcoalition thathad ousted Saddam Hussein the previous year,closed Al Jazeera’sBaghdad oﬃce fora month; in 2016 Iraq’sgovernmentclosed itagain, fora year, forsupposedly stirringup sectarianism and violence byreportingon itunsparingly.Drawing a veil overitAll these banswere wrong. Al Jazeera isnota perfect newsor-ganisation, butitstrivesto oﬀera varietyofviewpoints: gov-ernmentand dissident, domesticand foreign. One ofits slo-gansis: “The opinion and the otheropinion”. Granted, ithas alarge blind spotin the shape ofQataritself, which never re-ceivesthe sortofcriticism the channel routinelyhands outtoothers. There isalso a distinction to be drawn between Al Ja-zeera’sEnglish-language service (started with the help ofmanystaﬀpoached from the BBC) and itsArabicversion,which ismore biased in supportofpolitical Islam, more toler-antofextremism and closerto beinga mouthpiece for the Qa-tari government. Saudi Arabia and the UAE wantto close bothofthem. Yeton anyfairaccounting, Al Jazeera performs a valu-able service byaddingto the supplyofnewsand views aboutthe Middle East. Itwould be absurd to argue thatthe Arabworld’sproblem wastoo much information ortoo free a ﬂowofideas. The opposite iscloserto the truth. Saudi Arabiashould stop tryingto extend itsharsh brand ofcensorship to itsneighbours; indeed, itshould stop bullyingthem entirely. 7Free speechHands oﬀAl JazeeraThe Arab world has one big freewheeling broadcaster.

Iftheywere worried,the British oﬃcialswho attended the handoverceremonytried notto showit. China, afterall, had promised that HongKong’swayoflife would remain unchanged foratleast 50yearsundera remarkable arrangementthatitcalled “onecountry, two systems”. Even the lastBritish governorof HongKong, ChrisPatten—an outspoken criticofChina’sCommunistParty—called thatrain-soaked day“a cause forcelebration”.

Butmanypeople in HongKongwill be lessthan de-lighted byhispresence. MrXi isno friend ofitsfreedoms.

Atthe time ofthe handover, this newspa-perexpressed the hope thatHongKongwould help “changeChina” politically. The opposite ishappening.Wishful thinking?In 1997 there were groundsforoptimism, despite the crushingofthe Tiananmen protests. In ﬁtsand starts, China was evolv-ingin a waythatcould make itmore amenable to democraticreform in HongKong. Itwaskeen to join the World Trade Orga-nisation, and thus, itseemed, to embrace free-market princi-ples. Itwasreasonable to expectthata private sector and amiddle classwould arise in China and begin to demand morefreedom. In villagesthe partywasexperimentingwith moredemocracy. Would these eﬀortsencourage similarones in ur-ban areas, too, Chinese liberalswondered? In 1998 a newlyap-pointed (and refreshinglyreformist) prime minister, ZhuRongji, suggested theymightindeed. “Ofcourse I am in favourofdemocraticelections,” he said. Twentyyearson, Chinese oﬃcialsno longerbother even totalkaboutpolitical reform. UnderMrXi, the partyhas beentighteningitsgrip. Ahuge newmiddle classhasemerged,armed with the internet. But, fearingthe potential power ofwell-informed and interconnected citizens, the partyis striv-ingto keep them in check—beeﬁngup the police and deploy-ingarmiesofcensorsto scrub the internetclean. Atthe time ofHongKong’shandover, China wasatleastprepared, occasionally, to release a dissidentortwo in ordertoheal the riftwith America caused bythe massacre in Beijing in1989. No longer.

Sure enough, everythingthe country hasdone oflate suggeststhe opposite—from sendingagents to ab-ductpeople from HongKong, to issuinga rulingto ensure thatlegislatorssympatheticto the idea ofHongKong’sindepen-dence cannottake up theirposts.

The city’syoungpeople feel alienated from the elite byanossiﬁed political system and deprived ofa voice bya lackoffull democracy. Thatmakesitunstable, aswasevident duringweeksofstudent-led protestsin 2014 and in riotingearlylastyear. The mainland haslotsofHongKongsin the making. Chi-na needsa chance to experimentwith a wayofdefusing un-restthatdoesnotmake people more sullen: democratic re-form. One country, two systemsmakesHongKongthe perfectopportunity. MrXi should seize it. 7IFONE goal hasanimated thereform ofﬁnance since the cri-sisof2007-08, ithasbeen a de-sire to spare taxpayersfrom hav-ingto pickup the bill for bankfailures. Regulatorshave intro-duced stressteststo see howbanksstand up to shocks; Amer-ica’slatestround oftestsconcluded thisweek(see page 61).Theyhave forced banksto fund themselveswith more equityand to issue layersofdebtthatare earmarked forlosses in theeventofsevere trouble. Theyhave even asked banksto drawup plansfortheirown dismembermentin the eventoffailure. The ﬁrstreal testsofthispost-crisismachinerywere alwaysgoingto happen in Europe, which hasbeen damaginglyslowto face up to the sorrystate ofitsbanks. One such trial occurredearlyin June, when the European Central Bank(ECB) declaredthatBanco Popular, a bigSpanish lender, wasfailing orlikely tofail. In thatinstance, the machinerypurred. AnewEuropeanagency, the Single Resolution Board (SRB), tookcharge. Popu-lar’sshareholdersand juniorbondholderslosttheirmoney;anotherSpanish bank, Santander, raised itsown cash to fundthe purchase ofPopular; taxpayerswatched from the side-lines; and regulatorshailed a textbookbankresolution. The latesttestwasmore reminiscentofHeath Robinson. OnJune 23rd the ECBhanded outthe same “failingorlikelyto fail”verdictto two midsized lendersin Italy, Veneto Banca andBanca Popolare di Vicenza. Butthistime the outcome was verydiﬀerent. The SRBdetermined thatthe pairdid notpose athreatto ﬁnancial stability, and handed them to the Italian au-thoritiesto deal with undernational insolvencyprocedures.Instead ofseniorbondholderstakinglosses, aswould other-wise have happened, taxpayershave again found themselveson the hook. Publicmoneywill subsidise the purchase ofthetwo banks’ good assetsbyIntesa Sanpaolo, a bigItalian rival.Asmuch as€17bn ($19bn) ofstate fundscould be atrisk, al-though the actual bill islikelyto be lower(see page 59).It’s the political economy, stupidWhatconclusionsshould be drawn from these divergent out-comes? Optimistssee the fruitsofreform in both episodes;pessimistsfulminate thatpromisesto protecttaxpayers arebroken afterthe Italian deal, and thathopesofmoving to-wardsa true bankingunion are dead. The realitylies some-where in the middle.Europe’spost-crisisreformshave yielded genuine progress.First, the ECB’ssupervisorypowersovereuro-zone banksarewelcome. National regulatorswere prone to lookthe otherwaywhen bankswobbled; the ECB, which tookon the powersin 2014, haswaited too longto ﬂexitsmusclesbutisa morecredible judge ofﬁnancial trouble. Second, juniorbondhold-erscan nowbe certain thattheywill be wiped outwhen banksgetinto deep trouble (somethingthatwasnotalwaysguaran-teed duringthe crisis). Newinstrumentssuch as“contingentEuropean banksSeniormomentEuropean banksCredit-default-swap spreadsBasis points20101214170100200300400Europe’s frameworkfordealing with troubled banks is working, buthas one big drawbackThe EconomistJuly1st2017 Leaders132convertible” bonds, which are explicitlydesigned to forcelosseson theirownersin bad times, are doingtheirjob. There isa third reason to be hopeful. Italyhaslong assumedan ostrich-like posture on the non-performingassetscloggingup itsbanks, estimated at€349bn (gross) bythe BankofItaly.One reason forthe delayhasbeen a politicallycharged quirkofItalian ﬁnance: the factthatretail investorsare bigownersofItalian bankdebt. Imposinglosseson creditorsisless attractivewhen the eﬀectisto wipe outthe savingsofordinary citizens.The liquidations, and an earlierrescue ofMonte dei Paschi diSiena, a biggerbank, have avoided thisoutcome. That infuri-atesmany, who equate wriggle-room in the ruleson resolu-tion with licence to ignore them. Buta cleanerbanking systemresults. Thisweeka measure ofdefaultriskin Europe’sbanksfell to itslowestlevel since atleast2010. And the problem ofre-tail-owned bondsisfadingastheymature.Butthe casesofPopular, Monte dei Paschi and the two mid-sized Italian bankshave also revealed thatthe bigshortcomingin Europe’sresolution frameworkisan unwillingnessto im-pose losseson seniorcreditors, who rankabove shareholdersand juniorbondholdersin banks’ capital structures. Sparingthem pain iswrongin principle. There isno reason why suchinvestorsshould be free from risk. And itwill exacerbate wor-riesin Germanyand elsewhere thata full bankingunion, com-plete with a European deposit-guarantee fund, isa way tospend taxpayers’ money, notprotectit. Yethandingoutlossesfrom a bankfailure isan inherentlypolitical judgment. Thatiswhyordinarydepositorsare pro-tected. The reluctance to hitseniorinvestorsreﬂects a genuinefearofsparkingwidercontagion, perhapseven panic. Finan-cial regulatorsoughtto acknowledge thisdilemma and bepragmaticin response. Theyshould make sure thatbanks is-sue equityand layersofexplicitlyat-riskdebtto institutionalinvestorsin large enough quantitiesto minimise the chancesofhavingto bail in anyone else. Do that, and taxpayers willbeneﬁteven more from the post-crisisoverhaul. 7MANUFACTURINGadvan-cesoften take time to catchon. Onlylaterdoestheirreal sig-niﬁcance become apparent.

Theysaythat3Dprintersare too slowand tooexpensive—itcan take two daysto create a complexobject. Un-like the techniquespioneered byKay, Oldsand Ohno, additivemanufacturingwill neverrevolutionise massproduction.Such scepticism lookslessand lesscredible. Some ofthe newmethodsof3Dprintingnowemergingshowthatitsshortcomingscan be overcome (see page 17). Adi-das, forone, hasstarted to use a remarkable form of itcalled“digital lightsynthesis” to produce the solesoftrainers, pullingthem fullyformed from a vatofliquid polymer.

In February 2011,when The Economistran a storycalled“Printme a Stradivarius”, the idea ofprint-ingobjectsstill seemed extraordinary.Now, itiswell established. Additive manu-facturing, asitisknown technically, isspeedingup prototypingdesignsand isalso beingused to make customised andcomplexitemsforactual sale. These rangefrom false teeth, via jewellery, to parts forcarsand aircraft. 3Dprintingisnotyetubiquitous. Generally, itremainstoo slowformassproduction, too expensive forsome applicationsand forothersproducesresultsnotup to the required standard. But,asAdidas’ssolesshow, these shortcom-ingsare beingdealtwith. Itisnotfoolish tobelieve that3Dprintingwill powerthe fac-toriesofthe future. Norneed the technol-ogybe restricted to makingthingsout ofthose industrial stalwarts, metal and plas-tic. Itisalso capable ofextendingmanufac-turing’sreach into mattersbiological.Adding itupThere are manywaysto printsomething inthree dimensions, butall have one thing incommon: instead ofcutting, drillingandmillingobjects, asa conventional factorydoes, to remove material and arrive at therequired shape, a 3Dprinterstartswithnothingand add stuﬀsto it. The adding isdone accordingto instructionsfrom a com-puterprogram thatcontainsa virtual repre-sentation ofthe objectto be made, storedasa seriesofthin slices. These slices are re-produced assuccessive layersofmaterialuntil the ﬁnal shape iscomplete. Typically, the layersare builtup byex-trudingﬁlamentsofmolten polymer, byinkjet-printingmaterial contained in car-tridgesorbymeltingsheetsofpowderwith a laser. Adidas’ssoles, however,emerge in a strikinglydiﬀerentway—onethatis, accordingto Joseph DeSimone, theresultofchemistsratherthan engineersthinkingabouthowto make thingsaddi-tively. DrDeSimone isthe bossofCarbon,the ﬁrm thatproducesthe printerwhichmakesthe soles. He isalso a professor ofchemistryatthe UniversityofNorth Caro-lina, Chapel Hill. Carbon’sprinterusesa processcalleddigital lightsynthesis, which DrDeSimonedescribesas“a software-controlled chemi-cal reaction to growparts”. Itstartswith apool ofliquid polymerheld in a shallowcontainerthathasa transparentbase. Anultravioletimage ofthe ﬁrstlayerof the ob-jectto be made isprojected through thebase. Thiscures(ie, solidiﬁes) a corre-spondingvolume ofthe polymer, repro-ducingthe image in perfectdetail. Thatnow-solid layerattachesitselfto the bot-tom ofa tool lowered into the pool fromabove. The container’sbase itselfisperme-able to oxygen, a substance thatinhibitscuring. Thisstopsthe layerofcured po-lymerstickingto the base aswell, and thuspermitsthe tool to liftthatlayerslightly.The processisthen repeated with a secondlayerbeingadded to the ﬁrstfrom below.And so on. Asthe desired shape iscomplet-ed, the tool liftsitoutofthe container. Itisthen baked in an oven to strengthen it.DrDeSimone saysthatdigital light syn-thesisovercomestwo common problemsof3Dprinting. First, itisup to 100 timesfast-erthan existingpolymer-based printers.Second, the bakingprocessknitsthe layerstogethermore eﬀectively, makingfor astrongerproductand also one thathassmooth surfaces, which reducesthe needforadditional processing. All this, he reckons, makesdigital lightsynthesiscompetitive with injectionmoulding, a mass-production processwhich hasbeen used in factoriesfornearly150 years.

Injection mouldingistherefore eﬃcientonlywhen makingthousandsofidentical things. The usual economiesofscale, however,barelyapplyto 3D printers. Theireasy-to-change software meanstheycan turn outone-oﬀitemswith the same equipmentand materialsneeded to make thousands.Thataltersthe nature ofmanufacturing.Forexample, instead ofhavingvastware-housespacked with spare parts, Caterpil-larand John Deere, two American produc-ersofconstruction and agriculturalequipment, are workingwith Carbon onmovingtheirwarehouses, in eﬀect, to theonline cloud, whence digital designscanbe downloaded to diﬀerentlocationsforpartsto be printed to order.

Thistakesplace in multiple stages: depositingthepowder, spreadingitand, ﬁnally, fusing it.Such printerscan produce extremely in-tricate shapes, butmayneed to run for sev-eral daysto make a single item. Forhigh-end componentsused in low-volume pro-ducts, such assupercars, aircraft, satellitesand medical equipment, thiscan, never-theless, be worth the wait. 3Dprinting,which isable to create voidsinside objectsfarmore easilythan subtractive manufac-turingcan manage, increasesthe range ofpossible designs. There are costsavings,too. Addition, which depositsmetal onlywhere itisneeded, generateslessscrapthan subtraction.

And theyare ﬁve timesmoredurable, which reducesservicingcosts.More such developmentsare coming.GKNAerospace, a British ﬁrm, recentlysigned a ﬁve-yearagreementwith OakRidge National Laboratory, in Tennessee,to ﬁnd newwaysto printlarge structuralaircraftpartsin titanium. The intention isto reduce waste material byasmuch as90% and to cutassemblytime in half. Existingmetal printerscan be as bigasacar, and some cost$1m ormore. What,though, mightcompaniesachieve iftheyhad smaller, cheapermetal printers? RicFulop thinkshe can make such machines.MrFulop isthe bossofDesktop Metal, aﬁrm he co-founded in 2015 with a group ofprofessorsfrom the MassachusettsInsti-tute ofTechnologyand nearly$100m incash from investorsthatinclude GE, Strata-sysand BMW. The ﬁrm’sﬁrstprintersarenowcomingto market. Instead ofzappinglayersofpowderwith a laseroran electron beam, DesktopMetal’smachinesuse a processcalledbound-metal deposition. Thisalso in-volvesa bitofcooking. First, the machineextrudesa mixture ofmetal powderandpolymersto build up a shape, much assome plasticprintersdo. When complete,the resultgoesinto an oven.

ItsStudio system, priced ataround $120,000, isdesigned forproto-typesand small production runs. Afull-scale system costsjustover$400,000. Byincorporatinga conventional metal prin-ter’smultiple production stagesinto a sin-gle “sweep” ofthe printhead, DesktopMetal’smachinesare fast. Accordingto MrFulop, theycan build and bake objects atthe rate of500 cubicinches(8,194cm3) anhour. Thatcompareswith about1-2 cubicincheswith a conventional laser-basedmetal printer, or5 cubicincheswith anelectron-beam machine. On top ofall this, because the materialsused byDesktop Metal’sprintersare al-readyemployed in otherindustrial pro-cessestheyare, accordingto MrFulop, 80%cheaperthan some specialist3D-printingpowders. And theyrequire lessﬁnishing toremove rough surfaces.

Domin began asa design serviceworkingin the aerospace industry, butaftertwo yearsitsbossesdecided itshould make itsown products. Thosetheypicked were high-performancehydraulicpumpsand powered servo-valves, both ofwhich control ﬂuids inmechanismsfound in machinesrangingfrom aircraftto processingplantin fac-tories.

So,unlessthose volumescan actuallybesold, and economiesofscale achieved,bankruptcylooms. Atleast, itdoes withconventional manufacturingmethods.Domin, however, acquired a 3Dmetalprinterfrom EOS, a German ﬁrm. Andthat, saysMarcusPont, the company’sgeneral manager, overturned the calcula-tions. Fora start, economiesofscalehardlymatterwith a 3Dprinter. Chang-ingdesignsrequiresmerelya tweak ofthe software, ratherthan the retooling ofafactory. Thismeans, atthe operatinglevel, the unitcostofmakingone thing ormanythingsisaboutthe same. Moreover, a 3Dprintercan createsophisticated designsthatrequire lessmaterial to make, which letsproducts belighter. Usually, removingmaterial from aproductto lighten itmakesitmore expen-sive. Cutting, drillingand machiningrequire extra workand thusincurextracost. Thatwould normallypush a suppli-erinto a marketthatvaluesweight-sav-ing(see table). Atone end ofthe scale,Formula 1motorracing, a kilogram savedmaybe the diﬀerence between winningand losinga race. In thisbusiness such akilogram isworth more than $120,000. Atthe otherend, savinga kilogram onequipmentwhich sitson a factoryﬂoor isworth onlya fewdollars.Butwith a 3Dprinterhardlyanyadditional workisneeded. Indeed, con-traryto accepted wisdom, the lighter apartgetsthe cheaperitbecomesto make,because ofthe materialssaved. So Do-min decided to enterthe marketfor fac-toryand general equipmentﬁrst, with acompetitivelypriced lightweightservo-valve. Thisvalve is, though, identical tothe one theywill oﬀerformobile hydrau-licsin tractors, diggersand trucks, andalso to the one theyhope will qualify foraerospace use.

Butwhatwasmissing inbioprinting, reckoned ErikGatenholm andHectorMartinez, two biotechnologyentre-preneurs, wassome form ofstandardised“bio-ink”. So, in January2016, theyfound-ed a ﬁrm called Cellinkto commercialisebioprintingmaterialsdeveloped attheChalmersUniversityofTechnology, inGothenburg, Sweden.

The com-panyhasgone on to develop tissue-specif-icbio-inksthatcontain growth factorsneeded to stimulate particulartypesofcells, includingstem cells. These are cellsthatcan proliferate to produce anyof thecell typesthatform a particulartissue. Ifthe stem cellsin question are obtainedfrom the patientinto whom the transplantwill laterbe inserted, thatwill reduce theriskthatthe transplantwill be rejected.In addition to makingbio-ink, Cellinkhasalso launched itsown range ofprint-ers. These are sold ata discountto universi-tiesin return forresearch feedback. Thatprovidesa good picture ofwhatisgoingon. In particular, saysMrGatenholm, ad-vancesare beingmade in printingtissuesfordrugtesting. One isto employa pa-tient’sown cancercellsto printmultipleversionsofhistumour. Each can then bechallenged with a diﬀerentdrug, ormix-ture ofdrugs, to help determine what treat-mentwill workbest. Foractual transplan-tation, MrGatenholm suggeststhatcartilage, followed byskin, are likely to bethe ﬁrsttissuesprinted forsuch use. Organsthatneed blood vesselswill follow. Bioprinting, then, lookssetto become anewmanufacturingindustry—albeitonelocated atmedical centresand operating insterile conditionsthatmore resemble alaboratorythan a production plant. Buteven the lessesotericformsof3Dprinting,those involvingplasticsand metals, willtransform whata factoryis. The 3Dprintshopsofthe future will still have someworkers. Butthose will mainlybe hard-ware and software engineers.

Candi-dateswith the fewestﬁrst-preference votesare eliminated, with theirvotesgoing tothe nextcandidate named on the ballot,until one candidate attainsa majority. Thehope wasthatpeople would vote foraclansman with theirﬁrstpreference, butwould base theirothertwo choiceson lessparochial qualities. In practice, wantokssimplytrade preferential votes. Candi-datesare expected to hosthuge partieswith food and entertainment. “Everybodyexpectsyouto cookforthem,” complainsRawali Bokuik, who isrunningfora seat inPortMoresby.With votingdriven byethnicityandpork-barrel politics, national policy—in-deed, policyofanykind—playsvirtuallyno role.

Hownaive. DrMahathirmayhave stepped down in 2003 after22 yearsin oﬃce,buthe hashardlybeen retiringin retirement. Hisconstant snipinghelped topple hisimmediate successor, Abdullah Badawi, wholasted until 2009.Nowthe old warhorse ispickinga ﬁghtwith Najib Razak, theprime ministersince then and nowleaderofDrMahathir’sfor-merparty, the United MalaysNational Organisation (UMNO),which hasrun Malaysia forthe past60 years. DrMahathirhasregistered a newpolitical partyand persuaded Pakatan Harapan,the fractiouscoalition thatformsMalaysia’smain opposition, toadmititasa member. NowPakatan isdebatingwhetherto makeDrMahathirthe chairman oftheircoalition—and, perhaps, theircandidate forprime ministeratelectionswhich mustbe heldwithin 13 months. Havinglongsaid thathe would notbe return-ingto parliament, DrMahathirhaslatelybeen hintingthat hewould consideranotherstintin the top job.Itisdiﬃcultto imagine a more unlikelyturn ofevents. Theoriginal incarnation ofthe coalition DrMahathirmight soon berunningwasformed in the late 1990sto oppose hisown intermi-nable rule. Itsfounder, AnwarIbrahim, wasDrMahathir’sdepu-tyuntil the lattersacked him duringa powerstruggle; he waslaterjailed on sham chargesofcorruption and sodomy. The currentgovernment’smethodsare copied directlyfrom DrMahathir’splaybook. Since 2015 MrAnwarhasbeen backin prison follow-inga second sodomyconviction, thisone justasdubious astheﬁrst. The reversal ofthe authoritarian turn Malaysia took underDrMahathirisone ofPakatan’smain objectives.Whatmakesall thiseven tougherto stomach isthatDr Ma-hathir’sconversion to the opposition’scause looksdisturbinglyincomplete. Though he ishobnobbingwith formerenemies, theold codgerstill ﬁndsitdiﬃcultto apologise forthe excessesofhistenure. Manyofhisviewsremain wacky: in Mayhe told the Fi-nancial Timesthathe still thinksthe American orIsraeli govern-mentsmighthave arranged the attacksofSeptember11th 2001.Can Malaysia’sopposition reallyﬁnd no more palatable leader?These are desperate times, retortDrMahathir’ssupporters.Since 2015 newsaboutthe lootingof1MDB, a government-ownedinvestmentﬁrm from which atleast$4.5bn hasdisappeared, hasdragged Malaysia’sreputation through the muck. American gov-ernmentinvestigatorssaythat1MDB’smoneywasspenton jew-ellery, mansions, preciousartworksand a yacht, and that nearly$700m ofitwentto the prime minister. MrNajib sayshe has notreceived anymoneyfrom 1MDB, and that$681m deposited intohispersonal accountswasa giftfrom a Saudi royal (now re-turned). He haskepthisjob, butonlyafterreplacingthe deputyprime ministerand the attorney-general. One mightexpectthisscandal to propel Pakatan into power atthe comingelection, butinstead the opposition lookslikely tolose ground, perhapseven handingbackto UMNOand itsalliesthe two-thirdsmajorityrequired to amend the constitution. Thisbizarre reversal hasmuch to do with Malaysia’sregrettable racialpolitics: the Malay-Muslim majoritylargelyfavoursthe govern-mentand the bigethnic-Chinese and -Indian minoritiestend tovote againstit. MrNajib hasbaited an Islamistpartyinto renew-ingcallsformore ﬂoggingformoral lapses, forcingthem to leavePakatan. The splitin the opposition will lead to lotsof three-can-didate races, in which UMNOwill romp home.Putin thiscontext, DrMahathir’sreappearance isa godsend. Itstandsto transform Pakatan’schancesbygrantingaccessto abroad swathe ofrural constituenciesthattheyhad previouslythoughtunwinnable. ManyMalayshave fond memoriesoftheboomingeconomyofDrMahathir’sera (theyoverlookitscronycapitalism and hisintolerance fordissent); in theireyes, he putMalaysia on the map. Ascoalition chairman, DrMahathir mightalso bringsome orderto Pakatan’snoisycouncil meetings. Hisbackingcould be invaluable aftera narrowvictoryorin a hungparliament, when UMNO’screaturesin the bureaucracymight beexpected to putup a ﬁght.All these beneﬁtscould probablybe obtained without oﬀer-ingto make DrMahathirthe prime minister. Buthe maybe theonlyfrontman upon whom mostofthe coalition can agree. Thatrole had previouslyfallen to MrAnwar, butithasbecome cleartoall buta fewholdoutsthathe cannotcontinue to manage thequarrelsome coalition from hiscell. Votersare notsure whetherto believe Pakatan when itsaysthat, should itwin, it will ﬁndsome wayto catapultMrAnwaroutofhischainsand into thecountry’stop job. Norare theymuch inspired bythe notion ofac-ceptinga seat-warmerto run the countrywhile thistrickymanoeuvre takesplace.Itcould be worseThisisa depressingmess, even byMalaysia’sdismal standards.The opposition bearsno blame forthe dirtytrickswhich, overseveral shameful decades, the governmenthasused to hobbleMrAnwarand manyothers. Butbyfailingto nurture—oreven toagree upon—the nextgeneration ofleaders, theyhave playedstraightinto UMNO’shands.Itispossible thatthe thoughtofhoistingDrMahathir into thetop job will atlastforce the coalition to thrusta younger leadertothe fore (some suspectthatthisisthe outcome thatDr Mahathir, ashrewd strategist, hasalwayshad in mind). Butitisalso possiblethat, facingonlyuncomfortable options, theywill end up makingno decision atall. Some in Pakatan seem happyto barrel into thenextelection withouttellingvoterswho will lead Malaysiashould theywin. Thatmightseem like pragmatism, butit isreallyjustdefeatism. 7Doctoron callThe return ofa formerprime ministershows the sorrystate ofMalaysian politicsBanyan26The EconomistJuly1st20171For daily analysis and debate on China, visitEconomist.com/chinaCHENFENGwasin ﬁne spiritsashis Pa-risian guests, midwaythrough a ban-quetoflobsterand candied duck, toastedhissuccess.

There isa betterexplanation, namelythatthe action ispartofa broadercam-paign overthe pastsixmonthsto clean upthe ﬁnancial system: a “regulatorystorm”,asmanyhave described it. Oﬃcialshaveworked to close loopholes, to stamp out in-sidertradingand to cutrecklessborrowing.Theyhave targeted predatoryinvestors,describingthem as“ﬁnancial crocodiles”.

Itishard for inves-torsto be certain. Butthe Chinese govern-menthasmade itschoice. 7Liu Xiaobo’s “crime” was to call for democracy and urge others to support him. In 2009that earned him an 11-year jail sentence for “inciting subversion of statepower”—among the toughest penalties meted out for such an oﬀence since it wasestablished more than a decade previously. On June 26th it was revealed that Mr Liu willnever complete his term: he is on “medical parole” undergoing treatment in hospital forterminal liver cancer. Police have rarely allowed his wife to leave her home since he wasawarded the Nobel peace prize, in absentia, in 2010. But they have reportedly let hervisit his sick bed. The government apparently wants to avoid the international outcrythat a Nobel laureate dying behind bars, cut oﬀ from his family, would provoke. Mr Liu,however, is still not free. The authorities say he is subject to supervision by prisonoﬃcials. Protesters in relatively free Hong Kong have rallied this week to demand MrLiu’s release (above, a demonstrator there holds his picture). But on the mainland hisname is largely blocked online, as are references to “Charter 08”, his call for reform. Foratime, internet censors even tried to stop use of the phrase “empty chair”: the objectthat represented his absence at the Nobel ceremony in Oslo.Adissident’s hardest struggleONTHE the eveningofJune 17th nearly10,000 youngpeople packed a ﬂying-saucer-shaped theatre bythe Huangpuriv-erthatﬂowsthrough Shanghai.

Hisuncle, Nathan “Bodie”Barksdale, wasa bigshotin the more hier-archical Baltimore gangland he recalls.Avon Barksdale, a ﬁctional villain in “TheWire”, a TVcrime drama setin Baltimore,waspartlyinspired byhim. The youngerMrBarksdale washimselfﬂeetinglypor-trayed in it. (“‘The Wire’ wasa bunch ofbullshit,” he sniﬀs. “I gotshotin the fourthepisode and I didn’tgetpaid.”) Nowem-ployed bythe Baltimore health depart-ment, in a team ofgangsters-turned-socialworkersknown asSafe Streets, he uses hisstreetsmartsto tryto pre-emptmurders bymediatingamongthe local hoodlums. Thisalso giveshim a rare vantage onto the city’slatestupwellingofviolence, which is con-centrated in poor, overwhelminglyblackWestBaltimore—and ishorriﬁc. HoursafterMrBarksdale conducted hislargestincrease since 1968,” MrSessionssaid lastmonth in testimonyto the Senateintelligence committee. He neglected toclarifythat, notwithstandingthatrise, themurderrate isatclose to itslowest level in aquarterofa century. In mostplaces, Ameri-canshave neverbeen lesslikelyto be mur-dered; the homicide rate in NewYorkis be-lowthe national average. More than 55% ofthe increase lastyearwasaccounted for byChicago, where 781people were mur-dered—more than the total forNewYorkand LosAngelescombined.America isnotexperiencinga crimewave, in short, butratherhistoricprogressmarred bya fewexceptionallybleakplaces. ThatdoesnotjustifyMrSessions’scampaign forharshercustodial sentencesacrossthe board, which would notcutviolentcrime much oratall in Baltimore oranywhere. The attorney-general would dobetterto fathom whatiscausingthe bleakspots, startingwith a fewstarktruths.As American as cherrypieMostmurdervictimsin America are blackpeople shotdead byotherblackpeople.Blacksrepresent13% ofAmerica’spopula-tion, yetin 2015 theyrepresented 52% oftheslain. The toll on blackfamiliesand com-munitiesisappalling; between 1980 and2013, 262,000 blackmen were murdered inAmerica, more than fourtimesAmerica’stotal numberofcasualtiesin Vietnam. IfblackAmericanswere murdered atnomore than the national rate, Americawould still be an unusuallyviolentdevel-oped country; itsmurderrate would fallfrom the currentlevel of4.9 per100,000people, which issimilarto thatofsome Af-rican countries, to 2.4 per100,000. Thatwould make America merelythree timesasdangerousasGermany.Criminologistshave fordecadesar-tourofsome ofBaltimore’smosttroubledstreetson June 12th, theywitnessed anoth-ersixmurders. Thatraised the number ofkillingsin the cityto 159, the highestrecord-ed so earlyin the yearatleastsince 1990,even though the city’spopulation wasmuch biggerthen than itisnow. Ifweight-ed to reﬂectthe factthatthe murder rate al-waysclimbsin the hot, fractioussummermonths, thissuggestsBaltimore mayseemore than 400 murdersthisyear. Thatwould smash the existingrecord of344 kill-ings, which wassetin 2015, fuelled byviol-entriotingoverthe death in police custodyofa drugpeddlercalled Freddie Gray.Thisiscatastrophic. A50-minute drivefrom Washington, DC, blackmen aged 15 to29 are aslikelyto die violentlyasAmericansoldierswere in Iraq atthe heightof itsBaathistinsurgency. Yetthere isno sign ofMaryland orthe federal governmenttak-ingthe sortofemergencyaction such a di-sasterwould seem to justify. Instead ofbol-steringlawenforcementin Baltimore andafewotherviolentcities, including chieﬂyChicago, butalso StLouisand Milwaukee,JeﬀSessions, the attorney-general, hastried unsuccessfullyto rowbacka modestfederal-governmentintervention devisedbyhisDemocraticpredecessor. Mean-while he hasused the violence in thoseplacesto misrepresentthe much more pa-ciﬁcstate ofAmerica atlarge.“The murderrate isup over10%—theHomicide in Baltimore On murderous streetsBALTIMOREMostparts ofAmerica have neverbeen safer.

The an-swerliesin some combination ofpoverty,familyinstability, epidemicsofdrug use inthe wretched inner-citydistrictsintowhich manyblackswere corralled byrac-isthousingpolicies, and bad, ornon-exis-tent, policing. The lastofthese, which maybe the mostimportant, extendsfarbeyondoccasional instancesofpolice brutality. InAmerica’sovertlyracistpast, the killers ofblackAmericanswere lesslikelyto becaughtthan the killersofwhitesbecauseblackliveswere valued less. These days, in-adequate resources, recruitmentand train-ingofinner-citypolice oﬃcersare biggerproblems. Yetthe outcome isthe same. Inthe 1930s, Mississippi solved 30% ofblackmurders; in the early1990s, LosAngelesCounty, then in the grip ofa violent crack-cocaine epidemic, solved 36%; in 2015 thepolice in Baltimore solved 30.5% ofmur-ders, mostofwhich involved blacks. Where murderersoperate with a senseofimpunity, theyare likelyto commitmore murders. “I probablyknowtendudesrightnowwho have shotpeopleand neverbeen arrested,” saysMrBarks-dale. Anothergrim indicatorofimpunityisthat, while the numberoffatal shootingshassoared thisyear, the numberofnon-fa-tal oneshashardlyincreased. “Instead oftakinga shotand runningaway, the gun-men are walkingup and takingmultipleshotsto leave no witnessesalive,” saysCassandra Crifasi, a researcherinto gun vi-olence atBaltimore’sJohnsHopkinsBloombergSchool ofHealth. In the ab-sence ofeﬀective policing, friendsand rela-tivesofmurdervictimsare also more likelyto take the lawinto theirown hands—andso the virusspreads.The same pattern hasbeen noted inotherpoorlypoliced societies, especiallythose experiencingupheaval ortrauma.The homicide rate amongblackAmeri-cans, notesJill Leovy, a writeron murder inAmerica, issimilarto thatamongArabs insome partsofIsrael’soccupied territoriesand American frontiersmen in the 18thcentury. “Like the schoolyard bully,” shewritesin “Ghettoside”, “ourcriminal-jus-tice system harassespeople on small pre-textsbutisexposed asa coward beforemurder. Ithaulsmassesofblackmenthrough itsmachinerybutfailsto protectthem from bodilyinjuryand death.”Betterpolicingcontributed to the dropin violentcrime seen in mostAmerican cit-iesfrom the mid-1990s. The size ofitscon-tribution isunclear, however: the complex-ityoflocal circumstancesand thepatchinessofAmerica’scrime data makesaccountingforchangesin crime rates hard.Even with decadesofdata to mull over,and a listoflikelyfactorsincluding betterpolicing, strongincome growth, demo-graphicchangesand reduced alcohol con-sumption, researchersatthe Brennan Cen-tre forJustice, atNewYorkUniversity,could accountforonlyhalfofthe nationalreduction in violentcrime. Accounting forthe recentsurge in killingin Baltimore andChicago iseven harder. Yetitisstriking thatboth placeshave recentlysuﬀered a dra-maticcollapse in publictrustin the police,sparked byactsofbrutality.Loathed butneededJustasthe killingofFreddie Gray, who suf-fered a fatal spine injuryin the back ofa po-lice van, litup Baltimore, so the killing ofLaquan McDonald, anotheryoungblackman, who wasshotdead in possession ofapocket-knife, led to protestsin Chicago. Inboth casesthe police, undermanned andunsure howto comportthemselvesin aworld ofmobile-phone camerasin everypocket, retreated. Between November2015and January2016, the numberofsuspectsbrieﬂydetained in Chicago dropped by80%. In Baltimore, arrestnumbershavefallen in the pastthree years, even as themurderrate soared.Baltimore’spolice departmentwasthrown into additional disarraylastyearbya damningreportfrom the DepartmentofJustice, which concluded thatmany ofitsoﬃcerswere poorlytrained, racist andincompetent, especiallyin theirbungledeﬀortsto police poorblackneighbour-hoods. Thisﬁndingled the fedsto demandthe overwatch role thatMrSessionshastried unsuccessfullyto give up. Anotherscandal, in March, hasmade mattersworse; seven membersofan elite Balti-more police unitwere charged with rob-bingdrugdealersand law-abidingBalti-moreans, amongothercrimes. “I selldrugs,” one allegedlyboasted.Baltimore’spolice bridle atthe sugges-tion thattheyare to blame forthe city’svio-lence. Theyare atleasttryingharder. Thecase-closure rate formurdersiscurrentlyaround 50%. In response to the sixmurderson the dayofyourcorrespondent’svisittoWestBaltimore, the city’spolice commis-sioner, Kevin Davis, also announced whatamounted to a weeklongstate ofemergen-cy. He dispatched mostofthe city’s2,850police oﬃcers—includingmanypreviouslydedicated to oﬃce-work—on 12-hourpa-trols. Ifsuch eﬀortscould be sustained,theywould probablybe popular, eventhough the police are not. “No one truststhe police, no one wantsto tell them any-thing,” said Yolanda Stewart, a resident ofthe troubled Sandtown-Winchesterneigh-bourhood, whose 21-year-old nephewwasrecentlyshotand maimed outside herhouse. “Butwe need strongpolice aroundhere to protectus.”AtourofBaltimore’strouble spotsalsoevincessome sympathyforthe cops. Bet-terpolicingalone cannotcurb a majorcrime wave; though NewYork’scrime-ﬁghtingsuccessisoften attributed to animaginative crackdown on pettycrime inthe 1990s, the city’slongeconomicboomprobablyplayed a biggerpart. Bycontrast,the state ofBaltimore’spoorestneighbour-hoods, huddled on eitherside ofthe Patap-sco river, isunrelentinglydire.Whole streetshave been boarded upagainstthe junkieswho hunkermiserablyon the weedyverges. Where an occasionalinhabited house interruptsthe monotonyofabandonment, a glimpse ofcurtains orapot-plantappearsboth valiantand acutelypathetic. (“The people in these communi-tiesare doingthe besttheycan,” saysEr-icka Alston, a formeraddictwho runs amuch-praised after-school club in WestBaltimore.) The cityhasan estimated16,000 abandoned houses, some ofwhichhave lain emptysince itspreviousbig riot,in 1968, followingthe death ofMartin Lu-therKing. Mostofthe damage ismore re-cent, however. Aformersteel and manu-facturinghub, the cityhaslost75,000factoryjobssince 1990; asa result, around aquarterofBaltimoreansare stuckin pover-ty, with fewobviousexits. A25-year-longstudyof790 children in Baltimore bythesociologistKarl Alexanderand colleagues,from 1982 to 2007, found only4% ofpoorchildren made itthrough college. In Sand-town-Winchester, shortlybefore the riots,52% ofadultswere unemployed, 49% ofteenagerswere “chronicallyabsent” fromschool and a third ofhouseswere emptyorabandoned.

MrBarksdale andmanyofhisex-gangstercolleaguescuttheirteeth duringthe crack-cocaine bingeofthe late 1980sand 1990s. Many, includingMrBarksdale, are the sonsofaddicts. Un-derpinningthe latestcrime surge isa thirdepidemic, ofopioid prescription drugs,which isin some waysthe deadliestyet.Accordingto an estimate bythe healthdepartment, around 50,000 Baltimoreansare addicted to opioids. Some considerthatan exaggeration; a visitto the streetsaround Baltimore’sLexington Marketsug-gestsitmightnotbe. “See him on the bike!He’sso high he can’tride straight,” saysMrBarksdale, from behind the wheel, pickingoutthe stonerswith an experteye. Thereappearto be dozensofthem; two dealersare plainlyvisible, dishingoutthe contentoforange pillboxes. ItisprobablyPercocet,an opioid pain-reliever, with a street valueof$30 fora 30mghit. One ofthe dealers isoperatingwithin a fewfeetofa policevan—perhaps, MrBarksdale speculates,because he too isstoned. “Everyone’shigh!” he exclaims. “Youused to be ostra-cised ifyouwason drugs. Nowit’sso com-mon it’saccepted.”In the viewofMrBarksdale and his co-workers, these and otherchangesin Balti-more’sillegal drugsmarkethelp drive thekilling. The more hierarchical gangs, andregulated murders, depicted in “The Wire”were based on the relative scarcityof her-oin and cocaine; a gangsterwith a goodsupplyofthe drugsoccupied a command-ingposition. Bycontrast, the easier avail-abilityofprescription drugs—especially inthe aftermath ofthe riots, duringwhichmanypharmacieswere looted—hasled toaprofusion ofpettydealers, manyofwhom are also addicts. The resultiscon-stantturfbattleswhich, unchecked by so-briety, are especiallyliable to turn bloody. In turn, the bloodshed hasled to a gen-eral downgradingofthe value ofa life.“The normal haschanged, violence and re-taliation and pain are expected,” saysMsAlston, who estimatesthat98% ofthe 50-100 children who attend herafter-schoolclub have heard orseen someone beingshot. “Thisisaboutsix-year-oldswalkingin and saying, ‘Did youhearso and so gotshot?’” Thatsuggestsa third wayin whichviolence, which public-health experts in-creasinglyviewasanalogousto infectiousdisease, spreads.

MrBarks-dale concedesthatone ofthe problems iskeepingpeople engaged withoutdippingbackinto theirold lifestyles.

He had beenaboutto pull outofthe North AmericanFree-Trade Agreementwith Canada andMexico, he explained. Butthen he got anice call from Justin Trudeau, Canada’sprime minister, and anotherfrom the pres-ident(“good guy”) ofMexico askinghim tonegotiate: “and I am alwayswillingto ne-gotiate.” Even so, MrTrump insisted,NAFTAhasbeen veryunfairto the UnitedStates, so he will renegotiate successful-ly—orpull out. The audience applauded,butratherhesitantly. OfAmerica’stop ten farm statesbycash receiptsfrom production, sixare inthe Midwest, and Iowa rankssecond, afteronlyCalifornia. Farmershave beneﬁtedfrom NAFTA more than otherindustries,which iswhytheyare nowﬁghtinghardagainstmessingaboutwith the treaty. In1993 America exported corn, soyabeansand otherfarm productsworth $8.9bn toCanada and Mexico; by2015 farm exportswere worth $39bn. Some 30% ofall Ameri-can farm trade iswith Mexico and Canada.The top three commoditiesexported toMexico are maize (corn), soyabeansandpork; Iowa isa majorproducerofall these. On the ﬁrstdayofmarathon publichearingson the renegotiation ofNAFTAonJune 27th, held atthe oﬃcesofthe UnitedStatesTrade Representative (USTR) inWashington, Kevin Skunes, a leaderof theNational Corn GrowersAssociation, saidthatexportsaccountforfullyone-third ofcorn farmers’ income. American corn ex-portsto Canada and Mexico have in-creased more than sevenfold since 1994.Lastyeartheysupported 25,000 jobsandprovided income for300,000 farmers. NAFTAhasalso created surprisingly in-tegrated supplychains.

These werefattened up on farmsin Iowa, MinnesotaorIllinoisuntil theywere readyfor slaugh-terand processing. Manyofthe resultingporkcutletswere then exported backintoCanada.

They willbe disheartened bythe postponement, onJune 27th, ofa Senate vote on the Republi-cans’ health-care bill. The party’smoder-atescannottolerate the proposed cuts toMedicaid, the federal and state health-in-surance programme forthe poor. Underthe bill, which will nowbe amended or re-written, Medicaid’sbudgetwould havebeen 26% lowerin 2026 than currentlyforecast. “Medicaid cutshurt[the] mostvulnerable Americans,” noted SenatorSu-san CollinsofMaine, announcingherop-position. Conservative justiﬁcations forcuts—thatMedicaid hasgrown too big, andisineﬀective—mustcompete with the factthatone in ﬁve ofMsCollins’sconstituentsuse the programme. Butare the right’scom-plaintsaboutMedicaid justiﬁed?When Medicaid began in 1965, itservedtwo groups: those who also received cashwelfare from the government, and whom-everstatesdeemed to be “medicallyneedy”. Thatmostlymeantelderlyresi-dentsofnursinghomes. Butitcould bemuch broader. NewYorkincluded almosthalfitspopulation. Because the federalgovernmentpicked up overhalfthe tab, in1976 Congresstried to control costsby lim-itingcoverage to the poorand nearly-poor.In the 1980s, however, Washingtonoversawa gradual broadeningofcoverage.Forexample, Congressletstatescover chil-dren withoutregard to theirparents’means. Then itrequired statesto includepoorpregnantwomen and infants. In the1990sstateswere encouraged to tinkerwith theirprogrammes, and eligibility ex-panded furtherin some places.Bythe time BarackObama’sAﬀordableCare Actpassed in 2010, nearly55m Ameri-canswere enrolled. UnderObamacare,compliantstatesextended Medicaid toeveryone earninglessthan 138% ofthe pov-ertyline. Todayenrolmentisalmost80m,with nearly100m people usingitatsomepointduringanygiven year. Itirksmanyconservativesthatnearlyone in three Americansbeneﬁtfrom a pro-gramme ostensiblyforthe poor. Theypar-ticularlyquestion whetherable-bodied,working-age adultsshould be covered.(The Senate bill would have allowed statesto require such enrolleesto work.)Abouta quarterofMedicaid spendinggoesto working-age adults. In 2012, the lastyearforwhich data are available, only 1.4%ofthem were unemployed (though thatwasbefore Obamacare). The restofthebudgetisspenton children, the old, and es-peciallythe disabled. And since Medicaidpaysthe residential-nursingcostsof oldpeople who have run down theirassets, itfootsthe bill foralmosttwo-thirdsof theoccupantsofnursinghomes.The second conservative complaint isthatMedicaid isadministered so badlythatitmaynotbe worth havingatall. Only70% ofdoctorsacceptnewpatientsonMedicaid, compared with 91% acceptanceforthose with private insurance. This isbe-cause stateskeep on cuttingwhatthey paydoctorsunderthe programme.Medicaid seemsnotto improve somehealth measures. The bestevidence comesfrom Oregon, which in 2008 expanded itthrough a lottery. Two yearslater, thosewho beneﬁted did nothave lowerbloodpressure, cholesterol orblood sugar. Yetalackofcare wasnotto blame: visits to thedoctorwentup. Those enrolled reportedfeelinghealthier. And theywere much lesslikelyto suﬀercatastrophicﬁnancial lossesbecause ofmedical bills. Perhapsasa re-sult, ratesofdepression fell bya third.Medicaid, then, isnotuseless. But itisnotthateﬀective, either. And the huge va-riation in spendingperenrollee, fromabout$4,000 in Nevada to almost$11,000in North Dakota, takessome explaining.Proddingstatesto make Medicaid moreeﬃcientistherefore a worthygoal. Itmightmean stateshave to footmore ofthe bill forthe programme. The trickismakingsuretheydo notrespond byabandoningthevulnerable. AsRepublicansredrafttheirbill, theyshould rememberthat. 7MedicaidPatchingup the poorWASHINGTON, DCWhateverhappens to the Republicans’ health-care bill, Medicaid needs reformThe EconomistJuly1st2017 UnitedStates33INMARCH 2016, ata dismayingmomentin the election cam-paign (there were a few), the Republican Speakerofthe HouseofRepresentatives, Paul Ryan, urged a gatheringofcongressionalinternsto recall the “beautiful” experimentthatcreated America.This, MrRyan told the youngsters, isthe onlynation founded noton an identitybuton an idea, namely: “thatthe condition ofyourbirth doesnotdetermine the outcome ofyourlife.” Concedingthatmodern politicsmightseem consumed with “insults” and“ugliness”, the Speakerinsisted thatthiswasnotthe Americanway. The Foundersdetermined thattheirnoble idea could be up-held onlywith reasoned debate, notforce. MrRyan cited the ﬁrstofthe FederalistPapers, and AlexanderHamilton’scounsel thatinpoliticsitis“absurd” to make converts“byﬁre and sword”.He wasdrawingon a rich rhetorical tradition. Browse throughschool historybooks, with nameslike “LibertyorDeath!”, andthe struggle to throwoﬀBritish rule issanctiﬁed as a victoryofAmerican patriot-farmersand artisansagainstbattle-hardenedBritish redcoatsand foreign mercenaries, defendingidealscrafted byoratorsin periwigs. Yetgo backto contemporarysources, and theycalled itwhatitalso was: a brutal civil war.Thatisthe unsparinghistorytold in a ﬁne newbook, “ScarsofIndependence: America’sViolentBirth” byHolgerHoockoftheUniversityofPittsburgh. Intrigued bymonumentsto Loyalist ex-ilesand martyrsin English churches, MrHoockduginto long-for-gotten archivesand eyewitnessaccounts. He concluded that se-lective amnesia tookhold soon afterthe war, asvictors told theirversion ofhistory, and the British displayed theirgenius forfor-gettingdefeats. In the republic’searliestdecades, stone monu-mentschargingthe British with “cold-blooded cruelty” rose onbattle sitesfrom Lexington, Massachusettsto Paoli, Pennsylvania.Meanwhile oratorstold Americansthattheirrevolthad beenunusuallycivilised: one publicmeetingin 1813 declared the revo-lution “untarnished with a single blood-speckofinhumanity”.By1918, with America ﬁghtingin a world waron the Britishside, itcould be riskyeven to accuse George III’sforcesofbrutal-ity. RobertGoldstein, a German-American ﬁlm producerin LosAngeles, wastried and imprisoned forinciting“hatred ofEng-land” with “The Spiritof’76”, a silentepicaboutthe revolution-arywarwhich depicted British troopsbayonetinga baby and as-saultingwomen. Acourtscorned the ﬁlm-maker’splea thattheinfant-stabbingsoldierswere notBritish, butHessian auxiliaries.In time the warwasreimagined asa momentofunity, whenthe North wasbound in a common cause with the South. In 1930tensofthousandsheard PresidentHerbertHoovermarkthe 150thanniversaryofthe Battle ofKing’sMountain, in South Carolina,where in hiswordsa “small band ofPatriotsturned backa dan-gerousinvasion” thattried to divide the united colonies.Itistrue thatthe warwasdriven bystirringideals. The Foun-derswere atpainsto showthattheirrebellion wasin defence, notdeﬁance, ofnatural lawand the inalienable rightsofman. Ascommanderofthe continental army, George Washington soughtto out-civilise the British, harshlypunishingtroopswho robbedciviliansorabused captives, forinstance. Still, this revolution wasnotuntarnished byblood-specks. MrHoock, a German-born historian, isdispassionate as he re-cordscrueltiesnotonlybythe British, butalso bythe Americanswho foughton opposingsidesasLoyalistsand aspro-indepen-dence Patriots. Forall Hoover’stalkofinvadersbeingcrushed atKing’sMountain, the battle wasthe war’slargestall-Americanﬁght, involvinga single British participant, a Scottish militia com-mander. Civiliansknewterrors, too. Patriotsformed “committeesofsafety” to demand loyaltyoathsfrom neighbourssuspected ofsympathyforthe Crown. MrHoockdigsup detailed accounts ofLoyalistsbeingvariouslyostracised, tarred and feathered, chokedwith pigmanure, branded with GR(forGeorge Rex) and lynched.Anglican churcheshad windowssmashed and several priestswere killed. Loyalists’ businesseswere attacked, and theirproper-tyconﬁscated. Bookswere burned. Brotherfoughtbrother, andfathersdisowned sons—amongthem Benjamin Franklin, a Foun-derwho wasneverreconciled with hisLoyalistson, William, thelastcolonial governorofNewJersey. Atthe war’send, aboutonein 40 Americanswentinto permanentexile, the equivalent ofsome 8m people today.The British treated prisonersvilely. More than halfof theAmericansheld on British prison shipsanchored oﬀBrooklyndied ofstarvation ordisease. Racial tensionsforeshadowed thosethatwould tearAmerica apartin the civil war, decades later. Co-lonial governorssoughtto recruitrunawayslavesto their side.When southern Patriotscaughta 15-year-old girl ﬂeeingslavery tojoin the British, the bookrecords, she waslashed 80 times; hotemberswere then poured on herlacerated back, asan example toothers. Native Americanssuﬀered cruelly: Washington orderedthe “devastation” ofIroquoisnationsallied with Britain.No July4th picnicThe crueltydid notstop with peace in 1783. Hamilton, a formeraide to Washington and a proud Patriot, warned againstpoliticalviolence in the FederalistPapersfora reason. Three yearsbeforethe papercited byMrRyan, Hamilton wrote a letterto his fellow-citizens, expressingalarm thatformerLoyalistsin New Yorkfacedpersecution asa resultof“the little vindictive selﬁsh mean pas-sionsofa few”. MrRyan’spep talkhad a noble aim: assuringyoungsters thatwhen demagoguespractice identitypoliticsorwinkatcam-paign-trail violence, theyare betrayingthe Founders’ cerebral ide-als. Alas, real historyismessierthan that. Alongside high-mindeddebate, a greatnation’sbirth-painsincluded sectarian rage andpolitical terror. Those who would restore civilityto politicsshould reckon, honestly, with thatlegacy.7Divided, even atbirthAnewhistoryofthe American revolution revives memories ofviolence and terrorLexington34The EconomistJuly1st20171IFLOCATIONwere all thatmattered, theRapid Lake FirstNation reserve in Que-becwould be a paradise.

In a country suﬀer-ingfrom lowoil pricesand risingpovertyand fed up with corruption, the assemblygenerated enthusiasm. Both itsconvokingand the newconstitution, which extend-ed citizens’ rightsaswell asthe presi-dent’spowers, were backed bybigmajor-itiesin referendums.Constitutions, like diamonds, are sup-posed to last. Butthatisnotthe view ofNi-colásMaduro, a formerbusdriverchosenbya dyingChávezto replace him as presi-dentin 2013. He hasordered a newconstit-uentassembly, to be chosen on July 30th.Everythingaboutthe processisdiﬀerentfrom 1999. In violation ofChávez’sconsti-tution, ithasbeen called bypresidentialdecree ratherthan byreferendum. MrMaduro saysitspurpose isto de-featthe opposition’s“fascism”. Yetitwillbe chosen undera system thatmight havebeen devised byMussolini. Each ofthe340 municipalitieswill electone assem-blymember, regardlessofsize (only statecapitalswill gettwo), meaningthe oppo-sition-supportingcitiesare under-repre-sented. Afurther181memberswill be cho-sen from communal and occupationalgroupscontrolled bythe regime.MrMaduro wantsthe assemblybe-cause he can no longerstayin powerdemocratically. Lowoil pricesand mis-managementhave exacted a heavytoll.Food and medicinesare scarce; diseaseslongcurbed, such asdiphtheria and ma-laria, are killingonce more. The opposi-tion won a bigmajorityin a legislativeelection in 2015. Since then MrMadurohasruled bydecree and through the pup-petsupreme court. In almostdailyoppo-sition protestssince April, 75 people havebeen killed, manyshotbythe NationalGuard orpro-regime armed gangs. MrMaduro’slurch to dictatorship hasopened cracksin hispolitical base. LuisaOrtega, the attorney-general and long achavista, hasbecome an outspoken critic.The constituentassemblywill “completethe deﬁnitive dismantlingofdemocracy”,she told a Peruvian newspaperthisweek.Itsapparentpurpose isto turn Venezuelainto a dictatorship alongCuban lines. Al-readyMrMaduro hasinstituted a Cuban-style rationingsystem with food parcelsdelivered bythe armed forces. The assem-bly, oﬃcialssay, will assume sovereignpower—and sackMsOrtega.Alastopportunityto applydiplomaticpressure failed lastmonth ata meeting offoreign ministersofthe Organisation ofAmerican States, held in Cancún. The Mex-ican hoststhoughttheyhad more than the23 votesneeded (outof34) to condemnVenezuela. Theygotonly20, asMrMadu-ro’sdiplomatswon overwaveringCarib-bean mini-stateswith threatsto cutoﬀcheap oil. The outcome, saysa Latin Amer-ican diplomat, depended on howmuchpressure the United Stateswasprepared toputon the Caribbean. Notenough: Rex Til-lerson, the secretaryofstate, stayed awayto deal with Qatar. Though Venezuela ismore isolated than everin itsregion, MrMaduro could claim a kind ofvictory. Even had the motion passed, itmighthave changed little. The onlypotential ob-staclesto MrMaduro’sgambitare on hisown side. Manychavistasoppose the con-stituentassembly. “Democraticchavismoissigniﬁcantin termsofpopularsenti-ment,” saysDavid Smilde, a VenezuelaspecialistatTulane University. “Butit’scompletelydisorganised.” Althoughthere have been intermittentprotests inchavistaareasofCaracas, usuallyoverfood shortages, the opposition hasfailedto linkup with dissidentsfrom the regimein a trulynational protestmovement.The armed forces, which sustain MrMaduro in power, have wavered butnotbent—so far, atleast. Several retired gener-alswho were close to Chávezhave criti-cised the idea ofa newassembly. At least14 junioroﬃcershave been arrested sincethe protestsbegan. On June 20th the pres-identstripped the defence minister, Gen-eral Vladimiro Padrino, ofthe powerfulpostofthe operational commanderof thearmed forces. To some analysts, thislooked like an expression ofmistrust. Tension isrising. On June 27th apoliceoﬃcerin a helicopterbuzzed the supremecourtand interiorministry. Apro-govern-mentmob attacked the parliament, andlarge-scale lootingtookplace in Maracay,westofCaracas.MrMaduro and hiscircle lackthe auraofheroism thatoriginallysurrounded Fi-del Castro. “Ifchavista Venezuela wasacaricature ofthe Cuban revolution, Ma-duro isa caricature ofthe caricature,” saysthe Latin American diplomat.

Itwasaudacious, relatively, callingSaddam Hus-sein a “dictator” and allowingIsraelisonthe air. Dissidents, Islamistsand pan-Arabnationalistswere given a platform. Thechannel wasindeed “a voice forthe voice-less”, asitclaimed. While vexingthe re-gion’scensors, itwon awards. More telling-ly, ithasatone time oranotherbeen kickedoutofnearlyeverycountryin the region.Butthe station hasalso welcomed, andchampioned, extremistviewpoints.

But itscoverage ofthe uprisingsmarked a turn-ing-point. Itsreportersbeamed outlive im-agesfrom raucousprotests. The channelbecame the primarysource ofinformationforparticipantsand observers. Al Jazeera’sweb traﬃcincreased by2,500% duringtherevolution in Egypt, despite the govern-mentransackingitsCairo bureau. “Longlive Al Jazeera!” chanted protestersin Tah-rirSquare.Qatar’sneighbourswere notnearlyasthrilled with the station. Theyfeared thatthe uprisingsmightspread to the Gulf. AlJazeera’sfavourable coverage ofvictoriousIslamists, such asthe Muslim Brotherhoodin Egypt, furtheralienated the Gulfrulers,who see the group asa threat. Ithas alsoled to criticism thatAl Jazeera isfollowingQatar’slead, atthe expense ofitseditorialintegrity. The station takespositions “notbased on journalisticpriorities, but ratheron the interestsofthe foreign ministry ofQatar,” said Aktham Suliman, a formercorrespondent, afterquittingin 2012.Al Jazeera continuesto oﬀend. When 12Saudi soldierswere killed in Yemen inApril, the station failed to referto them as“martyrs”, enragingRiyadh. ItangerstheEgyptiansbyreferringto the removal ofthe Brotherhood bythe armyin 2013, asa“coup”, which itwas. The station has alsogiven favourable coverage to Jabhatal-Nusra, the al-Qaeda aﬃliate in Syria.SinceQatar’sexpulsion from the Saudi-led co-alition ﬁghtingin Yemen, Al Jazeera’sre-portingon the warhasgrown more critical.Itnowhighlightsthe bombingofciviliansand a cholera epidemicexacerbated by theﬁghting.

The power of groupthink

Obser vers of Donald Trump’s presidency who hope that Amer ican
politics will eventually return to normal may face a long wait, says
John Pr ideaux

“IT’S A WONDERFUL day under President Trump! Please leave a mes-
sage,” chirps the answerphone at the Palm Beach Republican Club,
which sits on a palm-tree-lined avenue with a crossroads at one end and
the turquoise Atlantic at the other. If Mar-a-Lago is Versailles, then this is
its local village, whose inhabitants get occasional glimpses of the royal
carriages. There is nothing downtrodden about the area. West Palm
Beach, the nearest town, has a McLaren dealership and is patrolled by bi-
cycle-mounted “Security Ambassadors”.
Palm Beach is about as diﬀerent from rural Kansas as it is possible to
be, yet the way the president’s supporters talk about him in both places is
much the same: he’s a businessman, he’s trying to do the right thing, Con-
gress is getting in his way, the media are painting him as a bad man which
he’s not, and anyway the country was a disaster under Obama. In the
time your correspondent spent in West Virginia, Kansas, Georgia, Ala-
bama and Florida talking to mayors of small towns, local Republican
Party bosses and ordinary folk who voted for the president, nobody
spontaneously raised the lingering scandal over Russian meddling in the
presidential election, and hardly anybody showed buyer’s remorse.
Go back 50 years, and if you knew someone’s income, you could
predict, with reasonable accuracy, how they would vote. That is no lon-
ger true (see chart on the next page). From Florida’s golf courses to rural
Appalachia, from Midwestern blue-collar suburbs to California’s bou-
gainvillea-lined driveways, where some of the most prominent pro-
Trump intellectuals grew up, the tribes that make up the president’s sup-
port are bound together by something powerful that has little to do with

their economic fortunes.
To be fair, not everybody in America
thinks it’s a wonderful day under Presi-
dent Trump. Plenty of people have
watched the 45th president’s progress
since his inauguration—from the “Ameri-
can carnage” speech to the ﬁring of the FBI
director, James Comey, from the courting
of authoritarian leaders abroad to the
continuing mingling of business interests
and power—and concluded that this pres-
ident is a threat to the republic. This spe-
cial report is not about them. Rather, it is
about the roughly 40% or so of voters—
some 50m Americans—who have lived
through the same events and like what
they see. According to Gallup, a polling or-
ganisation, that is the share who ap-
proved of the president a week after his
inauguration. Five months into his ad-
ministration, which has felt like a period
of extraordinary turbulence to those fol-
lowing events closely, Trump voters are
less enthusiastic than they were, but that
headline approval number has declined
by only a couple of percentage points.
Of this group, about half say they strongly support Mr
Trump and are with the president no matter what. That is the
share of voters, about 20%, who told YouGov, The Economist’s
pollster, that it is a good idea for the president to appoint family
members to positions in the White House, for example. Those
who take him from a 20% approval rating to one closer to 40% are
the ones he needs to stick by him. If you understand how they
think about politics and what can change their minds, you can
sketch the boundaries of the president’s support or, as his detrac-
tors might put it, what he can get away with.
The ﬁrst thing to note is that most voters pay little attention.
Those who follow politics tend to assume that everyone else
does, too, but they are mistaken. According to the American Na-
tional Election Study (ANES), a large survey run by Stanford and
the University of Michigan and published in March, 94% of
Trump voters did not attend a single political rally, speech or
meeting last year. The ﬁgure for Clinton voters is 90%. The survey
is considered the most rigorous study of what goes on in voters’
heads when they cast their ballot. (All the numbers on public
opinion in what follows come from the ANES, unless otherwise
stated.) Only about a ﬁfth of Americans pay close attention to
politics, and they tend to be the most committed conservatives
or liberals. For the rest, political issues are little more than “a side-
show in the great circus of life”, wrote Robert Dahl, a political sci-
entist, in 1961. That remains true. Americans do not trust govern-
ment much and expect politicians to lie; 31% of Trump voters and
36% of Clinton voters think that the American government
“probably” or “deﬁnitely” knew about 9/11 in advance.

Wishful thinking

So how do the vast majority of voters change their minds?
Not by taking each issue, deciding what is important to them, de-
termining which candidate is closer to their preferences and then
voting accordingly. In “Democracy for Realists”, the most inﬂu-
ential recent book on voting, Christopher Achen and Larry Bar-
tels show that the opposite often happens: people may well de-
cide which candidate they like and then ascribe policies they
approve of to him or her, often incorrectly. Each presidential-elec-
tion year the ANES asks voters to place themselves on a spectrum

with “many more services” on the left to “reduce spending a lot”
on the right, and then to place the two main political parties
somewhere on that spectrum. About 15% decline, or say they
have not thought about it. The same number, more or less, will
place themselves but cannot place the parties, meaning that 30%
of the electorate does not have a good sense of where Republi-
cans and Democrats stand on the most fundamental question
about the role of the state.
Of those who do answer, quite a few have a weak grasp of
the parties’ governing philosophies. After the election, defeated
Democrats spent some time fretting over the 80,000 votes they
lost in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, handing Mr
Trump a win in the electoral college. They wondered whether
the FBI’s late intervention on Mrs Clinton’s e-mails swung the
election. But a far larger number of voters did not really know
what either party stood for. The ANES also asks voters whether
the Republicans or Democrats are more conservative, and found
that some 15% of Trump voters thought the Democrats were the
more conservative party (as did 6% of Clinton voters). Add in the
don’t knows, and 16% of Clinton voters and 24% of Trump voters
were not sure which party was more conservative. 
How is this possible in a
country that
is, as is often
pointed out, highly polarised
between conservatives and
liberals? Only if a large num-
ber of people, rather than pick-
ing the party that best ﬁts their
own political views, are decid-
ing on some other criteria—
which is what they seem to be
doing. Sometimes voters imag-
ine that one of the parties ﬁts
their world view when it does
not. Sometimes they adapt
their preferences in order to ﬁt
the candidate or party they
like. This can happen even on
issues that voters think of as

non-negotiable. Abortion is one of those, particularly for wom-
en and Catholics, for some of whom this has the highest priority.
Yet according to an analysis by Mssrs Achen and Bartels of a
study in which the same voters were re-interviewed year after
year, about half of men who were anti-abortion and voted
Democrat in 1982 had become pro-choice Democrats 15 years lat-
er, changing their position to align it with their party’s thinking. A
more recent ﬂip comes from white evangelical voters, who sup-
ported candidate Trump by the same margin by which they sup-
ported George W. Bush, himself a white evangelical (see box).
This is not to pick on Trump voters or evangelicals: the same
is true of Democrats, as the abortion example shows. Most vot-
ers make political choices based largely on what people like
them are doing, and rarely change their minds. For example, it is
hard to think of two more diﬀerent candidates, in temperament,
style and policy, than Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, yet more
than 90% of those who voted for Mr Romney in the presidential
election in 2012 also voted for Mr Trump this time, according to
the ANES. The same share of Obama voters also backed Hillary
Clinton. Those who expect Republican voters to desert Mr
Trump each time a scandal breaks should bear this in mind.

Partisan reﬂexes often get blamed for whatever is currently
going wrong in Washington. But partisanship works in part be-
cause it is such a helpful mental shortcut. Take the repeal of the
Aﬀordable Care Act, or Obamacare, by the House of Representa-
tives, says Mr Bartels. Repealing the law is bound to have sub-
stantial eﬀects on people’s lives, but measuring those eﬀects
against a background of changing social conditions, health-in-
surance markets and medical technology would be tricky even
for a health economist, let alone for a moderately well-informed
voter. “So why not accept the judgment of people you trust?”
This kind of groupthink is so powerful that it shapes the
way people see the world around them. Right after the election,
and more than two months before Mr Trump took oﬃce, Repub-
licans told pollsters that their personal ﬁnances were in much
better shape than they had been the week before the ballot.
Democrats said the opposite. The question had nothing to do
with politics, and yet the answers given were somehow condi-
tioned by the election. To understand how this can happen, com-
pare and contrast two congressional districts: the one that is
heading Republican fastest, and its Democratic counterpart.
Conveniently, they are less than 200 miles apart. 7

Revelations

The importance of personal morality in politics is negotiable

TEN MINUTES BEFORE the Sunday morning
service begins at the Free Chapel in Gaines-
ville, Georgia, shuttle buses are ferrying
worshippers from the nor th and south car
parks to the church’s 3,000-seat auditor ium.
Newcomers are being welcomed with coﬀee
and doughnuts in the Connections Lounge.
Inside, the church is equipped with a lighting
r ig and sound system as for a gig by a sof t-
rock band. Most of the service is taken up
with Chr istian pop, the congregation listen-
ing rather than singing along. This Pentecos-
tal church has grown rapidly over the past
decade, thanks to its char ismatic pastor,
Jentezen Franklin (pictured). It now has
several campuses around the country, funded
by the tithes paid by regular churchgoers. Mr
Franklin is a member of Donald Trump’s
evangelical advisory board.
Back in 2011, white evangelicals were
the most likely group to say that personal
morality was impor tant in a president, ac-
cording to the Public Religion Research
Institute. Since Mr Trump became the Repub-
lican standard-bearer, they have become the
least likely group to say that, changing what
seems like a fundamental issue of morality to
accommodate their suppor t for the president.
One possible explanation for this swif t
change of hear t is that many of those who
identify themselves in surveys as evangelicals
are not as religious as they seem. But Greg
Smith of the Pew Research Centre says that
idea is not suppor ted by Pew’s polling of
diﬀerent religious groups, which shows that

most self-descr ibed evangelicals are fairly
observant. According to Pew, the president’s
approval rating among white evangelicals is
close to 80%, even though some of the youn-
ger ones are appalled by him. 
How do evangelicals explain their
suppor t for a thr ice-marr ied adulterer whose
biographers have not found a man preoccu-
pied with his salvation? “He doesn’t pretend
to be anything he’s not,” says Ed Henry, a
state senator for Alabama. Mr Henry is one of
a number of Alabama lawmakers who spent
months pursuing his state’s governor (him-
self a prominent Baptist) for cover ing up an
extramar ital aﬀair. He sees no conﬂict be-
tween this and suppor t for Mr Trump. Other
evangelicals mention the appointment of Neil

Gorsuch to the Supreme Cour t as evidence
that what they perceive as a long assault on
them from the judicial branch is now over.
In the Free Chapel, Mr Franklin is re-
counting a recent visit to the White House for
dinner. Cheers and applause greet the ﬁrst
mention of the president’s name. “I’m so glad
that the Lord’s Prayer is being prayed in the
White House,” he tells the congregation.
Most of his sermon does not touch on politics;
instead, he uses the visit to the White House
to show what can happen when the faithful
throw oﬀ self-doubt. He returns to the presi-
dent at the end. “I prophesy that God will
open big doors for his people in 2017,” he
declares, before sending the faithful out,
squinting in the br ight Georgia sunshine.

Urban-rural divides

Taking out the white
trash

Mutual incomprehension between urban and rural
Amer ica can border on malice

ACCORDING TO THE Cook Political Report, which ranks
every district in Congress by voters’ strength of support for
one party or the other, Virginia’s eighth district is heading Demo-
cratic faster than any other in the country. This does not mean
that it is changing from Republican to Democrat. Virginia 08 is
Democratic already, just becoming even more so. The man
charged with stopping this momentum for the beneﬁt of the Re-
publicans is Jim Presswood, head of the Arlington county Re-
publican committee. Mr Presswood is an environmental activist
who once worked for the Natural Resources Defence Council, an
NGO. He has a pronounced interest in the sort of changes to
farming championed by the farm-to-table movement. These are
not typical preoccupations among Republican activists, but Mr
Presswood voted for Mr Trump, mainly because he could not
support a pro-choice candidate. In this district over 100,000 peo-
ple work for the government, and Mr Trump lost it by miles.
“Drain the swamp was a tough message for us,” muses Mr Press-
wood. “This is the swamp.”
Virginia 08 takes in Arlington, which includes the pretty
18th-century town that was already there when Washington, DC,
was built just across the Potomac. The district’s Democratic con-
gressman, Don Beyer, used to run a family car dealership (Volvo,
naturally) and was appointed ambassador to Switzerland and
Liechtenstein after collecting money for Barack Obama’s cam-
paign in 2008. This is the sort of CV that resonates with voters in
northern Virginia, an area dotted with independent coﬀee shops
serving customers who use words like “artisanal”. An impres-
sive 30% of over-25s have postgraduate degrees, compared with
12% nationally. Across America, education levels have become
much stronger predictors than income of how people will vote.
Hillary Clinton did much better in America’s 50 most educated
districts than Mr Obama did, and performed far worse than he
did in the 50 least educated. People with postgraduate qualiﬁca-
tions tend to buy houses next to others like them, just as those
with less schooling tend to cluster together.
The district that is heading fastest in the opposite direction,
according to Cook Political, is West Virginia’s third congressional
district, in the south-east of the neighbouring state. Downtown
Huntington, the district’s biggest town with a population of
about 50,000, is almost as agreeable as Arlington on a bright
spring day, the Ohio river lazing by and some ancient rolling
stock converted into a yoga studio. Visitors with funny accents
are quickly told that Huntington has been voted America’s best
community. Sadly this is not the town’s only distinction. West
Virginia also leads the nation in deaths from drug poisoning. An
estimated one in ten babies born in the local hospital emerge ad-
dicted to opioids. 
West Virginia 03 is also a diﬃcult place to be a Democrat.
The party has “become toxic to the level where you don’t even
want to talk about it”, says Bill Bissett, who heads Huntington’s
chamber of commerce, slipping out of one of the town’s liberal
enclaves (an espresso bar) to talk freely about West Virginia’s en-
thusiasm for Mr Trump. The district’s political leanings are relat-
ed to its economic history (this is coal country), which is related
to the drug abuse, though the connections are not as clear-cut as

United States, Democrats’ lead
over Republicans in presidential
elections, by education level

they seem at ﬁrst sight.
West Virginia has gone
from reliably Democratic to
safe territory for Republicans
in presidential elections with-
in a generation. The long prior
attachment to the Democrats
dates from the state’s role as a
birthplace of organised labour
in America. At the battle of
Blair Mountain in 1921, 3,000
policemen faced oﬀ against
10,000 armed union members
in what remains the biggest
confrontation between work-
ers and the state in America’s
history. Union strength kept
West Virginia mostly Demo-
cratic; between 1932 and 1996 the state voted Republican in only
three presidential elections. West Virginia’s coal production
peaked in 1997 and its political complexion changed soon after-
wards. In 2000 the state backed George W. Bush, and has voted
Republican in presidential elections ever since. Drug abuse
spread around the same time: painkillers at ﬁrst, then powdered
white heroin and now fentanyl. As part of a Pulitzer-prizewin-
ning series, the Charleston Gazette-Mail discovered that between
2007 and 2012 a single pharmacy in Kermit, a town of 400 people
in West Virginia 03, ordered close to 9m hydrocodone pills.
On the face of it, then, this is a straightforward story of eco-
nomic misery leading voters to ditch one political party and em-
brace another. But the reality is more complicated. Since the “war
on poverty” was launched by Lyndon Johnson just over 50 years
ago with an eye on Appalachia, the income gap between that re-
gion and the rest of America has narrowed. In 1970, now remem-
bered as some sort of golden age, 14% of households in Appala-
chia lacked indoor plumbing; now just 3% do. Coal production in
West Virginia, though well short of its peak, is higher now than it
was in the 1970s. The drugs story is also more convoluted than it
seems at ﬁrst sight: painkiller abuse took root when mining was
still booming, and West Virginians took a lot of Valium before the
opioids arrived. 

Deaths of despair

Yet as the region has grown richer, it has also grown sicker,
and more people are dying from suicide, heart disease and drug
overdoses—the “deaths of despair” identiﬁed in recent studies by
two economists, Anne Case and Sir Angus Deaton, that have
brought down life expectancy in West Virginia 03. In McDowell
county, in the south-eastern corner of West Virginia 03, male life
expectancy is 12 years lower than the national average and 16.5
years lower than in Arlington. As in other poor white parts of
America, the sickening has been accompanied by the decay in in-
stitutions that regulated private lives and perhaps made hard-
ship more bearable. Both marriage and churchgoing have be-
come much less common.
The decline of coalmining in West Virginia is mainly due to
the fall in the coal price, the exhaustion of the most accessible
coal seams and the development of more eﬃcient, mechanised
mines in Wyoming. But that is not how the change is understood
in the district. Even those who have nothing to do with the min-
ing business tend to perceive it as a deliberate choice made by an
uncaring elite in places like Arlington that values the lives of chil-
dren yet to be born more highly than those of present-day West
Virginians (which, in fairness, it probably does). Evan Jenkins,
the congressman for the third district, switched from Democratic 

1

to Republican, explaining that West Virginia was under attack
from a Democratic Party “that our grandparents would no longer
recognise”. He was rewarded by the biggest winning margin in
the country in 2014, unseating Nick Rahall, a Democrat who had
been in Congress for 38 years.
That sense of being part of a victimised group is powerful
stuﬀ in politics, more potent than well-meaning schemes to im-
prove rural internet access or to expand health insurance. John
Shelton Reed, a (white Southern) sociologist, describes the con-
dition of a white Southerner as a perpetual sense of being unfair-
ly treated and looked down on. West Virginia, which sided with
the Union in the civil war, is not in the South, but a lot of its voters
now think like Shelton Reid’s Southerners.
Most people who live in northern Virginia will not in fact
make sneering jokes about West Virginia, because educated lib-
erals tend to see poverty as a product of circumstance and hence
not funny. Urban prejudice against rural dwellers, such as it is,
operates less consciously. People who include listening to coun-
try music among their pastimes are much less likely to get called
for interview at elite white-collar ﬁrms than those who say they
like sailing, according to an experiment conducted by Lauren Ri-
vera at Kellogg business school. “It’s not just that poor whites are
dying, it’s that they are dying and being told to check their privi-
lege,” says Frank Buckley, a law professor at George Mason Uni-
versity who helped to write campaign speeches for Mr Trump.
However prevalent such attitudes may be in Arlington, ru-
ral Americans have ampliﬁed them, turning them into some-
thing deﬁning. “Well if they had their way/They’d have thrown
us away”, sings Chris Jansen in “White Trash”. In the song Mr Jan-
sen—who led the Republican National Convention in a chorus
of “Trump Yeah!”—gets the girl in the end, proving that white
trash are no worse than anybody else, and maybe even a little
better. The song is more euphoric than mournful; the indignant
grievance it describes is enjoyable. A growing number of Ameri-
cans are singing along to it. According to the University of Chica-
go’s General Social Survey, the share who describe themselves
as lower-class has risen over the past decade.
If kicking back at people who think they are superior is so
deﬁning, then why do West Virginia’s voters favour a billionaire
New Yorker promising tax cuts for the wealthy? This seems
strange only to those who think voting is a branch of account-
ancy. Joan C. Williams, author of “White Working Class”, points

out that its members tend to resent professionals with their col-
lections of diplomas but admire the rich. “The dream is not to be-
come upper-middle-class, with its diﬀerent food, family and
friendship patterns,” she writes; “the dream is to live in your
own class milieu, where you feel comfortable—just with more
money.” The ideal is to own your own business so you no longer
have to take orders from anyone, just like the president. 

Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it’s oﬀ to work we go

Arlington’s voters wonder how West Virginia’s could fall
for a candidate who tells them that he will bring the coal jobs
back, as if the spot price of coal can be set by executive order. Yet
even those who suspect that coal is not about to make a come-
back give the president points for taking their side against those
uncaring city-dwellers. “We haven’t had a president say he
wants to put coalminers back to work since Carter,” says Mr Bis-
sett in Huntington. “People notice.” And there are even some
signs that coalmining is picking up here: men in reﬂecting jackets
are a common sight at McDonald’s again, and companies that
sell supplies to the mines report increased sales. For that, the lo-
cals have China rather than Mr Trump to thank: since the govern-
ment in Beijing instructed miners to limit their working days to
276 per year instead of 330, the price of metallurgical coal (the
kind used for making steel rather than in power stations) has
picked up. Even if this turns out to be a blip, those expecting vot-
ers to turn away from the president because he has not kept his
promise could be waiting for a long time. They are more likely to
blame the people in Arlington for thwarting him.
To be a Republican in West Virginia 03 is to be on the right
side of a social divide that does not have a lot to do with policies.
Some non-Republicans also manage it. The state’s Democrat go-
vernor, Jim Justice, is West Virginia’s wealthiest man, his family
fortune made in coal and farming, and a newcomer to politics.
When the Republican statehouse presented him with its budget
in April, he called a press conference at which he lifted a silver lid
to reveal a large pile of bull manure sitting on top of the budget.
In May the governor invited Donald Trump junior to the state to
ﬁsh and hunt. They did not get any wild turkeys but caught a few
rainbow trout and posed together in hunting camouﬂage. Like
the president, the governor owns a golf course and resort, the
Greenbrier, which he rescued from ﬂooding and ﬁnancial diﬃ-
culty. He sold his family’s mines and then bought them back a
few years later for a tenth of what he had
been paid for them. Being both of the peo-
ple and extremely rich has allowed him to
resist the tide that swept away so many
other Democrats.
Virginia’s eighth and West Virginia’s
third districts are the most extreme exam-
ples of what is happening, but more and
more places in America are becoming like
them. In 1992 just 39% of Americans lived
in districts where a presidential candidate
won more than 60% of the vote. By 2006
the ﬁgure had gone up to 61%. Bill Bishop’s
book “The Big Sort”, published in 2008,
which drew attention to the way Ameri-
cans are clustering in like-minded com-
munities, conjures up images of Republi-

hoods, but the world view of Trump supporters in Palm Beach is
closer to West Virginia 03 than to upscale Arlington.
If this divide were just over things like what kind of health
care government should provide, it would be easier to cross. But
the rift goes deeper than that. “It has become socially unaccept-
able not to be a partisan,” says Lee Drutman, a political scientist
at New America, a think-tank. The Pew Research Centre has
found that a quarter of consistent conservatives and liberals
would be unhappy if their children were to marry someone
from the other side of the divide. Kathy Cramer of the University
of Wisconsin-Madison followed the same groups of voters in
Wisconsin from 2007 to 2012 and wrote about her ﬁndings in
“The Politics of Resentment”. This is how she describes the atmo-
sphere during a heated recall referendum that was won by Go-
vernor Scott Walker: “People stole yard signs from each other.
They stopped talking to one another. They spat on each other.
They even tried to run each other over, even if they were married
to one another. I am not kidding.” Liberals and conservatives can
sometimes recognise each other just by their names. A study by
researchers at the University of Chicago of half a million Califor-
nian baby names found that conservatives favoured harder-
edged names. Kurt’s parents were probably conservative, Ash-
ton’s liberal.
Such non-political things shape what people think about
big political questions, like when to go to war or how much to
tax. Political attitudes are not ﬁxed. They can adapt to ﬁt what-
ever the head of the tribe is saying. Mr Trump mixes many ideas
that have not been oﬀered before in the same package. And his
shortcomings tend to be discounted as irrelevant, or put down to
inexperience or a hostile press. 7

Big-government conservatism

A town called Liberal

The birthplace of populism supports President
Trump’s policy of lower taxes with more protection 

THE PLAINS OF south-west Kansas are so ﬂat that, looking
towards the horizon, it sometimes seems possible to detect
the curvature of the Earth. This is a place of mile-long freight
trains, cathedral-like grain silos, occasional tornadoes and hom-
ages to “The Wizard of Oz”. The town of Liberal is said to have
been named for an early settler famous among travellers for be-
ing free with drinking water. Liberal is conservative in a moder-
ate Midwestern kind of way. It is also changing fast. Its big Na-
tional Beef Packing plant relies on Hispanic migrants. Four-ﬁfths
of the children in Liberal’s public-school system are Hispanic.
This should make the town receptive to Democrats, but Mr
Trump easily won the county of which it forms part.
Liberal’s mayor, Joe Denoyer, is a disc jockey at the local ra-
dio station, playing country music and taking calls from listeners
in the morning, then hanging up his headphones to sell advertis-
ing in the afternoon. He was raised in a Democratic family near
Chicago and moved to Liberal in search of work. Asked about his
political conversion, he recalls being impressed when Ronald
Reagan joked about an assassination attempt on him, and later
told Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down that wall”. Mr Denoyer
voted for Mr Trump, though he thinks it unlikely that the presi-
dent will keep his promises. Being mayor means getting into the
weeds of local politics: halfway through the interview at the sta-

On a clear day you can see the Wizard of Oz

tion his boss wanders in and complains that the city has incor-
rectly served a notice to clear some overgrown grass in an alley-
way near his house; Mr Denoyer says he will look into it. 
Kansas’s plains have played a big part in America’s political
history. In 1891 members of the Kansas Farmers’ Alliance suppos-
edly coined the term “populist” to describe their movement. In
the presidential election in 1892 the candidate of the People’s
Party carried ﬁve states from a standing start, on a platform of
support for farmers and abandoning the gold standard. There
was a nativist streak to its ideas: Mary Elizabeth Lease, a Kansas
populist and suﬀragette, warned about a “tide of Mongols” in-
vading America. Though the party contained strains of anti-Sem-
itism and racism, writes John Judis in “The Populist Explosion”,
these were secondary. The core of its appeal was an anti-elitism
that has been part of Midwestern politics ever since. The People’s
Party was later incorporated into the Democratic Party.
A little over a century on, Kansas populism had changed
again. In 2004 Thomas Frank lamented in “What’s the Matter
with Kansas?” that the leftish populism of Lease and her ilk had
been replaced by a rightish sort. Republicans, he argued, had
managed to bamboozle his home state, selling voters economic
policies that were not to their advantage by wrapping them up in
emotive messages about abortion and guns. Kathy Cramer puts
the question more succinctly in “The Politics of Resentment”:
why would someone without teeth not support government-
funded dental care? Her interviewees farther north, in Wiscon-
sin, provided the answer: “The government must be mishan-
dling my hard-earned dollars, because my taxes keep going up
and clearly they are not coming back to beneﬁt people like me. So
why would I want an expansion of government?”

A wetter version of Texas

Kansas’s current governor, Sam Brownback, has run with
this kind of thinking. When he took oﬃce in 2011, promising to
turn the state into a wetter version of Texas, with no state income
tax and lots of incentives for businesses to move there, the Kan-
sas Speaks survey run by Fort Hays State University showed that
voters were keen on the idea. Since then the tax cuts have failed
to produce the hoped-for economic miracle; instead, the govern-
ment has repeatedly missed its revenue targets and services have
been cut (the Republican-controlled state legislature voted to roll
back the tax cuts in early June). The Kansas Speaks poll suggests
that but for Chris Christie in New Jersey, Governor Brownback

Canada), thinks that the president should
copy the immigration law of 1924, which
handed out citizenship to newcomers in
proportion to the country’s existing racial
make-up (which in practice meant giving
preference to northern Europeans). Mr
Buckley reasons that having a boardroom
or a cabinet that reﬂects the country’s eth-
nic make-up is generally held to be a good
thing, so why not apply the same logic to
immigration quotas? Democrats resist
such thinking as racially motivated, but
they are in a bind. The long progressive
consensus that started with the New Deal
in the 1930s and lasted until the mid-1960s
coincided precisely with the most restric-
tive immigration laws in the country’s
history. There is a tension between immi-
gration and redistribution that the party
has yet to resolve. 
Republicans in Liberal argue that the
melting pot is working well there. The
bakery sells creamy quinceanera cakes; the newcomers seem to
like the annual Ozfest (past participants include Judy Garland’s
stand-in and a smattering of munchkins). Citizenship classes at
the community college are oversubscribed. 
This strain in the Republican Party is being squashed by a
White House partly staﬀed by Californians desperate to prevent
the kind of ethnic change that swept through their home state
from spreading to the rest of the country. Stephen Bannon, Mr
Trump’s chief strategist, who worked in Hollywood for a while,
once said that the defeat of a bill in Congress that would have giv-
en illegal immigrants without a criminal record a path to citizen-
ship was an achievement comparable to the passage of the Civil
Rights Act. The stop-America-from-becoming-California move-
ment is a window onto a more general truth. In addition to the di-
vides on education, and between cities and countryside, Ameri-
can politics has become polarised along ethnic lines. 7

Race and status anxiety

Colonies of the mind

It is wrong to dismiss the president’s supporters as a
band of racists, but race helps explain his appeal

IN CULLMAN, ALABAMA, the strawberry festival is in full
swing. A community band is playing a medley of Beatles
numbers interspersed with patriotic songs while people browse
the stalls or wait for a turn on the bucking bronco. On stage Sena-
tor Luther Strange, who was appointed by Alabama’s governor
when Jeﬀ Sessions became attorney-general, is reminding the
crowd that he is on the Senate’s agriculture committee, so they
might want to vote for him in the Republican primary in August.
Alabama’s voters remain very enthusiastic about Mr Trump, he
says afterwards. They “recognise he’s trying to turn the ship
around” and tend to blame Congress for any reversals.
Cullman was founded as a German colony after the civil
war and remains 96% white, according to the Census Bureau,
though there are some migrant workers in nearby poultry plants.
Woody Jacobs, Cullman’s (Republican) mayor, says there are a

would be the nation’s least popular governor. It also shows that a
majority now favour tax rises, and that most Kansans think their
own taxes went up after the state cut income tax. When voters
get what they thought they wanted, they do not always like it.
Mr Trump’s approval rating is more than twice that of Go-
vernor Brownback’s in Kansas. One reason is that he talks of
more protection for his voters but without proposing tax in-
creases. A consistent ﬁnding in the General Social Survey is that
people favour tax cuts but like increased government spending
even more. On the campaign trail, the president denied there
was a trade-oﬀ, insisting that people can have lower taxes with-
out cuts to social security (pensions) or Medicare (health care for
the elderly); and a pro-business administration that will also pre-
vent companies from moving jobs overseas. When researching a
book on Tea Party activists in 2010, Theda Skocpol of Harvard
University found that many wanted just this combination but
ended up voting for shrink-the-government conservatives.
Many of these activists already had a favourable impression of
Mr Trump, who was then telling anyone who would listen that
Barack Obama was not born in America. “The promise of social
insurance for white people plus restrictions on trade and immi-
gration is very appealing,” says Ms Skocpol. “It is not a mixture
that has been on oﬀer before.”
For all Mr Trump’s railing against NAFTA, trade provokes
less visceral feelings than immigration; a lot of voters say they do
not know whether they favour more restrictions on imports. But
there is a heartfelt nativist streak in support for Mr Trump, just as
there was when 19th-century populists were denouncing the
Mongol invasion. The share of people living in America who
were born abroad reached 15% in 1890, then declined after restric-
tions were imposed on immigration in the 1920s, to a low of 5% in
1970. Since then it has risen again, reaching 13% in 2010. Many of
the president’s supporters feel that such people are not proper
Americans; 63% of Trump voters said that to be truly American it
was either very or fairly important to have been born in the
country (42% of Clinton voters thought the same). One reason
may be that voters failed to distinguish between Hispanics and
illegal immigrants, a distinction the president has blurred.
Since assuming oﬃce, the president has continued to con-
demn illegal immigration, but also sometimes seemed to extend
a welcome to the legal sort. His White House is split on this: some
advisers would halt legal immigration too. Mr Buckley, the law
professor and speechwriter (and himself an immigrant from

lot of illegal immigrants in the region, but that most people re-
gard them as friends and co-workers. “People don’t want them to
go. But they will also say, ‘we need to secure the border and get
rid of the illegals’.” Asked how much of politics in northern Ala-
bama is about race, he replies, with the patience of a man who
has been asked this a few times before, that it really is not.
“There’s an African-American town near here called Colony,” he
says, “and I believe they voted for Trump.”
Over in Colony the voters do not seem so sure. Sitting in the
Methodist church, Earlene Johnson says quietly that there was “a
nice turnout at the town hall” on election night and that most
people in Colony in fact voted for Mrs Clinton (the voting returns
from the town hall conﬁrm this: she took 64% of the 300 ballots
cast). Outside the church is a graveyard with headstones that
date back to the late 19th century. Colony was settled in the brief
window during Reconstruction when former slaves might be
granted 40 acres and a mule, and has remained African-Ameri-
can ever since. Aside from that it would be hard to distinguish
from many other small towns in the South: people driving vast
pickups, saying “y’all” and greeting visitors from the porches of
bungalows that were towed in by truck and deposited in place.
Mrs Johnson, who remembers the nearby schools being integrat-
ed, says that the troubles between the races are largely over now.
That is true, yet people still vote along racial lines, and not
just in the South. To try to get at voters’ attitudes to people of oth-
er races, the ANES has asked a series of questions designed to
measure racial resentment (such as “do you agree that blacks
would get ahead if only they tried harder?”). Academics who
study these responses debate whether they really reﬂect racism
or whether they just pick up attitudes to subjects like welfare and
aﬃrmative action. Still, it is hard to argue that these questions
have nothing to do with race, says Mi-
chael Tesler of the University of Califor-
nia, Irvine. When Hillary Clinton ran
against Barack Obama in the 2008 Demo-
cratic primary, those who scored highly
on racial-resentment questions were
more likely to back Mrs Clinton. When
she ran against Bernie Sanders in the 2016
primary, that pattern disappeared. Re-
publican primary voters who scored
highly on racial-resentment questions
were more likely to back Mr Trump than
other candidates. To dismiss the anger
that the president taps into as racism is

cans have long denounced Democrats for pursuing identity poli-
tics, but there is no other sort. Just as cities with large African-
American populations tend to prefer African-American mayors,
Trump voters, who are overwhelmingly white, have a marked
preference for helping other white people. In 2016 the ANES
asked voters how important it was for whites to work together to
change laws that are unfair to whites. A large share of Trump vot-
ers thought this either “extremely” or “very” important (see
chart). The number for Clinton voters was lower but still consid-
erable, given what a big part anti-racism plays in the make-up of
the modern Democratic Party.
The belief of many whites that life has become unfair and
needs rebalancing in their favour is connected to feelings of fear
and of mourning for something lost, says
Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist at Berkeley
and the author of “Strangers In Their Own
Land”, a book about conservative Louisi-
ana published before the election. Ms
Hochschild has since been back to check
on some of the people she wrote about to
see what they make of the president’s pro-
gress. They are exhilarated to have a presi-
dent who “recognises” them, she says.
Most of her interviewees were the elite of
Mr Trump’s left-behind America, people
who had struggled hard to get to commu-
nity or Bible college. They were pleased
that Mr Trump took their side against
more recent arrivals in America, who
seemed to be queue-jumping. They also
liked the way he freed them from what
Ms Hochschild calls
“liberal feeling
rules”, a set of attitudes to minorities, gay
people, women and the poor that Trump
supporters found oppressive.
Race was seldom mentioned; in fact some of Mrs Hoch-
schild’s subjects said they looked forward to the day when skin
colour counted for nothing. The mourning is bound up with per-
ceptions of status that are partly about skin tone and partly
about the passing of a labour market when a man could support
a family with one stable, albeit occasionally dangerous, job. This
attitude is shared by a lot of women, Ms Hochschild found, who
liked the president’s promises to protect their husband’s jobs, or
to return America to a time when they themselves did not have
to work. Half of Trump voters believe it is “better if a man works
and a woman stays at home”, against only a quarter of Clinton
voters. That change has been understood in terms of race. “A lot

What remains when hard racism evaporates is a residue
of unconscious bias and a tendency for people to
sympathise more with those of their own racial group

“intellectual comfort food”, writes Joan Williams, the author of
“White Working Class”. Some old-fashioned racism is indeed in
evidence: when people show up with burning torches to protest
against the removal of Confederate memorials, it is hard to call it
anything else. But this kind of thing attracts attention because it is
rare. There has been a marked decline in the racist attitudes prev-
alent in places like Cullman even 20 years ago. One simple mea-
sure of progress on race, the share of people who approve of mar-
riage between whites and non-whites, rose from 48% in 1995 to
87% in 2013, according to Gallup.

of people said they saw what had happened to blacks three de-
cades ago when they took the ﬁrst hit from deindustrialisation.
Their families are a mess. And now it’s our turn,” says Ms Hoch-
schild. Being alarmed about a relative loss of status is not racist,
but views about status are conditioned by race. During the
Obama presidency, black Americans were consistently more op-
timistic about the future than whites. Since the election, eco-
nomic conﬁdence among whites has soared.

The pr ice of prosper ity

This might seems like a straightforward case of economic
hardship fuelling support for the president. Yet once again there
is more to it than that. In an essay published in 1955, “The Sources
of the Radical Right”, Seymour Martin Lipset tried to explain
why the post-war boom, now remembered as a golden era for
the economy, also gave rise to paranoid political movements
such as the John Birch Society and to McCarthyism. He thought
that when the economy was growing or stable, some groups of
Americans developed “status anxiety” about being eclipsed by
others. “In the United States, political movements or parties
which stress the need for economic reform have usually gained
strength during times of unemployment and depression,” he
wrote. “On the other hand, status politics becomes ascendant in
periods of prosperity.” 
According to Lipset, “the political consequences of status
frustrations are very diﬀerent from those resulting from eco-
nomic deprivation, for while in economic conﬂict the goals are
clear—a redistribution of income—in status conﬂict there are no
clear-cut solutions. Where there are status anxieties, there is little
or nothing a government can do.” Political movements that have
successfully appealed to status resentments, in Lipset’s view,
tend to seek convenient scapegoats. “Historically, the most com-
mon scapegoats in the United States have been the minority eth-
nic or religious groups.” The results from the ANES, which
showed that half of Trump voters thought Barack Obama was a
Muslim, seem to conﬁrm Lipset’s ﬁndings.
One of the puzzles of current American politics is why Mr
Trump’s brand of right-wing populism ﬂourished at a point
when the ﬁnancial crisis was over, the country was nearing full
employment and the S&P 500 was setting new records. If Lipset
was right, the widespread view that the Trump presidency is the
result of economic distress, and that the underlying attitudes can
be assuaged with the right policies, may be misleading. 
Like most voters, the president’s supporters do not really
know what they want from him. They do, however, have a
strong sense that he takes their side against those groups of
Americans who are against them. That gives Mr Trump a lot of
leeway on what he can do without losing their support. 7

Trump in government

White House windows

The president’s actions are hard to understand,
leaving voters even more reliant on partisan thinking

ON ONE WALL of Stephen Bannon’s oﬃce in the West
Wing of the White House is a large whiteboard with a list of
promises the president made on the campaign trail. Most of
them ﬁt the nationalist, nativist, populist programme that Mr
Bannon has done more than anyone apart from the president
himself to shape, but perhaps not all: one commitment is to build
a safe zone for Syrian refugees. The president’s chief strategist is a
revolutionary in a Ferragamo tie, an alumnus of Georgetown,
Harvard and Goldman Sachs who rails against the establish-
ment. He talks about building an alliance of working people that
will hold power for 50 years.
As a political strategist, Mr Bannon follows a template he
perfected at Breitbart, the provocative website he used to run.
The Breitbart strategy is to take an extreme position and hope
that readers or voters will follow three-quarters of the way there.
At Breitbart, for example, illegal migrants are not just people who
broke immigration laws, but potential rapists and drug-dealers.
Political scientists refer to the range of ideas the public might be
willing to accept at any one time as the Overton window, after Jo-
seph Overton, who codiﬁed the concept. Mr Bannon specialises
in moving that window. Given that most voters do not follow
politics closely, rarely switch parties and are often willing to align
their preferences to those of the party or candidate they favour,
Mr Bannon and the rest of the Trump White House have consid-
erable freedom to place the window where it suits them.
The president’s approval ratings may gradually slip to the
mid-30s, as happened to George W. Bush in his second term. Per-
haps some of the Midwestern voters who backed Mr Trump in
the hope that he would bring back manufacturing jobs will be
disappointed. His opponents will be energised at future elec-
tions, and in a country where opinions are split roughly down
the middle, these marginal voters assume great importance. But
it remains unlikely that his supporters will desert Mr Trump en
masse. Incumbent presidents tend to do well in elections when
the economy is growing robustly. Those questioning whether Mr
Trump will be forced from oﬃce should remember this.
The president’s admirers describe him as “situational”, by
which they mean he has no ideology to speak of and judges each
decision that comes before him in isolation. That explains, they
say, how he can denounce President Obama for bombing Libya
to prevent its government from killing its citizens, then launch a
cruise-missile strike against the Syrian government to do the

2 same thing. The president often seems to be pursuing the Breit-
bart strategy, only then to head in the opposite direction. On
April 12th he cancelled a federal hiring freeze he had ordered in
his ﬁrst week in oﬃce; decided against labelling China as a cur-
rency manipulator; endorsed the Export-Import Bank, which
provides ﬁnance to big companies like Boeing; and declared
NATO relevant after all, breaking three campaign promises and
abandoning one favourite theme in a single day. A little over a
month later he changed direction again, declining to endorse ex-
plicitly NATO’s article 5, which says that an attack on one mem-
ber is an attack on all, and pulling out of the Paris agreement on
climate change. There is no consistent thread running through
what he does; he can change his mind at any moment.
One of the president’s informal advisers says he cares more
about getting something that looks like a win than about pursu-
ing any particular policy. That would explain why he sometimes
seems unaware of the details of policies he has advocated. When
his administration on its 100th day in oﬃce got close to pulling
out of NAFTA, it came as news to the president that some of his
voters beneﬁted from membership of the trade block.

A permanent ﬁt of absent-mindedness

Much of the scandal that has roiled the Trump administra-
tion could be explained this way. The decision to hire Michael
Flynn as national security adviser, which has been the cause of
so many of the president’s troubles, was taken without seriously
considering advice from the outgoing administration that pick-
ing someone for that role who was under federal investigation
for working for other countries might be a bad idea. Likewise, the
sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI, which some have
seen as part of a well-thought-out plot, could equally suggest an
absence of planning. The president may have been unaware that
ﬁring the FBI director after he declined to halt the investigation of
Mr Flynn was an unusual move and would raise suspicions of a
cover-up. This is no defence: the presidency is not a round of golf,
where lousy players get a generous handicap to even things up.
But Mr Trump probably does not realise that he is trampling on
America’s political norms, changing the way the country is gov-
erned through profound absent-mindedness.
To his backers, the continuing involvement of his children
in Trump companies, far from being evidence of corruption, is a
reminder of all that he has sacriﬁced to be president. They see the
travel ban the president tried to impose on visitors from six Mus-
lim-majority countries, which is still stuck in the courts, not as an
attempt to enact the Muslim ban that he had promised on the
trail, but as a reasonable eﬀort to reconcile America’s traditions
of non-discrimination with the president’s responsibility to pro-

tect its citizens. The never-end-
ing stories about Russia, which
tend to be misunderstood as an
accusation that Vladimir Putin
decisively inﬂuenced the result
of the presidential election, are
dismissed as inventions by liber-
als to explain Hillary Clinton’s
failure. Given how few Clinton
voters the average Trump voter
knows, that explanation can
seem plausible to them.
How are voters likely to re-
spond to this way of governing?
Not by ﬁltering out the noise
from the latest outrage, then
calmly taking
each policy
change and feeding it into a
mental equation that
recali-
brates their level of approval for
the president. Instead, to the ex-
tent that most people are think-
ing about politics at all, they are
making
judgments
about
whether the president is trying
to do the right thing or is funda-
mentally malign. Such judg-
ments are shaped by geography,
education and skin colour, and
are subject to groupthink: in
mid-May 80% of Trump voters
told YouGov that they see criti-
cism of Mr Trump as an attack on “people like me”.
Those who watch or listen to the news have their view of
the president’s good intentions conﬁrmed when they ﬁnd their
place in their partisan trench reinforced by attacks on their oppo-
nents. Some of the most prominent conservative broadcasters—
Rush Limbaugh on talk radio, Tucker Carlson on Fox News—do
not support everything the president does so much as show alle-
giance to the tribe by denouncing those who denounce him.
One of Mr Limbaugh’s favourite themes is the similarity be-
tween American liberalism and sharia law. Even for someone
who is unsure which party is the more conservative, a choice be-
tween a perhaps ﬂawed but well-meaning president on one side
and fundamentalists on the other does not take much reﬂection.
This gives the president a remarkable amount of latitude
with his supporters. During the campaign Mr Trump oﬀered to
pay the legal costs if someone beat up a protester at one of his ral-
lies. The ANES asked voters whether protesters who got roughed
up for disrupting political events generally deserved what hap-
pened to them. Some 30% of Trump voters said protesters de-
served it “a lot” or “a great deal”; only 18% replied “not at all”. As
long as it is the other side that suﬀers, a degree of violence is ac-
ceptable, even welcome.
It is extraordinary that such a prosperous, peaceful, fortu-
nate country, with such deep democratic traditions, could have
arrived at this point, but it has. “So strong is this propensity of
mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substan-
tial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful dis-
tractions have been suﬃcient to kindle their unfriendly passions
and excite their most violent conﬂicts,” wrote James Madison in
Federalist Paper No 10. The Trump presidency could yet go in sev-
eral directions. The one that seems deﬁnitely blocked is the route
back to a land where it is rare to think that political opponents de-
serve to be beaten up. Perhaps that country no longer exists. 7

The air-conditioned contain-er-unithouses, home to 24,000 displacedSyriansand Iraqis, are spotless. Each unitcomeswith a kitchen, a bedroom, a televi-sion and a laundrymachine. The campalso boastsa school, a hospital and a su-permarket. “We have all thatwe need,”saysMuhammad Darwish, cradlinghisbabyniece, Hiyam, one ofover240,000refugee children born on Turkish soil since2011. Turkey’spresident, Recep Tayyip Er-dogan, surveysthe scene from a huge ban-nernearthe camp’sentrance, hisimagenextto thatofa distraughtchild. “Itisamatterofconscience,” readsthe caption. To the people ofthe surroundingvil-lages, itisalso a matterofcontroversy. Thecamp’sresidentsare all Sunnis. The villagelocalsare Alevis, membersofTurkey’sbig-gestreligiousminorityand distantcousinsofthe Alawites, the sectthatformsthebackbone ofthe Syrian regime. Fearingsectarian tensionsand the lossofgrazingland fortheirlivestock, the villagers prot-ested againstthe camp’sconstruction lastyear. Police doused them with teargas. Tomake amends, the municipalitygave eachhousehold a cow. Butthe mistrustendures. In Lower Tero-lar, a village down the road from the camp,farmerssaytheyavoid goingoutafter darklasted fordaysaftera Turkish man whotried to stop a group ofSyrian and Afghanmen from harassinglocal girlswasstabbedand killed. “Whenevera Syrian and a Turkgetinto a ﬁght, entire neighbourhoods tendto jump in,” saysSelcukDelibas, a human-rightsactivist. In Kahramanmaras, the riskiscompounded byold traumas. Villagersoften recall a riotin 1978 in the provincialcapital in which more than 100 Aleviswerekilled bymobsofnationalistsand Islam-ists. Some are convinced thatthe refugeecamp housesradical Syrian insurgents.“The villagersthinkthe refugeesare jiha-dists, and the refugeesthinkthe villagersare Assad supporters,” saysMrDelibas.Don’tmake yourselves athomeSome see these problemsasthe result ofaﬂawed policy. While Turkeyhasmetthenewcomers’ basicneeds, ithasmade feweﬀortsto integrate them. Instead ofoﬀer-ingSyriansfull refugee status, ithas grant-ed them “temporaryprotection”, whichimpliesfewerrights. The labourmarket re-mainslargelyoﬀ-limits. Atthe start oflastyearTurkeyallowed Syriansto applyforworkpermits. To date, ithasissued fewerthan 20,000, correspondingto perhaps1%ofthe working-age refugee population.About500,000 othershave entered Tur-key’sshadoweconomy, where theyareroutinelyexploited. Education isan equal-lybigproblem. Ofthe 900,000 school-ageSyrian children, lessthan 60% are enrolled.Just18% attend normal schools, asopposedto temporarylearningcentreslike the onesin the camps. One reason whyMrErdogan’sgovern-menthasyetto acknowledge that, after sixyearsofwar, the Syriansare in Turkey tostay, isthe riskofa domesticbacklash. An-otheristhe fearthatcallsto integrate themare a ploy. “The governmentseesthisas a and give the refugeesa wide berth.“They’re a verydiﬀerentpeople,” saysanelderlyman. “We should nothave to beneighbours.” The camp residentsareequallyanxious. “I would notgo there onmyown,” saysAmmar, a 25-year-old fromAleppo. “They’re Alevis. They’re notthesame onesasin Syria, butthey’re Alevis.”Compared with othercountries, Turkeyhasdone an excellentjob oflookingafterthe 3m refugeeswho have poured in sincethe startofSyria’scivil warin 2011. MrErdo-gan’sIslamistgovernmentsaysithas spent$25bn managingthe two dozen campsnearthe Syrian border, home to 250,000people, and providingaid to refugees out-side ofcamps, in otherpartsofthe country.Thatcost, and the strain on publicservices(Syriansin Turkeyreceive free health care),will probablykeep rising. The refugee pop-ulation isgrowingmuch fasterthan Tur-key’s. Atthe Kahramanmarascamp, itis setto double in under10 years. MostTurks’ solidaritywith the new-comersremainsstrong. AcrossEurope,anti-immigrantpartieshave jumped at thechance to turn fearofrefugeesinto votes.In Turkey, neitherthe nationalistnor thesecularopposition hasattempted to do so. Yetthere are signsoftrouble ahead.Opinion pollsshowattitudestowardsref-ugeeshardening. Reportsofcrime involv-ingrefugees, some ofthem bogus, haveprovoked clashes.

The billion-aire, who holdsno oﬃcial postbutpullsstringsfrom behind the scenes, ischangingnotonlyitsphysical butitspolitical land-scape. He hasalso uprooted the largest ﬁg-ure in Georgian publiclife, formerpresi-dentMikheil Saakashvili.Aftertakingpowerin a popularupris-ingin 2003, MrSaakashvili forcefullymo-dernised Georgia, broke with itsSoviet leg-acyand builtan eﬀective state. In 2010 hisUnited National Movement(UNM) lostanelection to the Georgian Dream party, analliance puttogetherbyMrIvanishvili,whose accumulated wealth (mostlymadein Russia) washalfaslarge asGeorgia’san-nual GDP. MrSaakashvili wasforced outofthe country; some ofhisassociates wereputin jail. Yetthe main reason the UNMlostpowerwasnotitsreformsoranti-cor-ruption eﬀorts, butfearofitsrepressive useofthe judiciaryforpolitical ends. In some waysGeorgia todayisfreerthan underMrSaakashvili. The number ofcourtacquittalshasrisen, and the fear ofpersecution isgone. ButGeorgia hasalsolostitssense ofmission, saysGia Khuk-hashvili, a political consultantonce closeto MrIvanishvili.

Once a model ofmodernisation and one ofthe rare post-So-vietcountriesto have been successful atgraft-busting, itnowexempliﬁesthe diﬃ-cultyoftransition. CriticssayMrIvanish-vili treatsitashisplayground. Oligarchs inotherpost-Sovietcountriesare envious. To be sure, the changesbroughtin bythe Rose Revolution in 2003 have notbeenfullyreversed. Corruption hasnotre-turned; Georgia ratesbetterthan Italy andclose to Spain on TransparencyInterna-tional’scorruption perceptionsindex. Ithasa strongcivil society. Indeed, many ofMrSaakashvili’sformerallies, includingGiga Bokeria, the brain behind the coun-try’sreforms, thinkthe countryhasout-grown itsformerleader. Theysayitwas thefearofMrSaakashvili regainingpowerthatcostthe UNMlastyear’sparliamenta-ryelections. (Theyare also angryat him forendorsingriotsin Batumi in March.)

YetWesternleadersare relieved. Serbia isthe mostpowerful countryin the western Balkans,and MrVucic, whateverhisﬂaws, cankeep itstable. Variationson thisdeal canbe seen acrossthe region. Some are call-ingsuch governments“stabilitocracies”. MrVucic’smain opponentin thepresidential race wasVukJeremic, aformerforeign minister. The campaignwasﬁlthy. Media sympatheticto MrVucicmade outlandish allegations: MrJeremicwaspurportedlya secretMuslimsupported byIslamicState who had beencomplicitin a high-proﬁle murder; hiswife supposedlyheaded a drugscartel.The police abruptlyquestioned him overalleged ﬁnancial improprieties. No char-geswere ﬁled, and MrJeremicsays thestorieswere all ﬁction. Whathappened to MrJeremicshocked no one. Accordingto Srdja Pav-lovic, the Montenegrin academicwhocoined the term “stabilitocracy”, Westerncountriesignore local autocrats’ anti-democraticpracticesso longasthey keepthe peace. Bosnia, forexample, remainsdysfunctional more than two decadesafteritswarended, divided byethnic-based parties. America and Europe toler-ate this, provided the country’sleadersensure theircrisesneverturn violent. Stabilitocracyworksdiﬀerentlyde-pendingon the country. In Montenegro, itisclearwho runsthe show: since 1989 ithasbeen Milo Djukanovic, who hasthrice taken time oﬀfrom servingaspresidentorprime ministeronlyto re-turn afterrunningthingsfrom behind thescenes.

Aseverywhere in the re-gion, votesare boughtbyhandingoutgovernmentjobs.Usuallyin Balkan countries, electionslead to coalition negotiationsthat focuson howto divide the spoils.

On May31stthe Social Demo-crats, alongwith ethnicAlbanian parties,tookpower. Butthe newgovernmentwill reproduce the same cronyism unlessit“breaksthe pattern ofpartycontrol ofthe state”, saysFlorian Bieber, a politicalscientistatGrazUniversity. Thatis a tallorderin a region where the state, wheth-erundercommunism ornow, hasneverbeen independentofparties. “Citizensare alienated from politicsand vote forpersonal, tangible beneﬁtsoroutoffear,” saysa reporton stabilitoc-racybythe Balkansin Europe PolicyAdvisoryGroup, an academicround-table.

With itssupportdeclining, GeorgianDream hasbeen tryingto change the con-stitution. Ithasproposed banningpartiesfrom formingelectoral alliances(despitecomingto powerin an alliance seven yearsago), imposinga 5% threshold to enterpar-liament, and givingall unallocated votesto whicheverpartycomesﬁrst. Given thefragmented political landscape, thiscouldgive Georgian Dream another20-30% ofthe seats.On June 19th the Council ofEurope’sVenice Commission ruled thatthiscombi-nation ofchangeswould “lead to a seriousinfringementofthe principle ofequality”.Afewdayslater, an emergencysession ofparliamentapproved a slightlyamendedversion ofthe constitution thatignores theprotestsofthe president, otherpoliticalpartiesand civicactivists. Georgian Dreamalso postponed until 2024 a planned shiftfrom the currentelectoral system, whosecombination ofmajoritarian and propor-tional votingbeneﬁtsthe government, to afullyproportional one, and barred the saleofagricultural land to foreigners.Meanwhile, publiclife isstarting to feellessfree. An independentAzerbaijani jour-nalistlivingin Georgia waskidnapped inTbilisi in Mayand passed on to Azerbaijaniauthorities. An attemptbyMrIvanishvili’salliesto take control overRustavi-2, an op-position television channel, wasstoppedonlybya decision ofthe European CourtofHuman Rights.

Angela Merkel wastakingquestionsfrom the readersofBrigitte, a life-style magazine. Ayoungman asked her:“When can I getto call myboyfriend myhusband?” The chancellor, who had previ-ouslydescribed marriage asthe union ofaman and a woman, gave a typicallycrypticanswer. She noted the “diﬃculties” that“some” have with same-sexmarriage anddescribed beingaﬀected bya meeting withalesbian couple in herconstituency. Thencame the crucial phrase. HerChristianDemocrat(CDU)party, ventured MrsMer-kel tentatively, should shift“somewhatinthe direction ofa question ofconscience”.Then thingsmoved fast. The nextdayherSocial Democrat(SPD) coalition part-nerspicked up on the comment, brokewith the CDUand called a parliamentaryvote on gaymarriage with the socialist Leftpartyand the Greens. The dayafter, thechancellorgave itherblessing. AsThe Econ-omistwentto pressthe vote wasdue onJune 30th, and wasexpected to passwiththe backingofthe three left-of-centre par-tiesand a handful ofCDUMPs.

Whatmoved MrsMerkel’sposition?The chancelloriscoastingtowardswin-ninga fourth term atGermany’selection inSeptember; on June 28th, the pollstersatForsa putsupportforherCDU(and itsBa-varian partner, the CSU) at40% forthe ﬁrsttime in almosttwo years. She hardlyneedsto take gambles. Butto understand hershift, one mustgrasp the three main rulesofherleadership style.The ﬁrstisnotto outrun public opinion.Even MrsMerkel’sriskiestpolicies—her de-cisionsto switch oﬀGermany’snuclearpowerstationsin 2011and to letin refugeesin 2015—responded to changesin public at-titudes. Likewise, the chancellorﬁrmlyruled outgaymarriage when mostGer-manswere opposed, butthe latestYouGovpoll putssupportforitat66% (and forgayadoption at57%). Herchange ofmind re-alignsherwith the publicmood.Second: be strategicallyinoﬀensive.MrsMerkel winselectionsnotjustby mak-ingpeople like her, butalso byreducing thenumberofpeople who dislike her. Shemakesherselfso tolerable to supporters ofotherpartiesthattheystayathome onelection day. Atthe SPD’spre-election con-ference in Dortmund on June 25th, a frus-trated Martin Schulz, herrival forthe chan-cellorship, lambasted thistechnique of“asymmetricdemobilisation” asan attackon democracy. MrsMerkel’snewpositionon marriage, notstarkenough to force ei-thersupportersordetractorsto the polls,exempliﬁeshiscomplaint.Thispointsto the third rule: triangulatedeftly, and rapidlywhen eventsdemand it.In recentweeksthe Greensand the liberalFree Democratsconﬁrmed thattheywould join no post-election coalition op-posed to same-sexmarriage. Then in Dort-mund MrSchulzmade itan SPDred line.The issue threatened to overshadowMrsMerkel’smanifesto launch on July3rd andsplitthe CDU’sliberal wingfrom itsconser-vatives(includingthose tempted bytheright-wingAlternative forGermanyparty).So she tested outthe “question ofcon-science” line within partycirclesand wasreadyto use itwhen the question was putatthe Brigitteevent. Contained within these rulesare thecasesforand againstMrsMerkel. To herfansshe isan exemplarydemocrat, con-stantlycalibratingand recalibrating ac-cordingto the will ofthe people. To hercrit-icsshe merelyfollowspublicopinion andistoo hyper-cautiousto shape it. Mrs Mer-kel’sshifton gaymarriage isa welcome il-lustration ofherstrengths.

Huge numbersofthem wentto the pollsin the election onJune 8th, often forthe ﬁrsttime, and theyvoted overwhelminglyforLabour. Butal-though the personal devotion thatMrCor-byn inspiresamongtented grime fanshasgiven the partya bigboost, Labourre-mainsdivided on howitmightcapturepower. Asseveral LabourMPswere quickto pointout, forall the hoopla around MrCorbyn’ssurge in the polls, he still lost. ForCorbynistas, itisa matterof “onelastpush” to getinto DowningStreet, toquote the wordsofEmilyThornberry, theshadowforeign secretary, ata meeting ofthe centristLabourPartygroup Progress onJune 24th. With a weakened Conservativegovernment, manyexpectanothergeneralelection soon.

The pro-blem isthatmostofthe seatsthatLabourneedsto win are in the north and the Mid-lands, with older, more working-class con-stituents. “WhatgotLabourhere won’tgetthem there,” concludesMrRoberts. Andthe Toriesmayup theirgame. TheresaMay’scampaign wasdire; a bettercandi-date, takingMrCorbyn more seriously,could fare better.Therefore, argue MPssuch asRuth Cad-bury, MrCorbyn should exploitthebreadth ofthe party’straditionsto winmore votes. “The job ofleadingismorethan speakingto crowdsofadmirers, and itisvitallyimportantthatthe leadershipholdsthisgovernmentto account,” shesays. MsCadburyincreased hermajorityfrom 465 to over12,000 in herwestLondonseatofBrentford and Isleworth. She sayssome ofthismayhave been attributable toCorbynmania, butitwasalso due to herstance asa ferventRemainer. Yetthat willnothelp Labourin manyofthe northern,working-classseatsthatitstill has to win.Indeed, itison the subjectofBrexit thatMrCorbyn’scoalition mayunravel. La-bourMPsand activistsagree thatmany ofthe youngwho voted forthe partyon June8th were motivated bytheirrejection ofshould double down on whathasserved itso well in the pastcouple ofmonths, rely-ingon youngvotersand takingaim at aus-terity.

MrsMay, anotherwhovoted Remain, hasmade herchoice; thekingofwoke hasyetto make his. 7FORmanyBrexiteers, the issue attheheartofthe case forleavingthe Euro-pean Union wassovereignty. Membershipofthe EU wasincompatible with self-de-termination, theyargued. Britain isone ofthe world’sgreatmilitaryand economicpowers; itwould do justﬁne on itsown.Remainersresponded thatin a globalisedworld, sovereigntyispooled. AsDavidCameron, Britain’sill-fated prime minister,putit, Brexitheld outthe “illusion” ofsovereignty: Britain would gain indepen-dence atthe costofreal power.On June 22nd, in an earlytestofthesearguments, the UN weighed in on a dis-pute between Britain and Mauritiusoverthe Chagosislands, a tinybutstrategicallyimportantarchipelago in the Indian Ocean(see map). Ninety-fourcountriessidedwith Mauritius; just15 backed Britain. Theresult, saysJagdish Koonjul, Mauritius’srepresentative to the UN, was“beyond myexpectation”. OnlyfourmembersoftheEU voted with Britain; one, Cyprus, votedwith Mauritiusand 22 abstained, includ-ingusuallyreliable alliesFrance, Germany,Italy, the Netherlandsand Spain. “Itwasacomplete haemorrhagingofsupportforBritain,” saysPhilippe Sands, a lawyer rep-resentingMauritius. “Thisshould be a realwake-up call.”The rootsofthe dispute go backto 1965,when Britain lopped oﬀthe Chagosis-landsfrom Mauritius, atthe time a Britishcolony. Itloaned the largestisland, DiegoGarcia, to America to use asa militarybase. Since then the atoll, which iswithinstrikingdistance ofeastAfrica, the MiddleEastand South-EastAsia, hasbecome in-dispensable forAmerica’sarmed forces,who nickname it“the footprintoffree-dom”. Itgivesthem control overthe IndianOcean and hasserved asa base forlong-range bombersto pummel Afghanistanand Iraq. The CIA used itasa “blacksite” initsrendition programme.ButtakingoverDiego Garcia formili-taryuse meantdeportingsome 1,500 Cha-gossians, mostlyto Mauritiusand the Sey-chelles. Theyhave neverbeen allowed toreturn; manymoved to Britain. (After land-ingatGatwickairport, theywere giventemporaryaccommodation nearbyinCrawley, where mostofthem still live.)Mauritiusclaimsthe islandsare part ofitsterritoryand wantsthe dispute referredto the International CourtofJustice (ICJ).Britain argued thatitshould be resolved bi-laterally. America tookitsside. But with itsState Departmentunderstaﬀed and itspresidentwidelydistrusted, itslobbyingeﬀortfailed. Britain’sdiplomacywasnobetter; the name ofBorisJohnson, the for-eign secretary, “raised an eyebroworalaugh each time itwasmentioned”, accord-ingto one person present. In an inauspi-cioussign for“Empire 2.0”, the nicknameBritish oﬃcialsuse fortheirplan to forgecloserlinkswith the Commonwealth, thevastmajorityofBritain’sformercoloniesbacked Mauritiusorabstained.The importance ofthe vote should notbe exaggerated. Itrefersthe case to the ICJ,whose opinion will be non-binding. Formanycountries, the vote wasa chance totake a digatAmerica and to reiterate theirsupportfordecolonisation. In future voteson more central issuesofnational security,Britain maystill be able to relyon strongsupportfrom the EU.Still, “Itisa little cheep from the canaryin the coal mine,” saysRichard Whitman,directorofthe Global Europe Centre at theUniversityofKent. Otherfar-ﬂungBritishterritories, such asthe Falkland islands,mightface newchallengesfrom rivalclaimants. “Ifyou’re an Argentinian dip-lomat, youmaystartrecomputinghowmuch international supportBritain has,”saysMrWhitman.The ICJ will probablyoﬀeran advisoryopinion on the matter, butnotbefore thespringof2019. Bythen Britain isdue tohave leftthe EU. And Mauritiusmayevenhave a more sympatheticnegotiatingpartner. JeremyCorbyn, Labour’sleader,is—perhapsinevitably—a longtime advo-cate forthe rightsofthe Chagossians. 7Britain and Diego GarciaTropical stormAn isolated island battles to hang on to its outpostin the Indian OceanHot waterDiego GarciaINDIANOCEANSEYCHELLESAUSTRALIAINDONESIAACHINAINDIAAFGHAN-ISTANIRAQMAURITIUS2,500 km48BritainThe EconomistJuly1st2017WRITINGto hiswife in May1942, Evelyn Waugh recounted atrue storyofmilitaryderring-do. ABritish commando unitoﬀered to blowup an old tree-stump on Lord Glasgow’sestate,promisinghim thattheycould dynamite the tree so thatit “fallson a sixpence”. Aftera boozylunch theyall wentdown to wit-nessthe explosion. Butinstead offallingon a sixpence the tree-stump rose 50 feetin the air, takingwith ithalfan acre ofsoil andabeloved plantation ofyoungtrees. Atearful Lord Glasgow ﬂedto hiscastle onlyto discoverthateverypane ofglass had beenshattered. He then ran to hislavatoryto hide hisemotions, butwhen he pulled the plugoutofhiswashbasin “the entire ceiling,loosened bythe explosion, fell on hishead.”Ayearon from the Brexitreferendum Britain feelslike LordGlasgow’scastle. The mostvisible damage hasbeen done to itsdomesticpolitics. With the Conservative Partyin turmoil JeremyCorbyn, Labour’shard-leftleader, talksaboutbeingprime minis-terin sixmonths. Butjustasseriousisthe blowto Britain’sglobalstanding, which islowerthan ithasbeen atanytime since theSuezcrisisin 1956, when America crushed AnthonyEden’sat-temptto reassertBritish powerin Egypt.FordecadesBritain’sforeign policyhasrested on three pillars:the United States, the European Union and the emergingworld.Winston Churchill, the son ofa British aristocratand an Ameri-can heiress, coined the phrase “special relationship” to describethe tiesofblood and language thatbind Britain to America. Asaformerimperial power, Britain had close tieswith dozens ofAfri-can and Asian countries. With one ofEurope’slargesteconomies,ithad a bigsayin Europe’sfuture, often actingasa counter-bal-ance to the Franco-German axis.British diplomatscan be starry-eyed aboutthis. The Suez crisisdemonstrated thatAmerica washappyto dump the “special rela-tionship” wheneveritclashed with itsnational interest. The Brit-ish have alwaysbeen second-division playersin Europe. Yetthethree pillarshave notonlystood the testoftime. They have alsoreinforced each other. Britain’smembership ofthe EU bolstereditsinﬂuence in America justasitsclose relationswith America in-creased itscloutin the EU. The EUmagniﬁed Britain’sglobal pow-er, bringingwith ittrade dealswith 53 othercountries. Britain’sdecision to leave will obviouslydiminish its inﬂu-ence in Europe. Even ifitcan negotiate favourable access to thesingle marketitwill no longerbe partofthe EU’sdecision-makingapparatus. Itsweaknesshasalreadybeen exposed: David Davis,Britain’schiefBrexitnegotiator, hasso fardone little butmakeconcessions. So hasitsisolation. Theresa Mayisnowroutinelyasked to leave meetingswhen EU businessisdiscussed.Britain isleavingthe EU ata time when itsrelationswith theUnited Statesare perilous. Donald Trump isa volatile ﬁgurewhose lodestaris“America ﬁrst”. He isextraordinarilydivisive,meaningthatthe closerBritain getsto MrTrump the more italien-atesanti-Trumpists. Asurveyof37 countriesbythe PewResearchCentrefound thatjust22% ofpeople thoughtthatMrTrumpwould “do the rightthing” in international aﬀairs. BarackObamascored 64% in the ﬁnal yearofhispresidency.Whatofthe third pillar? The Brexiteers’ strongestcard isthattheyare globalists. Untethered from Europe’srottingcorpse, theyargue, Britain will be free to engage with the emerging world. Yetthere isno evidence thatBritish companieswere held back fromthisbyEU membership. The EUhasn’tprevented Germany’sMittelstand companiesfrom becomingglobal powerhouses. Thereverse mightbe the case: emergingcountriesare interestedabove all in accessto the EU’smarketof500m people.The self-reinforcinglogicofthe old system will go into reverseoverthe nextfewyears, whoeversitsin DowningStreet. HenryKissingertold a conference in London thisweekthatBrexit pro-videsa chance to renewthe transatlanticrelationship. Buthe wasforgettingthe question he supposedlyasked when he ran Ameri-can foreign policy: “Who do I call ifI wantto speakto Europe?”America will spend more time on the phone with a convivialpowerinside the EU than outside (MrTrump isto visitFrance onBastille Day, whereashisproposed trip to Britain isup in the air).Emergingmarketswill be more interested in dealingwith greatpowerblocksthan with a small countrywith idiosyncratic rulesand volatile politics. Thiscould happen even fasterif BritainelectsJeremyCorbyn, who hasmade a specialityofcriticising theworld’sleadingpowerswhile cuddlingup to itsbasketcases.From virtuous to vicious circleSince the 1980sBritain and America have been the world’slead-ingapostlesofthe ideologyofthe moment, neoliberalism. Britishconsultantstravelled around Europe and the formerSoviet Un-ion oﬀeringlessonson privatisation. The Swedesintroduced in-ternal marketsinto theirwelfare state. The Germanstried toadopt“shareholdercapitalism”. Butneoliberalism tooka beatingwith the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. Britain and America have sincebeen humbled bya populisttide thatproduced Brexiton one sideofthe Atlanticand MrTrump on the other. Brexiteersargued thataLeave vote would produce a “Brexitspring” asthe ancien régimetottered and the euro plunged. Instead, the EU isin itsbestshapein years, with a youngreformerinstalled in the Élysée Palace andthe Franco-German axissolid. Acrossthe continentthe presstalksofBritain asthe “sickman ofEurope”.In the aftermath ofthe Suezcrisis, Dean Acheson lamentedthatBritain had lostan empire and failed to ﬁnd a role. In the sub-sequentdecades, post-imperial Britain in factfound several roles:asa fulcrum between Europe and America; asan old hand atglo-balisation in a re-globalisingworld; and asa leadingexponent ofneoliberalism. Thanksto the combination ofthe ﬁnancial crisisand Brexit, ithaslostall ofthese functionsin one greatrush. Thewindowshave shattered and the ceilinghasfallen in. 7Decline and fallBritain has notcutsuch a patheticﬁgure on the global stage since SuezBagehot49The Economist July1st2017Property50The EconomistJuly1st20171DRIVINGthrough the Liberian country-side, on a rare paved highway, twokindsofroadside sign catch the eye.

Itisalso the kind ofneedythatenticesaidagenciesand charities. Because itis soNattyDavis, a formercabinetminister, re-members“an extreme amountofgood-will”. Asa share ofLiberia’spunyecon-omy(which issmallerthan thatofthe IsleofWight, oﬀEngland’ssouth coast) foreignaid remainsenormous.

Theyknowthatcountrieswithoutclean, eﬀective gov-ernmentsseldom escape poverty. Mightaid actuallymake itharderto govern apoorcountry, even when (indeed, espe-ciallywhen) thatcountryisa democracy? Itisquite likelythatwithoutforeign as-sistance, especiallythe blue-helmeted UNtroops, Liberia would have slid backintowar. Ifaid hasprevented such a calamity, itwould have been worthwhile. Butthatisunknowable. All thatisknown ishowthingshave turned out. And whathashap-pened in Liberia isthataid hasquietlyweakened the state even asithasbuiltroads, schoolsand othergood things. Thathashappened in two ways. First,aid hascorroded Liberia from the top, bydistractingministersand distortingthegovernment’splans. Second, ithasseepedinto the crackbetween governmentandpeople, encouragingcitizensto wonderwhattheirleadersare for. Runninga coun-small, with onlyabout4m inhabitants, do-norscan make a visible diﬀerence. Andsince 2006 Liberia hasbeen run byEllenJohnson Sirleaf.

Around the time thatLiberia’schild sol-dierswere puttingdown theirguns, West-ern governmentsand aid agencieswere re-solvingto give more wisely. Duringthecold war, aid had been a tool offoreignpolicy. There wasscarcelya governmenttoo brutal orcorruptto receive it, so longasitwason the rightside in the battle againstcommunism. Much aid was“tied”, requir-inggoodsto be boughtfrom Western com-panies. Ifitturned outto help the inhabit-antsofthe world’spoorestcountries, thatwasan incidental beneﬁt. Promises, promisesAta seriesofmeetings, includingone inParisin 2005, the Westresolved to do bet-ter. Aid would be untied. Ratherthancharginginto poorcountriesand ﬂingingmoneyatthe causestheydeemed worthy,donorswould respectplanscreated bythose countries’ politicians. Where possi-ble, aid would ﬂowthrough poor-countrybureaucracies, notaround them. Whendonorsfunnel moneyto theirown pro-grammes, and assessthose programmesthemselves, a parallel state can emerge torival the main one. Donorswould stickaround longer, too: fewersudden surges ofaid followed byabruptdrawdowns,which wrecklong-term plans. Liberia’snewgovernmenthad someideasofitsown aboutaid. The inﬂow afterthe warhad been messyand ineﬃcient.Fuel forgeneratorshad been provided, butno generators; bookshad been donatedbut, because librarieshad no shelves, theywere heaped on the ground. MsSirleafbroughtin ministersand adviserswith ex-perience ofaid, who setoutto build a bet-tersystem. Ambitiously, given Liberia’sdeep neediness, theyresolved thatthe gov-ernmentwould assertcontrol overdevel-opmentand notbe tugged oﬀcourse bydonors. “The typical attitude is: we needthe donormoney; here’swhatthe donorswantto do; we’d betternotupsetthem,” ex-plainsSteve Radelet, one ofthose advisers,who isnowatGeorgetown University. Liberia would be a test. Could the gov-ernmentofa poorcountrytake charge ofaid, asboth sidesclaimed theywanted?Mightitsucceed in usingthataid to speedoutofpoverty? Chile and Indonesia hadjump-started growth byallowingAmeri-can-educated economists, known respec-tivelyasthe Chicago Boysand the BerkeleyMaﬁa, to steerpolicy. Liberia also had animpressive diaspora, some membersofwhich were beinglured home byWestern-level salariespaid bycharities. Perhapstheycould pull oﬀa similartrick. The assertive approach wasepitomisedbythe Liberia Reconstruction and Devel-opmentCommittee, orLRDC. Thissmall,focused group metmonthly, usuallychaired bythe presidentand attended onlybythe mostseniorministersand largest aidagencies. Itsetthe broad direction of devel-opmentpolicyand tracked progress. TheLRDC did good work: Antoinette Sayeh, theﬁnance ministeratthe time, saysit wases-peciallyuseful fornailingdown a poverty-reduction strategy. Itmaywell have re-duced duplication ofeﬀort. Yetitsoon became clearthataid agen-cieswould noteasilybe corralled. Minis-terswere called into seeminglyendless,distractingmeetingswith them—“every-bodywho doesn’tmeetthe ministerofﬁ-nance feelsupset,” saysMsSayeh. Donorssometimesfailed to tell the governmenthowmuch theywere spending, orwhattheywere spendingiton. And, despite thepromisesmade in Paris, aid continued to godirectlyon programmesratherthan pass-ingthrough the state. Thatstill happens.Only12% ofaid to Liberia in the 2015-16 ﬁs-cal yearwas“on-budget”. Aid agenciesare often barred from giv-ingmoneydirectlyto governments, eitherformallyorbecause politiciansbackhomepersuade them notto. And anybodywhooperatesin Liberia hasan obviousexcuseforbypassingstate systems. Amongothersad superlatives, Liberia isbyone measurethe world’smostcorruptcountry: 70% ofbusinessestold surveyorsforthe WorldBankthattheyhad been asked forbribes.One poll suggeststhathalfofLiberianswho interactwith medical clinicians, andtwo-thirdsofthose who encountercops,paybribesordo favoursforthem. (As yourcorrespondentwasleavingLiberia, a mem-berofthe airportstaﬀsuggested that someBritish banknoteswould make “a nice sou-venir”; journalists, however, are good atfeigningincomprehension.) ManyLiberian civil servantsare formerﬁghterswho were given jobsto buytheirgood behaviour. Othersdo notexist: theyare “ghosts” whose paygoesto someoneelse. Since 2015 the education ministryhasremoved some 1,900 ghostsfrom the pay-roll. Although the civil service isgraduallyimproving, itcannotdrawthe mosttalent-ed Liberians. Startingsalariesare too low,especiallycompared with whatthe do-norscan oﬀer. JamesCooper, an ITand pol-iticsgraduate who hasworked fora Liberi-an senator, saysaid agenciesand charitiespayaboutthree timesasmuch. Gradually, the diﬃcultiesofoperatingin Liberia eroded the idealisticpromisesaboutgovernment-led development. Thenthe governmentlostinterest. In 2010, aftermuch manoeuvring, MsSirleafwon a co-lossal write-down ofLiberia’sdebtsunderthe HeavilyIndebted PoorCountriespro-gramme (see chart2). In the afterglowofthatvictory, the LRDCwaswound up. Aidwould henceforth be overseen largelybyministers, ratherthan the president—a bigmistake. With the chieflessinvolved, driftsetin. Whereasall ministersfeltcompelledto attend meetingschaired bythe presi-dent, theyfeltfree to skip meetings calledbyotherministers. The aid agenciesbeganto do more orlessastheypleased. He who pays the piperTodayrelationsbetween donorsand min-istersare cordial, and the aid agencies stilljustifytheirprojectsbypointingto nation-al plans. ButfewthinkLiberia’sgovern-mentisin control. MrDavisdescribes thesituation as“chaos”. Clarence Moniba, aministerwho chairsthe PhilanthropySec-retariat, a steeringgroup, saysthe state haslittle swayoverthe roughly330 charitiesworkingin Liberia. “Theycome and tell uswhattheyare doing, and we agree.” The costofthispoorco-ordination isimpossible to measure precisely, butisprobablyhigh. Unlessa governmentiswhollycorrupt(and Liberia’sisnot) ithastwo bigadvantagesovera donor. First, itismostlyinterested in outcomes. Aid agen-ciesand charitiesoften focuson inputs—the numberofclinicsbuilt, the number offarmersusingsuperiorhybrid seeds. Gov-ernmentscare more aboutmortalityrates,food pricesand the like. Those are whatmatterin the end. Second, governmentstake a nationalview. Donorsoften do not.

Partly,he thinks, “because people sense that’swhere the aid is”.The upperlayersofthe Liberian gov-ernmentare thickwith American-educat-ed technocratswho are admired bythe aidagenciesand able to cope with theircom-plexdemands.

Thecountryhas, forexample, simpliﬁed busi-nessrules, required governmentemploy-eesto disclose theirassetsand enacted anewprocurementlaw.Gifts with reservationDigbelowthe surface, though, and pro-blemsabound. Knowinghumble bureau-cratsto be much lesscapable, donors havelargelybypassed ministriesand deliveredservicesaround them. Thatismore evi-dentin some departmentsthan others.Considerhealth and education. Atthe end ofthe civil warLiberia hadabout50 doctorsand hardlyanyequip-mentormedicines. Fora fewyearshealthserviceswere provided almostentirely bycharities. Butthe countryhad an impres-sive health minister, WalterGwenigale,who had stuckoutthe wardoingsurgeryin a rural hospital, where he occasionallyhad to persuade ﬁghtersto leave their gunsoutside. With the help ofsympathetic aidagencies, he created a fundingmechanismthatsplitthe diﬀerence between a charita-ble programme and a governmentagency.Donors(notablyIrish Aid and DfID, Brit-ain’said department) payinto a healthpool fund, which distributesmoneyas thegovernmentseesﬁt. Although the health pool fund distrib-uteslittle more than $5m a year, and prob-ablyaccountsforabouta tenth ofmedicalaid to Liberia, ithasproved hugelyuseful.Ithasbeen used to payformedical care inpartsofLiberia where foreign aid agenciesdo notoperate. Itseemsto have made bu-reaucratsmore competent: the health min-istryiswidelyregarded asamongLiberia’smostadept. The pool fund helped keep ba-sichealth servicestickingover—just bare-ly—when Liberia wasstruckbyEbola in2014. Disease and premature death are stillappallinglycommon, buttheyare becom-inglessso. The mortalityrate forchildrenyoungerthan ﬁve hascome down from 182per1,000 in the year2000 to 70 per1,000 in2015. On some measures, Liberia isnow alittle healthierthan better-oﬀAfricancountriessuch asNigeria. Education, bycontrast, isa jumble.Do-norsalmostalwaysfund projectsoftheirown, wieldingbudgetsthatcan be aslargeasthe state’s. The ministryhasan annualbudgetof$44m, ofwhich all butabout$7m goeson salaries. Bycontrast, a singleeducation scheme paid forbyUSAIDanddelivered bya Boston-based charity, whichaimsto reach 48,000 out-of-school chil-dren, hasa budgetof$34m. “Ifthe resourceswere puttogether, theywould be adequate in achievingthe resultswe want,” saysMrWerner. Notonlydoesthatnothappen; the education ministryand the aid agenciessometimespull in op-posite directions. Shocked bythe persis-tentweaknessofLiberia’sschools(only35% ofwomen who attended secondaryschool can read a full sentence), the minis-terhasinvited charitiesand educationﬁrmsto manage 93 publicschools. Donorsdisapprove, and are withholdingsome aidfrom those schools. The resultisa mess. Justin Sandefur ofthe Centre forGlobal Development, who isassessingLiberia’seducation experiment,hasdescribed itas“an education system ofstand-alone aid projects, a ministrywithno budget, and no one runninga coherent,overall policyplanningprocess”.Liberia isextreme. No countryin themodern era hassuﬀered such a destructivewarand become so dependenton aid. Butthe Liberian government’sdiﬃcultiesarehardlyunique. Aid analystshave arguedforyearsthataid-dependentcountries sel-dom manage to build resilientgovern-mentsand wean themselvesoﬀcharity(two thatdid are South Korea and Taiwan).In 2004 Deborah Bräutigam and StephenKnack—the formeran academic, the latteraWorld Bankeconomist—showed thathigh levelsofaid wenthand-in-hand withweakgovernance and lowtaxrevenuesinAfrican countries. Otherresearchershavefound much the same. Sierra Leone, to the north, hasa diﬀer-enthistory, diﬀerentneeds, a diﬀerent con-stellation ofcharitiesand aid agencies—and similarproblems.

On June29th 2007 the iPhone ﬁrstwenton sale.Since then Apple hassold some 1.2bnphonesand notched up more than $740bnin salesfrom the bestsellingtech gadget inhistory(see charton nextpage). Two-thirdsofApple’s$216bn in salesin 2016 camefrom the iPhone.Atop a hill there isusuallynowhere togo butdown. Questionsaboutthe futureofthe iPhone and whetherApple will everdesign anotherproductto match itpursuethe company. The relentlessrise ofsmart-phone ownership isslowing, with aroundtwo-ﬁfthsofthe global population nowowningone. Apple isalso facingmorecompetition, especiallyin China (its sec-ond mostimportantmarketafterNorthAmerica) where saleshave been declining,lendingweightto fearsthatApple is experi-encing“peakiPhone”. Even though Apple hasbeen spending$10bn a yearon research and develop-ment, “people aren’tbankingon innova-tion”, saysAmitDaryanani ofRBCCapitalMarkets, a bank. Thathelpsto explain whythe ﬁrm’ssharesare valued on a price-to-earningsratio ofaround ten timesits fore-cast2018 earnings(strippingoutcash), low-erthan the 12-14 timesthatthe information-technologyindustrytradeson. Certainly, Apple’sattemptsto diversifyawayfrom itshitproducthave beenﬂawed. One disappointmenthasbeentelevision, worth some $260bn globally. ItsTVoﬀeringisa cable boxthatislittle morethan a portal to contentfrom otherﬁrms,such asNetﬂix, notthe disruptive oﬀeringthatApple executivespromised. There isalso justiﬁed scepticism aboutanotherpossible avenue forgrowth: per-sonal transportation, an industrythat isworth some $10trn. In June, forthe ﬁrsttime, Tim Cook, Apple’schiefexecutive,publiclydiscussed the ﬁrm’sambition todevelop an autonomous-carsystem. Ap-ple could surelydesign a sleekcar, but thebigshiftisawayfrom ownership towardtransportation asa service. Routingcars tospeciﬁcplaces, asUberdoes, isa leap. Manypeople believe thatApple couldexpand in health care, on which peoplespend an estimated $8trn each yearglobal-ly.

IfApple can keep a lead on inte-gratingARinto itssoftware, thatwouldalso give usersa reason to keep on prefer-ringthe iPhone overcheapersmart-phones. Thiswill be particularlyhelpful inChina, where local brandssuch asVivoand OPPOhave taken share—lastsummerOPPO’sR9 phone, which costsjust$400,overtookthe iPhone in the country.

ForyearsBanca Popolare di Vicenza andVeneto Banca, in the prosperousVeneto, innorth-eastItaly, had been plagued by mis-management. Even criminal investiga-tionsare underway. Formonthsthe Italiangovernmenthad been wranglingwithEuropean authoritiesoverthe termsof abail-out. Forweeksithad seemed improb-able thatprivate investorswould put inmoneyalongside the state, asthe Euro-pean Commission insisted.On June 23rd the European CentralBank(ECB) declared thatthe bankswere“failingorlikelyto fail”. Two dayslater,aftera franticweekend, the Italian govern-mentpronounced them dead: theirgoodassetswere sold to Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’ssecond-biggestlender, fora token €1($1.14),and theirdud onesputinto a “bad bank”.The operation maycostItalian taxpayers€17bn. Thisisthe second call on Italy’spub-licpurse thismonth. On June 1stthe com-mission approved, in principle, the rescueoflong-troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena,the fourth-biggestbank, which isexpectedto costthe state €6.6bn. The Veneto banks’ clientsbreathed asigh ofreliefwhen branchesopened onJune 26th. So did the stockmarket: banksharesrose. So did holdersofthe lenders’seniorbonds, which will be taken on by In-tesa. In earlyJune theyhad traded at below74 centson the euro. Theyjumped to above(both seniorand junior) and deposits over€100,000 musttake losses, to the value of8% oftotal liabilities, before public moneyisinjected into a bank. Shareholders andjuniorbondholderswere wiped out, butseniorcreditorswere spared. Taxpayersdid notpaya cent; Santanderwill raise€7bn in equity.The SRBdealtwith the Italian pair dif-ferently. Itjudged thatitwas“notwarrant-ed in the publicinterest” to putthem intoresolution. Theirdemise would nothave a“signiﬁcantadverse impacton ﬁnancialstability”, because oftheirlimited inter-connectionswith otherbanks. (Atthe endof2016 theywere Italy’s10th- and 11th-big-gestbyassets.) The SRBinstead decidedthattheyshould be dealtwith underItal-ian insolvencylaw. Shareholdersandholdersofjuniordebtwill suﬀerlosses,though retail investors, who own €200min juniorbonds, will be compensated for“mis-selling”; Italian banksroutinelysoldsuch bondsto retail customers. Seniorcreditorswere untouched.Although the board sawno riskto sta-bility, the governmentperceived a dangerto the Veneto’seconomy. Intesa will bepaid €3.5bn to oﬀsetthe eﬀectofthe extraassetson itscapital ratios. Itwill also get€1.3bn to coverintegration costs, includingthe closure ofaround 600 branches. Itsmarketshare in the region will rise to 30%.Mediobanca, an investmentbank, esti-matesthe acquisitionswill yield proﬁts of€250m by2020. The governmentisalsoputtingup €12bn in guaranteesagainstpo-tential losses, although itexpectsto spendonlya small fraction ofthat; and some ofthe banks’ seniordebtwasstate-guaran-teed, so itmayhave saved moneythere.The commission’scompetition arm ap-proved the aid.

Thedeal also freesmoneyin Atlante, a fundbacked byItalian ﬁnancial institutions,which had been earmarked forbuyingtheVeneto banks’ bad loans. Itmaynowbespenton Monte dei Paschi’s. Critics—mostvocally, some GermanMEPs—lamentthe splurge ofpublicmon-ey: Europe’snewrules, afterall, are sup-posed to discourage that. Theyargue thatthe bail-outhasputpaid to Europe’spro-posed “bankingunion”, in which one setofrulesshould applyto all. Thatis over-blown, saysNicolasVéron ofBruegel, aBrusselsthink-tank, and the Peterson Insti-tute forInternational Economicsin Wash-ington, DC. Bankingunion isincomplete:thisepisode servesasa reminder. “The sin-gle resolution mechanism isnotreally sin-gle aslongasyouhave diﬀerentinsolven-cyregimesforbanks,” saysMrVéron.Moreover, given the wretched state ofthe Veneto banks, theiracquirercould de-mand a dowry; Santanderwaswillingtoraise moneyto absorb an essentiallysound Popular. Arguably, Italyshould havesorted outitsmesssooner, before Europe’sstricterbail-outrulescame into force; butithasspenta pittance compared with whatothercountriesshelled outafterthe ﬁnan-cial crisis. Italy’spile ofnon-performingloans isatlastshrinking. Butworrieslinger—notablyaboutCarige, a Genoese bank. While theeconomycontinuesto crawl, manylend-erswill struggle forproﬁt. Although con-solidation istakingplace, Italy’sbankbranchesstill outnumberitspizzerias; de-spite recentreform, recoveryofbad debtsisstill slow. Bail-outsare forgivable—if theymean a fresh start. Time forItaly, if itcan, toprove the doubterswrong.7WHENthe ﬁnancial crisiswasat itsheightin 2008, beinga debtorwas adreadful experience. Banksand compa-niesscrambled desperatelyto getthe ﬁ-nancingtheyneeded.Butthe balance ofpowerin the ﬁnan-cial marketscan easilyshift. In 2005 and2006, credithad been easyto geton gener-ousterms. Notonlywere loanscheap andplentiful; theyalso suﬀered from fewer re-strictions. Until then, corporate loans hadmanycovenantsoﬀeringsafeguardsforlendersifthe debtor’sﬁnancial positionwere to deteriorate. But2005-06 sawtheemergence of“covenant-lite” loansinwhich such restrictionswere virtuallynon-existent.The cycle hasturned again. AnalysisbyMoody’s, a ratingsagency, showsthatthe proportion ofthe loan marketthat is“covenant-lite” hasrisen from 27% in 2015to more than two-thirdsin the ﬁrst quar-terofthisyear(see chart). Some loanseven contain restrictionson the lender,notjustthe borrower. Private-equityﬁrmsdemand a veto oversecondary-marketbuyersofloanstheyowe; the ideaisto avoid the debtbeingboughtby activ-istinvestorswho mightmake demandson a company’smanagement.Investorsare willingto acceptsuchtermsbecause theyare desperate to earnsome kind ofyield on theirassets. In thepasteightyears, central banksin devel-oped economieshave pushed interestratesclose to zero. Government-bondyieldshave also been athistoriclows, andsome have even been negative. When low-riskassetsoﬀera poor re-turn, investorsare willingto take more ofachance. Attimeslike this, Wall Street al-wayshasa suitable setofinitials to ﬂog.Thistime, itisthe collateralised loan obli-gation (CLO), which bundlesloansto-getherinto a diversiﬁed portfolio. Aswithsubprime mortgagesa decade ago, theseportfoliosare then divided into diﬀerenttranches, to oﬀerhigherreturns(at higherrisk). CLOissuance so farthisyearis doublethe amountraised in the same period of2016, accordingto WellsFargo, a bank.Investors’ enthusiasm isnotjustcon-ﬁned to loans. Argentina recentlyissued a100-yearbond, despite itshistoryofrepeat-ed defaults. With a 7.9% yield, investorsclearlygambled theycould geta decent re-turn on the bond before Argentina hits eco-nomictrouble again.Anotherreason whyinvestorsare morewillingto take on riskistheirbelief thattheglobal economy, and the health ofthe cor-porate sector, are both improving. The glo-bal defaultrate on speculative bonds isdown to 3.3% overthe past12 months, ac-cordingtoS&P Global, anotherratingsagency; atthe startofthe year, the defaultrate was4.2%. Manycompanieshave takenadvantage ofa longperiod oflowinterestratesto reﬁnance theirdebts. Butisthe enthusiasm forCLOsand cov-enant-lite loansa sign ofthe same specula-tive excessthatfrothed in the middle ofthepreviousdecade? There are otherstraws inthe wind. The BankofEngland warnedthisweekthatconsumers’ debtin Britainwasrisingfasterthan incomesand askedbanksto putaside more capital to coverthe riskofbad debts. On a scale of one toten, one bankerdescribesthe current lev-el ofinvestoreuphoria as“abouteight”. The good newsisthatanyshake-out inthe marketshould be more containedthan itwasin the daysofBearStearns andLehman Brothers, whose collapse precip-itated the 2008 crisis. The ﬁnancial sys-tem isnotasfragile asitwasa decade ago;bankshave more capital and are probablycarryinglessofthisspeculative debt ontheirown balance-sheets. Nevertheless, itishard to escape thefeelingthatthe marketisbeingkept aloftbythe actionsofcentral banks. The Euro-pean Central Bank(ECB) and BankofJa-pan are still buyingtensofbillions ofdol-lars’ worth ofassetseverymonth. Thatkeepsyieldsdown and promptsinvestorsto seekalternatives. MattKing, a strategistatCitigroup, thinksthatglobal centralbankshave to keep creating$1.2trn a yearjustto keep the marketsfrom selling oﬀ. Thatcreatesthe potential fora game ofchicken between central banksand themarkets. The Federal Reserve isnowpushingup interestratesand mayreducethe size ofitsbalance-sheet. China isalsotighteningpolicy; and Mario Draghi oftheECBsaid thisweekthat“deﬂationaryforceshave been replaced byreﬂationaryones.” Central bankswill move cautious-lybecause theydo notwantto trigger acreditcrunch. Butinvestorsare aware ofthisconcern, and mayreckon thatpolicywill be eased again atthe ﬁrstsign oftrou-ble; asa result, theymaywell keep lend-ing.

Aproductofthe post-crisisDodd-Frankact, the testsare intended to make sure thatlendershave enough equityon hand should catas-trophe strike again. Butbankssaythey areboth opaque and burdensome. And be-cause failure can mean a blockon payouts,the testshave bred caution and ire.The time forcaution seemsto be over.On June 28th the Fed said ithad approvedthe dividend and buy-backplansofall 34bankstested thisyear—planswhich pro-pose handingshareholdersa pile ofcash.All 34 also passed the ﬁrststage, results ofwhich were revealed sixdaysearlierandwhich assume no repurchasesand un-changed dividends. Even undera “severe-lyadverse” scenario involvinga nastyre-cession, all would keep keycapital ratiosabove the regulatoryminimum.Payoutsare likelyto be close to 100% ofthe industry’sexpected earningsoverthenextfourquarters. Accordingto analysts atBarclays, thatwould be the highestratiosince 2007 and (more remarkably) the sec-ond-highestin the past20 years.Several bankspublished theirplansshortlyafterthe Fed’sannouncement.JPMorgan Chase intendsto repurchase$19.4bn-worth ofsharesoverthe nextyear,up from $10.6bn in lastyear’splan, andplansto increase itsquarterlydividendfrom 50 to 56 cents. Citigroup will doubleitsdividend and return $18.9bn to share-holdersin all, comfortablymore than itislikelyto earn. BankofAmerica will buyback$12bn in shares, havingproposed just$5bn a yearago, and raise itsdividend by60%, to 12 cents.

Both banksmake mostoftheirmoneyfrom creditcards, which were hard hitunderthe Fed’sbleakestscenario in the ﬁrststage of tests.Havingadded $750bn in equitysince2009, bigbanksdo notjustwantto paymore to shareholders.

Ministers initsbusiness-minded rulingparty, the Paki-stan Muslim League-Nawaz(PML-N), boastofa record thatmeansthe countrycan payitsown bills. “We will notgo backto theIMFprogramme,” declared Ishaq Dar, theﬁnance minister, in May, almosta yearafterthe completion ofPakistan’smostre-cent, $6.6bn bail-out. In a countrythat mis-trustsWestern assistance and where prot-estersportraytheIMFasa bloodthirstycrocodile, such wordshave a headyap-peal. Buttheyringhollow. On June 16th theIMFwarned ofre-emerging“vulnerabilities” in Pakistan’seconomy. Itpraised GDPgrowth ofabove5% a year, butnoted missed ﬁscal targetsand a ballooningcurrent-accountdeﬁcit.The fund’sown projectionsa yearago forthe ﬁscal yearendingthisJune underesti-mated thisdeﬁcitbyabouthalfthe ﬁnal to-tal of$9bn. And based on trendsin earlyApril itoverestimated the ﬁscal-year-endforeign-exchange reservesby$3bn. Independenteconomistspointoutthat,manytimesbefore, collapse hascome onthe heelsofan IMFprogramme’sconclu-sion. Sakib Sherani, a formergovernmenteconomist, saysthatto avoid “eggon itsface” forcheerleadingPakistan’seconomicrecoveryjustmonthsago, the IMFisslowlychangingitsstory. Bythe end of2018, manypredict, Pakistan will come beggingagain.The fund respondsthatitis“too earlytospeculate”. Some ofPakistan’sfalteringcan beblamed on bad luck, such asa fall in remit-tancesfrom workersin the Middle East. Butmostlyitwas, asusual, bad policy. Like itspredecessors, the PML-Nhasfailed to enactthe structural reformsneeded to breakPakistan free ofitscycle ofcrises. Barelyanygoalsofthe IMF’sprogramme weremet. Bloated, underperformingor, in thecase ofPakistan Steel Mills, closed-downpublicly-owned enterprisesdrain millionsfrom the governmenteach month. “Circu-lar” debt, caused bydelayed paymentsalongthe electricity-generation chain, isswampingthe energysectoronce more.Annual exportshave declined by20%in dollartermssince 2013, stymied byanovervalued currency. All thismeansthegovernmentisagain borrowinghand overﬁstfrom local and foreign banks. In somecasesthe design ofthe IMFprogramme it-selfhasadded to Pakistan’swoes: bypush-ingforincreased taxrevenue above all else,ithasallowed the governmentto clobberthe poorwith indirecttaxes, milkthe (few)directtaxpayerseven further, and, as ever,ignore the wealthyelites. To make mattersworse, instead ofsnappingitsjawsatPakistan’sfailure tomeettargets, theIMFmeeklyindulged itspartner, arguesKhurram Husain, a jour-nalistworkingon a bookaboutthe rela-tionship between Pakistan and the IMF. Itkeptacting“like an ATM machine”, he says,even asPakistan kicked seriousreform intothe longgrass. The IMFhaslongbeen accused ofgoingsofton Pakistan, mindful ofitsnuclearweapons, boisterousjihadisand proxim-ityto war-torn Afghanistan. SuccessivePakistani governmentshave exploited thesense thattheircountryistoo dangerous tofail. Theyhave taken out12IMFloanssince1988.

And thelikesofMrAunspach, an American dis-placed bytrade, are the objectsofkeen at-tention from wonksaswell aspoliticians. Hisisan old problem, with old sol-utions.

Workersover50 can gettheirwagestopped up by50% ofthe diﬀerence between theirnewand old wages. The moneyshould helpcushion the ﬁnancial blow, and temptthem towardson-the-job training.On paper, TAAshould make wonksglow. Itprotectsworkers, notjobs, andlinksqualiﬁcationsto local demand.

MsHaskinsknowsofone coal supplierwho, 18 monthsafterthe Warricksmelterclosed, isstill waitingforapproval forthe 30 employeeshe letgo.Americanshave been turningelsewhere.David Autor, David Dorn and GordonHanson, three economists, have estimatedthatofthe extra governmentpayments as-sociated with Chinese importcompetitionbetween 1990 and 2007, only6% camethrough TAAorunemploymentinsurance.Mostcame from othersources: 32% fromdisabilityorretirementinsurance; 26% asfederal-governmentincome assistance;and 32% asextra medical spending.Historically, TAAhashad narroweligi-bilitycriteria: foritsﬁrstseven years no onequaliﬁed. Since then, coverage hasundu-lated, expandingin 2009 to include peoplein service industries, then contracting in2014 asthe provision expired. Nowtheyare covered again, butonlyuntil 2021. The scheme can be confusingand ad-ministrativelycomplex. Worse, mostAmericanshave notheard ofit; itcan alsobe diﬃcultto avoid the stigma associatedwith gettingstate help, reckonsMrAun-spach. Howard Rosen, an architectofthecurrentTAAlawand executive director ofthe Trade AdjustmentAssistance Co-alition, a lobbygroup, complainsthat suc-cessive governmentshave failed to pushTAA: “We like to have programmes, but wedon’twantpeople to use them.” BuildingsupportforTAA mightbe easi-erifevidence ofitsbeneﬁtswere more sol-id.

Butsuccessrelative to the amountspenton it, or rela-tive to otherschemes, ishazier. Notmade to measureThe TAAwassetup withoutanypropersystem to gauge itseﬀectiveness. Its mostrecentthorough assessment, in 2013, foundthatrecipientshad lowerincomesthansimilarpeople receivingunemploymentinsurance overitsﬁrstfouryears.

Until July2nd, thatincludesan exhibition onthe Asian ﬁnancial crisis, which began on thatdate 20 yearsago,when the Thai bahtlostitspegwith the dollar. The exhibition fea-turestwo seesaws, showinghowmanybahtwere required tobalance one dollar, both before the crisis(25) and after(over50 atone point). Visitorscan also read the testimonyofsome ofthe vic-tims, includinga high-ﬂyingstockbrokerwho wasreduced to sell-ingsandwiches, and a businesswoman whose bosstold her to“take care ofthe workforme” before hanginghimself. (In HongKong, Japan and South Korea, 10,400 people killed themselvesasaresultofthe crisis, accordingto subsequentresearch.) In Thai-land the ﬁnancial calamitybecame known asthe tom yumkungcrisis, afterthe local hot-and-soursoup, presumablybecause itwassuch a bitterand searingexperience.The exhibition’ssubtitle, “Lessons(Un)learned”, seemsun-fair. The victimsofthe crisis(Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, In-donesia and HongKong) tookmanylessonsto heart. With the ex-ception ofHongKong, theyno longerrelyon a hard peg to thedollarto anchorinﬂation, givingtheircurrenciesmore room tomove. (The sandwich vendor’schosen logo forhisnewbusinesswasa balloon thatﬂoatslike the baht.) Theyborrowchieﬂyintheirown currencies, so theirliabilitiesno longerjump whentheirexchange ratesfall. And where necessary, theytry to neu-tralise heavycapital inﬂowswith oﬀsettingﬂowsthe otherway,includingcentral-bankpurchasesofforeign-exchange reserves.The change isevidentin Asia’strade and current-accountbal-ances. On the eve ofthe crisis, Thailand, forexample, wasimport-ingfarmore than itexported, borrowingfrom foreigners to bridgethe gap. In 1996, itscurrent-accountdeﬁcitamounted to about 8%ofGDP. Twentyyearslater, ithad a surplusofover11%.The harderquestion iswhetherlearningthese lessons isenough to protectan emergingmarketin Asia orelsewhere fromfuture mishaps. Afterall, Asia did notsee the 1997 crisiscomingpreciselybecause itthoughtithad learned the lessons from earli-ercrises. Unlike the proﬂigate Latin Americans, forexample, theAsian countrieshad high national savingrates, limited publicdebtand budgetsurpluses. In 1996, Thailand’scentral-govern-mentdebtwasunder5% ofGDP. So far, the lessonsof1997 have aged well. The victimsofthatregional crisissuﬀered relativelylittle from the global version of2008 (although, despite South Korea’sdollarreserves, some of itscorporatessuﬀered dollarshortages). Onlyone ofthem (Indone-sia, which had allowed itscurrent-accountdeﬁcitto widen)counted amongthe “fragile ﬁve” emergingeconomies, which in2013 proved vulnerable to higherAmerican bond yields.Butnoteveryone issatisﬁed. Hyun SongShin ofthe Bank forInternational Settlements, emphasisesone newthreat, againstwhich the lessonsof1997 would notnecessarilyaﬀord protec-tion. He arguesthateven countriesthatmaintain ﬂoating ex-change ratesand have little visible foreign-currencydebt can suf-ferﬁnancial strain (asin 2013), iftheircompanies’ foreignsubsidiariesborrowtoo much. Thisoﬀshore moneycan relax ﬁ-nancial conditionsbackhome, MrShin argues, even ifit isnotnecessarilyrepatriated. Thisisbecause companiesrolling inmoneyoﬀshore will leave more oftheironshore moneyin thebank. Sure enough, IMFresearch showsthatfrom 2009-13 ﬁrmsfrom middle-income countriesboth raised a lotofoﬀshore debtand expanded theironshore deposits, leavingtheirhome-coun-trybanksﬂush with cash. From soup to nutsUnfortunately, when the Federal Reserve tightens, the dollarstrengthensand the oﬀshore marketsbecome lessaccommodat-ing, thisprocesscan go into reverse. Multinationalsthat suddenlycannotraise moneyabroad make greaterdemandson domesticbanks, withdrawingdepositsand requestingloans. Thistightensﬁnancial conditions, even ifthe local central bank, proud ofitsﬂoatingexchange rate and independentmonetarypolicy, hasnotitselfraised interestrates.Ifthe oﬀshore moneyisneverrepatriated, itwill not registerinthe oﬃcial statisticsasa capital inﬂow. Policymakers attuned tothe lessonsof1997 maynotpayitenough attention. Theymay besurprised, therefore, howlittle theirﬂoatingcurrency and limitedforeign debtinsulate them from global ﬁnancial conditions. Adiﬀerentargumentisthatemergingeconomieshavelearned the lessonsofthe 1997 crisistoo well. In tryingto safe-guard ﬁnancial stability, have theysacriﬁced too muchgrowth—orperhapsjeopardised stabilityelsewhere?Before the crisis, Asia maintained extraordinaryrates ofcapi-tal expenditure bysupplementingitsown savingwith saving im-ported from the restofthe world. Afterthe crisis, it curbed thatnetforeign borrowing, butonlybyslashinginvestment(see chart).Some ofthatpre-crisisinvestmentwasextravagantand waste-ful.

Notall coun-triescan run current-accountsurpluses(which mustbe matchedbydeﬁcitselsewhere). Therefore, noteverycountrycan fullyabide bythe lessonsofthe Asian ﬁnancial crisis.Thailand, the museum exhibition pointsout, used to imagineitselfasthe region’s“ﬁfth tiger”.

MrGoodfellowobservedthat, although deep learningallowed ma-chinesto discriminate marvellouslywellbetween diﬀerentsortsofdata (a picture ofacatvone ofa dog, say), software that triedto generate picturesofdogsorcatswasnothinglike asgood. Itwashard for a com-puterto workthrough a large numberoftrainingimagesin a database and thencreate a meaningful picture from them. MrGoodfellowturned to a familiarconcept: competition. Instead ofasking thesoftware to generate somethinguseful in avacuum, he gave itanotherpiece ofsoft-ware—an adversary—to push against. Theadversarywould lookatthe generated im-agesand judge whethertheywere “real”,meaningsimilarto those thatalready exist-ed in the generative software’strainingda-tabase.

Fordecades, though, therehasbeen a fearthattheyharm non-crop-eatinginsects, too—in particular, bees. The evidence forthishasbeen mixed.Swedish research published in 2015—twoyearsafterthe EUimposed a moratoriumon the use ofthree popularneonicoti-noids, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thia-methoxam—found thatwild beesin ﬁeldssown with neonicotinoid-treated oilseedrape (canola) reproduced poorly. Yetotherﬁeld studieshave found no discernible ef-fectson eitherwild-bee orhoneybee popu-lations. Two studiespublished in Scienceon June 30th add to the case against. The ﬁrst, byBen Woodcockofthe Cen-tre forEcologyand Hydrologyin Walling-ford, Oxfordshire, and colleagues, wasfunded in partbyBayerCropScience, mak-erofclothianidin, and Syngenta, maker ofthiamethoxam. The scientists, notthe fun-ders, controlled the design and executionofthe research. Neonicotinoidsare frequentlyused totreatseedsratherthan sprayed on to grow-ingcrops. Thismeansthe plants’ edible tis-suesare laced with insecticide from the be-ginning, butthe restofthe environment islessaﬀected. Still, some ofthe insecticidegetsinto the plants’ pollen and nectar, andthusinto bees. The Wallingford study com-pared beesthatfed on rape plantsgrownfrom clothiainidin- orthiamethoxam-treated seedswith those thatfed on un-treated plants. The research wascarried outat33 sitesin Britain, Germanyand Hungary. Theteam found thatthiamethoxam-treatedseedsappeared to have no signiﬁcant ef-fecton honeybee numbers. Honeybee col-oniesthatfed on rape treated with clothia-nidin had fewerworkersthe yearafter thetreatmentin Britain and Hungary—butnotin Germany. The diﬀerentresultsin diﬀer-entcountriescould help to explain whypaststudieshave reached inconsistentconclusions. The German beesatcontrolsiteswhere there were no insecticide-treated plantswere healthierthan the beesin the othercountries’ control groups. Rapepollen also made up lessoftheirdiet. The researchersalso measured the ne-onicotinoidsin the nestsofwild bees,where theyfound tracesofa third com-mon neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, too.Buﬀ-tailed bumblebees(Bombusterrestris)with nestscontaininghigh total concentra-tionsofthese three pesticidesproducedfewerqueens; red mason bees(Osmia bi-cornis) exposed to them made fewereggs. In the second study, Amro Zayed ofYorkUniversityin Toronto and hiscol-leaguesmeasured the insecticide inside 55honeybee hives. Theyfound bee coloniesclose to ﬁeldsofmaize grown from treatedseedswere exposed to neonicotinoidsfornearly12 weeksofthe bees’ six-month ac-tive period. Much ofthe exposure, surpris-ingly, did notcome directlyfrom maize pol-len butfrom thatofwild ﬂowersandweedswhich picked the compoundsupthrough the soil. The researcherswenton to feed ten col-onieswith an artiﬁcial pollen supplement,lacingthe supplyto halfthose colonieswith clothianidin. Aftera 12-weekregimethatmimicked the pattern ofexposure inthe ﬁelds, the beesthathad grown up inthe hivesgettingspiked food had 23% shor-terlifespansand were poorerforagers.Those hivesalso displayed a certain slov-enliness, with adultslesslikelyto removepupae infected with disease. The team alsofound thata commonlyused fungicide,boscalid, made neonicotinoidstwice astoxicto honeybees.Neonicotinoidshave notbeen foundresponsible forbigdeclinesin bee popula-tions, orwidespread colonycollapses.

Itsmostcontroversial conclusion isthatdullingthose incentivescould be justthe thing adivided societyneeds.7FictionMovingpartsMIGRATIONisgenerallyunderstoodin termsofgeography: relocatingfrom one region to another. Butwhatimpelsthose who move, atleastwhen itisvoluntary, isoften a desire to migratebetween social classes. Itisthisparticularaspectofmigration thatisatthe heart ofNeel Mukherjee’s“AState ofFreedom”,hisfollow-up to “The LivesofOthers”,which wasshortlisted forthe ManBookerprize forﬁction in 2014.

In one, a London-settled Indianreturnsto hisparent’shome in Mumbai.Hisstoryrevolvesaround food: his loveforit, a recipe bookhe iswriting, hisparents’ insistence on overfeedinghim.The tension arisesfrom hisattempts tostrike up a rapportwith Renu, the fam-ily’scook, which hismotherconsidersunwise—servantsmustnotstartthinkingofthemselvesasequals. In another, MrMukherjee relatesthebiographyofMilly, the maid in the samehome. Amemberofthe “backwardcastes”, Millywasraised in the Maoist-infested eastofIndia, from where shewasdispatched atthe age ofeightto workin a nearbytown. Eventuallyshe ends upin Mumbai, marriesa restaurant-worker,and togethertheyearn enough to sendtheirchildren to private school. That ismobilityofa kind, butitisgenerationalratherthan geographical.

Hungerisendemic inone world and unknown in another;violence and tragedyare casuallybornebysome while simple wordscause dis-agreementsamongothers.

Some scientistsrushedto hisdefence, citingresearch thatsuggest-ed thatthiswastrue. “Inferior” byAngela Saini, a Britishjournalistand broadcaster(who haswrit-ten in the pastforThe Economist), isan illu-minatingaccountofhowscience hasstoked the viewsthatinnate preferencesand abilitiesdiﬀerbetween men andwomen. MsSaini unpickssome ofthemostinﬂuential studiesthathave framedwomen asgentle, caringand empatheticand men asstrong, rational and domi-nant—diﬀerencesattributed to biology andevolution.

Designatingwomen asthe weakersexisbiologicallyunfair. The natural sex ratioatbirth isskewed in favourofboys, buttheyare more likelythan girlsto be bornpreterm and die in theirﬁrstyearsof life.Women live longerthan men and recoverfasterwhen theyfall ill. Science is yettoﬁnd outwhy. Men’sbrainsare 8-13% biggerthanwomen’s. In the 19th centurythatwasseenasproofthatmen were the cleverersex.Since then, reamsofresearch have shownthatdiﬀerencesbetween the sexesin cog-nitive abilitiesormotorskillsare verysmall ornon-existent. When diﬀerencesare found, theyare notalwaysin favour ofthe same sexand mayshiftovertime. Girlsin some countriesare nowbetteratmathsthan boys, forexample.

Yetscientistskeep searchingfor sexdif-ferencesin the brain, these dayswith imag-ingmachinesthatmeasure brain activity.Thisline ofresearch relieson human eyeslookingforpatterns, and also on imperfecttechnology(scansofa dead ﬁsh haveshown dotsof“activity” in itsbrain). Suchstudiesgrab headlineswhen theyjuxta-pose cherry-picked imagesofmale and fe-male brainsthatlookdramaticallydiﬀer-entfrom each other. Anylinkstobehavioursorproclivitiesare purely spec-ulative, yetthe media like the ﬁction. In fact, no two brainsare the same: eachisa mosaicoffeatures, some ofwhich aremore common in men and othersin wom-en. Accordingto one analysisofstudies onsexdiﬀerencesin the brain, the proportionofpeople whose brainshad purelymascu-line orfeminine featureswasbetween zeroand 8%. “Inferior” roundsup compellingevi-dence againstseveral otherstereotypesthatcastwomen asnatural caregivers, sex-uallycoyand dependentforsurvival onmen because thatishowevolution sup-posedlyintended it.

According to the NaturalResource Governance Institute’s index,six of the 13 high-income countriesstudied failed to achieve good or satis-factory ratings for the quality of theirnatural-resource governance. Scores arebased on a framework of 133 questions,including ones on extraction rights andcorruption. The majority of the membersof OPEChave poor or failing resourceregimes. Saudi Arabia’s score is draggeddown in part by murkiness surroundingits state oil ﬁrm, Saudi Aramco. Sover-eign wealth funds are another problemarea. The Qatar Investment Authority isranked as one of the worst-governed ofthe 33 funds studied.76The EconomistJuly1st2017WHENGalileo, in 1609, ﬁrstraised his37mm telescope to the Moon, hecould notbelieve whathe saw. Thatsup-posedlysmooth surface wasfull of“cavi-tiesand prominences”, like the face ofasmallpoxvictim. And he had seen themwith an instrumenthe had devised him-self, tryingoutconcave and convexlensesand, in the end, grindinghisown on a ro-tarylathe. Itwashard, noisywork. But sci-entistsin thatage accepted thatthey need-ed to be engineersand craftsmen, aswellasjugglersofequations. When JerryNelson in 1990 sawthe ﬁrstlight-capture byone ofthe twin ten-metretelescopesatthe KeckObservatory,housed in two greatdomeson the dor-mantvolcano ofMauna Kea in Hawaii, hetoo could notbelieve whathe saw: a pin-wheel galaxy, NGC1232, 65m light-yearsaway, sharperthan everbefore. The tele-scope wasnotyetﬁnished, with only aquarterofitslight-capturingcapacity upand running, yetalreadythe image madehim jump up and down with excitement.And he too had seen itwith an instrumenthe had devised himself. Galileo had deﬁed the limitsofthe hu-man eye; MrNelson deﬁed the limitsofthose old dinosaurs, monolithictele-scopes, with one huge heavymirrortrained on the heavens. He grewup withthe Hale telescope on MountPalomarinCalifornia, with a ﬁve-metre mirrorthatseemed to representthe limitoftelescopicpower. Discswiderthan thatdistorted un-dertheirown weightand the variations ofnight-time temperature. So thiswashischallenge when, from 1985 to 2012, he waschiefdesignerofthe Kecktelescope: howto build a mirrortwice asbigasHale’s, sothatscientistscould see fartherinto spaceand, therefore, fartherbackin time—as far,eventually, perhaps, asthe beginning.He had alwaysloved tinkeringwiththings, subliminallyabsorbinghismachin-istfather’sfascination with the propertiesofmetals. AtCaltech, havingswitchedfrom mathsto physicsto studypulsars, healso spenthoursin the campusworkshoplearningto weld and use a lathe, andhelped to build a 1.5-metre telescope fromﬁrstprinciples. Dreamingwasall verywell, he would say, and the world was fullofdreamers; butifyouwanted a carthatcould ﬂyand surf, youshould studythemechanicsand make ityourself. When itcame to telescopes, hisidea—reﬁned in papersasearlyas1977—wastoabandon one concave blankofglassformanyinterlockingmirrortiles, subtlyshaped and angled, which would combineto make one surface. These were so muchlighter(though still weighinghalfa tonneeach), thattheygreatlyreduced gravita-tional distortion. Computerswould con-trol them, makingsure theystayed in cor-rectrelation to one another. He estimatedhe would need, forKeck, 36 such tiles, 168sensorson theiredgesand 108 motorised“actuators” to keep them perfectlyaligned.He called these “whiﬄetrees”, a bitlike theharnesson teamsofhorses: histelescope,“mybaby”, continuallyadjustingitswholesurface asitscanned the nightsky. Reading the nightlogsSome ofthe problemswith the prototypetookyearsforhim and histeam to solve, ashe wrestled with Excel spreadsheetson hisMacto workouthisgiganticscheme. Thetiles, ofsixdiﬀerentshapesbutgenerallyhexagonal, proved devilish to ﬁttogether.Theywere also almostimpossible to pol-ish until he devised a method, based onthe theoryofelasticity, to pull them tempo-rarilyinto sectionsofspheres. Persuadingthe optical machiniststo do thisatscalewaseven harder. Butbehind the longhairand plumpingwaistline, the aloha shirtsand the bare-feet-on-the-desk, MrNelsonwasboth exactingand conﬁdentto cocki-ness. Nothing—notincompetentengi-neers, northe cost-cutters, northe mock-ers—could stop a good idea. And thisonewasso simple, a reallystraightforward al-gorithm: justhigh-school mathematics, hewould saywith a broad smile.When fullyinstalled, in 1992, the light-gatheringcapacityofKeckwasfourtimesHale’s. Itsresolution washalfa second ofarc, or, said itsecstaticfather, “roughlyequivalentto beingable to distinguish acar’sheadlightsastwo objectsata distanceof500 miles”. Adaptive optics, in which healso setthe pace, made the imagesstillsharperbycorrectingforthe blurof Earth’satmosphere. Astronomerscould nowex-amine the giantblackhole within theMilkyWay, calculate from sequential im-agesofexploded supernovae howfasttheuniverse wasreallyexpanding, make spec-tral analysesofstarsto knowtheirsize, ageand chemistry, and measure ripplesin thecosmicweb. Even aftera stroke disabledhim, MrNelson started each dayatthe Uni-versityofCalifornia, Santa Cruz, where hetaughtastronomy, with the nightlogs fromKeck, checkingforthe unexpected. Nordid he wantto stop there. His lastyearswere spentcollaboratingon the Thir-tyMetre Telescope, also planned forMau-na Kea to hissegmented design. Thisoneneeded 492 tiles, buthe sawno inherentlimitto it. The phasesofVenus, ﬁrst ob-served through Galileo’stelescope, hadproved thatEarth wasnotthe centre of theuniverse. Observationsthrough one of hismightprove thatEarth wasnotalone insupportinglife. Human beingsjusthad togo on looking, and engineeringbetterwaysto do it. Itwasall loadsoffun. 7The mirrorand the starsJerryNelson, astronomerand telescope-designer, died on June 10th, aged 73ObituaryJerry Nelsoneconomistsubscriptions.com/1843ON NEWSSTANDS NOWJUNE/JULY  ISSUEThe trials of modern masculinityIs wine-tasting bunk?Kenya’s wild frontierDesigning for deathThe man with the most RembrandtsHigh-tech sailing Teaching robots  right from wrongHow artificial intelligence is learning moralityA new magazine of ideas, lifestyle and culture
