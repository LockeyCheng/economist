Backthen, the country wasabridge between the EuropeanUnion and BarackObama’sAmerica. Itseconomywasonthe mend afteryearsofsqueezed livingstandards. Scot-tish independence had justbeen ruled out. Labour’smostcon-troversial policywasa plan to cap energyprices, denounced as“Marxist” bythe Tories, who wenton to win.TodayBritain ﬁndsitselfin a diﬀerentera. The vote forBrexithascommitted itto leavingitsbiggesttrading partnerand snugglingcloserto others, includinga less-welcomingAmerica. The economyhasheld up betterthan manyfearedbutgrowth isslowing; investorsare jittery. The union isfrayingagain. Real wageshave stagnated. Publicservicesare stretched.Political partieshave responded in radicallydiﬀerent ways.All have replaced theirleaders. JeremyCorbyn hastaken La-bourto the loonyleft, proposingthe heaviesttaxburden sincethe second world war. The Conservative prime minister, The-resa May, promisesa hard exitfrom the EU. The Liberal Demo-cratswould go fora softversion, oreven reverse it.The partyleaderscould hardlydiﬀermore in their style andbeliefs. And yeta thread linksthe two possible winners ofthiselection. Though theysiton diﬀerentpointsofthe left-rightspectrum, the Toryand Labourleadersare united in their de-sire to pull up Britain’sdrawbridge to the world. Both Mrs Mayand MrCorbyn would each in theirown waystep backfromthe ideasthathave made Britain prosper—itsfree markets,open bordersand internationalism. Theywould junka politi-cal settlementthathaslasted fornearly40 yearsand inﬂu-enced a generation ofWestern governments(see page 15).Whetherleftorrightprevails, the loserwill be liberalism.Labour, the conservative partyMrCorbyn posesasa radical butisthe mostconservative—andthe mostdangerous—candidate ofthe lot. He wantsto take therailways, waterand postal service backinto publicownership.He would resurrectcollective pay-bargainingand raise theminimum wage to the pointwhere 60% ofyoungworkers’ sal-ariesare setbythe state. Histaxplan takesaim at high earnersand ﬁrms, who would behave in wayshiscostingsignore. Uni-versitywould be free, asitwasuntil the 1990s—a vastsubsidyforthe middle classand a blowto the poor, more ofwhomhave enrolled since tuition feeshelped create more places.On Brexit, Laboursoundssofterthan the Toriesbut itspoli-cycomesto much the same. Itwouldend free movementofpeople, preclud-ingmembership ofthe single market.MrCorbyn ismore relaxed than MrsMayaboutmigration, which mightopen the doorto a slightlybetter dealon trade. Buthislifelongopposition toglobalisation hardlymakeshim theman to negotiate one.No economicliberal, MrCorbyn doesnotmuch value per-sonal freedom either. An avowed human-rightscampaigner,he hasembraced left-wingtyrantssuch asHugo Chávez and Fi-del Castro (a “champion ofsocial justice”), who locked up op-ponentsand muzzled the press. MrCorbyn hasspenta careerclaimingto stand forthe oppressed while backingoppressors.Candidate ofnowhereThe Torieswould be much betterthan Labour. Butthey, too,would raise the drawbridge. MrsMayplansto leave the EU’ssingle market, once cherished byToriesasone ofMargaretThatcher’sgreatestachievements. Worse, she insistson cuttingnetmigration bynearlytwo-thirds. Brexitwill make this grim-lyeasier, since Britain will oﬀerfewerand worse jobs. Eventhen, she will notmeetthe targetwithoutstarvingthe econ-omyofthe skillsitneedsto prosper—somethingshe ought toknow, havingmissed itforsixyearsashome secretary.Herilliberal instinctsgo beyond hersuspicion ofgloballyfootloose “citizensofnowhere”. Like MrCorbyn she proposesnewrightsforworkers, withoutconsideringthatitwouldmake ﬁrmslesslikelyto hire them in the ﬁrstplace. She wantsto make itharderforforeign companiesto buyBritish ones.Herwoolly“industrial strategy” seemsto involve pickingfa-voured industriesand ﬁrms, aswhen unspeciﬁed “supportand assurances” were given to Nissan afterthe carmakerthreatened to leave Britain afterBrexit. She haseven adoptedLabour’s“Marxist” policyofenergy-price caps.And though she isin a diﬀerentclassfrom MrCorbyn, thereare also doubtsaboutherleadership. She wanted the electioncampaign to establish herasa “strongand stable” prime min-ister. Ithasdone the opposite. In Januarywe called her“The-resa Maybe” forherindecisiveness. Nowthe centrepiece ofhermanifesto, a plan to make the elderlypaymore forsocial care,wasreversed afterjustfourdays.

Theyare more honestthan the Toriesaboutthe need to raise taxesforpublicservices; and more sensible than Labour, spreadingthe burden ratherthan leaningonlyonhigh-earners.

Although its priceisdown from an all-time high of$2,420 on May24th, ithasmorethan doubled in justtwomonths. Anyone cleverorluckyenough to have bought$1,000 ofbitcoinsin July2010, whenthe price stood at$0.05, would nowhave a stash worth $46m.Othercryptocurrencieshave soared, too, givingthem a collec-tive marketvalue ofabout$80bn.Ascentsthissteep are rarelysustainable. More often thannot, the word “bitcoin” nowcomesattached to the word “bub-ble”. Butthe question ofwhathasdriven up the price is impor-tant. Isthisjusta speculative mania, orisitevidence thatbit-coin istakingon a more substantial role asa medium ofexchange ora store ofvalue? Putanotherway, isbitcoin like atulip, gold orthe dollar—orisitsomethingelse entirely?Startwith the case thatthisisnothingmore than a virtualtulipmania, a speculative hysteria in which a risingprice en-couragesevermore buyers, no matterwhatthe assetis. Bit-coin’srecenttrajectorycertainlyseemsmanic. Retail investorshave piled in. Manyalreadyfamiliarwith bitcoin investinghave moved on to beton alternatives, such asEthereum, and“initial coin oﬀerings” (ICOs), in which ﬁrmsissue digital to-kensoftheirown.Itlookslike a scammers’ paradise, yetunlike tulips, bitcoinshave real uses. Theynowbuyeverythingfrom pizzasto com-puters. So ifa tulip isn’tthe rightanalogue, howaboutgold?Bitcoinscertainlyseem to bearmore than a passingresem-blance. Goldbugsmistrustgovernmentsand theirmoney-printingtendencies; so too do bitcoinesseurs: no central bankisin charge ofbitcoin. Buta store ofvalue should not bouncearound asmuch asthisone does: bitcoin swungfrom morethan $1,100 in late 2013 to lessthan $200 a yearlater, beforeclimbing, in ﬁtsand starts, to itscurrentdizzying heights. Ratherthan beingjusta form ofdigital gold, bitcoin aspiresto loftiergoals: to be a meansofexchange like the euro, yen orthe dollar. Regulatorsare startingto take bitcoin seriously.Some ofthe price surge can be explained byJapan’sdecision totreatbitcoin more like anyothercurrency. Yetthe bitcoin sys-tem isoperatingatitslimitsand itsdeveloperscannot agree onhowto increase the numberofexchangesthe system is able tohandle. Asa result, a transaction nowcostsnearly$4 in feesonaverage and takesmanytedioushoursto conﬁrm. Forconve-nience, a dollarbill beatsithandsdown.Notso dottyIfbitcoin and the othercryptocurrenciesare unlike anythingelse, whatare they? The bestcomparison maybe with the in-ternetand the dotcom boom itcreated in the late 1990s. Likethe internet, cryptocurrenciesboth embodyinnovation andgive rise to more ofit. Theyare experimentsin themselves ofhowto maintain a publicdatabase (the “blockchain”) withoutanybodyin particular, a bank, say, beingin charge. Georgia, forinstance, isusingthe technologyto secure government records(see page 57). And blockchainsare platformsforfurther experi-ments. Take Ethereum, forexample. Itallowsall kinds ofpro-jects, from video gamesto online markets, to raise funds byis-suingtokens—essentiallyprivate moneythatcan be tradedand used within these projects. Although such ICOsneed to behandled with care, theycould also generate intriguing inven-tions. Fanshope thattheywill give rise to decentralised up-startstakingaim attoday’soligopolistictechnologygiants,such asAmazon and Facebook.Thismayseem like a dangerouswayto generate innova-tion. Investorscould lose theirshirts; a crash in one assetclasscould spread to others, creatingwobblesin the ﬁnancial sys-tem. Butin the case ofcryptocurrenciessuch risksseem limit-ed. Itishard to argue thatthose buyingcryptocurrencies areunaware ofthe risks. And since theyare still a fairly self-con-tained system, contagion isunlikely.Ifthere issuch a thingasa healthybubble, thisis it. To besure, regulatorsshould watch outthatcryptocurrencies do notbecome even more ofa conduitforcriminal activity, such asdrugdealing. Buttheyshould thinktwice before coming downhard, particularlyon ICOs. Beingtoo spikywould notjustpricka bubble, butalso preventa lotofthe useful innovationthatislikelyto come aboutatthe same time.7The bitcoin bubbleVirtual vertigo$ per bitcoin20131415161705001,0001,5002,0002,500Are bitcoins like tulips, gold orthe dollar—orsomething else entirely?The EconomistJune3rd2017 Leaders111ONE reason Donald Trumpinvitesacresofcommen-taryisthathe keepsthe worldguessingwhathe meansandwhere hisforeign policyis head-ing.

AsThe Economistwentto press, he wasaboutto announce America’swithdrawal from the Pariscli-mate accord—or, then again, he wasaboutto stayin the accord,demonstratingthe wise counsel ofthe globalistsin his WhiteHouse. Both, orsomethingin between, were still possible. Yet, 19 weeksinto MrTrump’spresidency, outofthe chaosand the contradiction a pattern isemerging. And itis notreas-suringforAmerica orforthe world.Berlin discordWhetherornotMrTrump endsup quittingthe Parisaccord, hewasnotwillingto supportitatthe meetingofthe G7 in Taormi-na lastmonth. In the pasthe hasdescribed the science ofcli-mate change asa “hoax” aimed atdestroyingAmerican jobs.Abandoningthe accord will delighthispolitical base,droughts, delugesand disease be damned.So, too, with NATO. Atthe summithe harangued democrat-icallies, with whom America hasupheld the international or-derforthe past70 years—afterhavingjustcelebrated autocrats,such asEgypt’sAbdel-Fattah al-Sisi, on hisvisitto Saudi Arabia(see page 50). The Europeans“owed” moneyforyearsofun-derspendingon defence and fortakingAmerican taxpayers foraride. Although he isrightto argue thatEuropean defence bud-getsneed to rise faster, MrTrump grievouslyundermined thesecurityofall NATOcountriesbyrefusingto expresssupportforthe alliance’sArticle 5, the commitmentto treatan attack onone asan attackon all.

Russia, whose threatMrTrump refusesto take seriously, will be emboldened tomake mischief.

MrsMerkellaterbacked awayfrom herremarks, which were designed foralocal audience and had been interpreted bya commentariatdetermined to read disasterinto everythingMrTrump touches(see page 37). Butthe damage wasdone. And thatisthe lesson from MrTrump’sforeign adventures.International alliancesweaken from confusion and neglect, asmuch aswilful demolition.

In 2011-15 tobacco-taxrevenuesmore thandoubled, and the share ofadultswho smoked fell from 30% to25%.

The British were wearyenough whenTheresa Maycalled a surprise general elec-tion on April 18th. Itisjusttwo yearssincethe country’spreviousgeneral election,and lessthan a yearsince the divisive refer-endum thatsawitdecide to quitthe EU; in2014 a referendum in Scotland also put thefuture ofthe United Kingdom to the vote. Amonumentallydispiritingcampaign hasonlydeepened the weariness. Tediousasitall is, though, historyisbeingmade.Brexitisthe obviousreason. Whether itisTheresa May, the Conservative incum-bent, who started from a position ofstrength buthascampaigned poorly, or Je-remyCorbyn, the left-wingLabourleader,the winnerwill be forced to reshape Brit-ain’splace in the world in highlyadversecircumstances. The nextgovernmentwillalso have to re-examine domesticpolicieson everythingfrom ﬁnancial regulation toﬁsheriesasBrussels’ writcomesto itsend. Butthere ismore. Forthe past40 yearsBritain hasbeen dominated byneoliberal-ism, a creed thatsoughtto adaptsome ofthe tenetsofclassical 19th-centuryliberal-ism to a world in which the role ofthe statehad grown much larger. Itemphasised thevirtuesofrollingbackthatstate throughprivatisation, deregulation and the reduc-tion oftaxes, particularlyon the rich; ofembracingglobalisation, particularly theglobalisation ofﬁnance; ofcontrolling in-ﬂation and balancingbudgets; and of al-lowingcreative destruction full rein. Atthiselection, forthe ﬁrsttime sincethe 1970s, thatphilosophyhasno standard-bearer. JeremyCorbyn loathed itthrough-outitsascendancy. MrsMaylaunched hermanifesto byattacking“the privilegedfew”, denouncing“rip-oﬀenergyprices”and proclaimingthat“it’stime to remem-berthe good thatgovernmentcan do.”Both MrCorbyn and MrsMayfeel likethrowbacksto timesbefore itsascendancy:MrCorbyn to the militantactivism of the1970sand MrsMayto the constrained ifcomfortable conformityofthe 1950s. Buttheirantediluvian stancesresonate. Theyappearto addressproblemsthatneoliber-alism allowed to fester, such asinequalityand social disintegration—problemswhich explain, in part, whythe countryembarked on Brexitin the ﬁrstplace. In the decadesfollowingthe secondworld war, the British political landscapewasone of“Butskellism”—a term thisnewspapercontrived from the namesR.A.Butler, a moderate Conservative, andHugh Gaitskell, a moderate Labourite, twosupposedlyopposed chancellorswho hadmuch in common. Butskellism rested onfourpillars: Keynesian demand-manage-mentdesigned to avoid slumps; a welfarestate to provide people with a combina-tion ofopportunities(though education)and security(through health care and pen-sions); consensusbetween politicians,businesses(includingmanythatwereowned bythe state) and trade unions; andan “industrial strategy” to shape the direc-tion ofthe economy. The Butskellite economygrewrapidly(though notasrapidlyasAmerica, FranceorGermanydid). The welfare state suc-ceeded in itsbasicaims—providingfreehealth care and old-age pensionsforevery-bodyand free universityeducation for thebrightest. Butbythe 1970salmosthalfofBritain’snational income wasdevoted topublicspending. Growth slowed; inﬂationsoared. In 1976 Britain became the ﬁrst ad-vanced countryto go to the IMFfora loan.Between the three-dayweeksof1974,when a miners’ strike led to electricity be-ingrationed, and the “winterofdiscon-tent” in 1979, when a range ofpublicser-viceswere paralysed byindustrial action,Butskellism passed overthe horizon. The second post-warlandscape wasthatofneoliberalism. MargaretThatcherconfronted the unionsinstead ofnegotiat-ingwith them, denounced “industrialstrategies” asnonsense and privatisedthree-quartersofBritain’sstate-ownedcompanies. She embraced globalisation,then hardlya word: capital controlswereabolished; the “BigBang” re-establishedLondon asthe world’sﬁnancial centre; andBritain led the reformsthatcreated Eu-rope’ssingle market.

Butby thelate 1980sthere wasalso a palpable senseofa cornerturned: the Cityboomed, entre-preneurssuch asRichard Branson thrived,the south-eastprospered. Ailingsocial de-mocraciessuch asSweden began to look toThatcher’sBritain asa model.TonyBlairand Gordon Brown built abroaderprogramme ofliberal modernisa-tion on thislandscape. Their“NewLa-bour” pursued constitutional reformsinwhich MrsThatcherhad had no interest,made a pointofusingthe proceedsofgrowth to compensate the losers, and em-braced the EU. AsStewartWood, a formeradviserto Gordon Brown, putsit: “One ofMargaretThatcher’sgreatachievementswasto turn a fundamentalistfaith in freemarketsinto the hallmarkofmoderate cen-trism forthe nextgeneration ofleaders.” One generation on, the landscape ischanged again. The Conservative manifes-to reintroducesideasthatMargaretThatch-erregarded asbeyond the pale: price con-trolsforenergymarkets; more councilhouses; industrial policyofthe sort thatfree-marketersreﬂexivelydenounce as“pickingwinners”. In 1942 William Bever-idge, a liberal academic, committed thegovernmentto slaying“ﬁve giantevils” inthe reportthatlaid the foundationsfor thepost-warwelfare state. MrsMay’smanifes-to evokeshisspiritbyreferringto “ﬁvegiantchallenges”: the economy, Brexit, so-cial divisions, an ageingsocietyand tech-nological change. “We do notbelieve inuntrammelled free markets,” itclaims. “Werejectthe cultofselﬁsh individualism. Weabhorsocial division, injustice, unfairnessand inequality.” AfterButskell, afterBlairManifestosare limited documents: in 1979the Conservatives’ manifesto providedhardlyan inklingofthe revolution tocome. Buttheyare still indicative. NicholasTimothy, MrsMay’sco-chiefofstaﬀandthe main authorofthe manifesto, wants toupdate the partyforthe age ofpopulismand economicstagnation. So where MrsThatcher, a formereducation secretary, of-fered opportunity, MrsMay, a formerhome secretary, oﬀerssecurity. MrsThatchersawaspirational conservatism asawayto appeal to working-classvoters.MrsMay’sprotective conservatism seeksto expand the partybase byshielding thejust-about-managingfrom global markets. Labour’smanifesto iseven more hos-tile to markets. Itwantsto take the railwaysand electricitycompaniesbackinto publicownership and give powerbackto the un-ions. Itwantsto restore the “basicprinci-ples” ofthe welfare state byabolishing thefeesforuniversitystudentsthatMrBlairbroughtin, scrappingthe private-ﬁnanceinitiative with which MrBrown wasmuchtaken and removingall internal marketsfrom the National Health Service (NHS). The manifesto would have been redderyetin tooth and clawifMrCorbyn had hadhisway. The MPforIslington North isargu-ablythe mostleft-wingleaderthe partyhashad. He iscertainlymore left-wingthan Michael Foot, the leaderin 1980-83,who neverhad anytruckwith Marxism.MrCorbyn deﬁed hisparty’swhip 428timesunderMrBlairand MrBrown, op-posing, amongotherthings, private-ﬁ-nance forthe NHS, anti-terroristlegislationand the invasion ofIraq. Hisinnercircle iseven more hard-line. John McDonnell, hisshadowchancellor, isan admirernotonlyofMarxbutalso ofLenin and Trotsky. Abandoned bythe two main parties,neoliberalism hasno redoubtelsewhere.Afteryearsin which itlooked asifBritain’stwo-partysystem wasfragmenting, thingshave gone into reverse. The two main par-tiescurrentlyhave a combined share of80% ofthe polls, compared with just67% inthe 2015 election. The Liberal Democratshave paid forthe neoliberal enthusiasmthattookthem into coalition with DavidCameron’sConservativesin 2010; havingboasted 57 MPsthen, theynowhave justeight. Theyare unlikelyto add manyonJune 8th (see chart2 on nextpage), despitetheirsbeingthe onlypartypromising to tryto soften Brexitand to oﬀerthe possibilityofrejectingit. Unforced errorsItwould be wrongto see onlyan ideologi-cal shiftatplayhere; political misjudg-mentsplayed a bigpartin gettingBritain toitscurrentimpasse. When, havinglosttheelection, Ed Miliband stepped down as La-bourleaderin 2015, all candidatesto suc-ceed him needed nominationsfrom 15% ormore ofthe parliamentaryparty. MrCor-byn would nothave been able to sur-mountthatbarrierhad itnotbeen forsome centre-rightMPsfeelingthat, thoughhe had no hope ofwinning, hiscandidacywould broaden the debate. MargaretBeck-ett, previouslya caretakerleaderof theparty, said thatshe nominated him “so thatthe leftwould have some representation”.Given thisopportunity, MrCorbynwon the heartsand votesofa majority ofthe party’smembersaswell asoftensofthousandsofnew“supporters” who,thanksto a rule change MrMiliband hadfavoured, were allowed to vote in the lead-ership election provided theycontributed£3 ($4) to partycoﬀers. When hisleader-ship waschallenged afterthe Brexitrefer-endum MrCorbyn could no longergeteven 15% ofthe party’sMPsto nominatehim. Butthe courtsruled thatthisdid notpreclude hisrunning, and he won again.He thusheld on to the leadership ofhispartydespite the factthatthree-quarters ofhiscolleaguesin Parliamentthinkthat he isunﬁtforthe job and manyleadingMPsre-fuse to serve in hisshadowcabinet.

Euroscepticrankswere thickwith whatMrCameron described as“swivel-eyed” lunatics. The campaign proved MrCameron’sassessmentwrong. Havingearliersaid hewould be happyto leave the EUifitwerenotreformed,hisclaimsthatBritain had toremain ranghollow. MrCorbyn, who likemostofthe Labourlefthasbeen deeply Eu-roscepticin histime, campaigned for Re-main with lessvigourthan anyotherLa-bourleadersince Michael Footwouldhave. Agroup ofcannyactivistsled byDouglasCarswell, Daniel Hannan and Do-minicCummingsseized control oftheLeave campaign and soughtto marginaliseboth UKIP’sNigel Farage—whose anti-im-migrantpopulism turned manyvotersoﬀ,butwhose supporterswould vote Leaveregardless—and old-school ToryEuro-scepticslike John Redwood. Instead theykeptthe focuson more plausible voicessuch asthose ofBorisJohnson and Mi-chael Gove. MrHannan arguesthat, hadDowningStreetbeen able to frame the de-bate asa choice between MrCameron andMrFarage, MrCameron would have wonata walk. Instead he lost. In a way, though, he succeeded in hisoriginal aim. The Torieshad been split overEurope since the mid-1980s; the divisionhelped topple MrsThatcher, hobbled hersuccessor, John Major, and weakened op-position to NewLabour. Nowthe breach ismended: the Euroscepticswon. And thishasprovided an electoral bonus. Torieswho abandoned the partyforUKIPcannowreturn—and Labourvoterswho wentforUKIP, orvoted Leave in the referendum,seem winnable, too (see chart3). The To-rieshave calculated thatiftheycould add80% ofthe votesUKIP gotin 2015 to theirown tallyfrom thatyear, theirworking ma-jorityin Parliament, currently17 seats,would be over100. Theyhave campaignedvigorouslyin Labourstrongholdsin theMidlandsand the North thatvoted forBrexit: MrsMaylaunched hermanifesto inthe Yorkshire town ofHalifax, where 56%voted Leave and Labour’spaliamentarymajorityisunder1,000. The darkness drops againThe appearance ofMrCorbyn’sname onlabour’sleadership ballotallowed thou-sandsofangrypeople to vote fora leaderwho broke with the past. MrCameron’sdecision to hold a referendum allowedmillionsofpeople to expresstheirfrustra-tion with the statusquo. And these angrydecisionshave proved to be mutuallyrein-forcing. MrsMay’sdecision to accepttheresultofthe Brexitvote hasproduced a de-ﬁnitivelypost-Cameron Conservativeparty; the onlyToryvoice ofnoteraisedagainstheristhatofGeorge Osborne, oncean impeccablyneoliberal chancellor, nowthe editorofLondon’slocal paper, the Eve-ningStandard. MrCorbyn’srelativelysuc-cessful campaign hasdemonstrated thatespousingsocialistopinionsisnotneces-sarilythe kissofdeath. The angerthatturned those mistakesinto a seismicshiftisitselfgrounded in thefailuresofneoliberalism. The biggest factorwasthe 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis. It hitBritain particularlyhard because ﬁnancialservicesplayan outsized role in the coun-try’seconomy, generating8% ofitsGDP,and because ofits“lighttouch” regulation.The crisismade Britonssigniﬁcantlypoorer: British workerssawtheirwages(adjusted forinﬂation) fall by10% in2008-14, and are unlikelyto see them reachpre-crisislevelsuntil atleast2020. Itplayedhavocwith the publicﬁnances: faced withlarge deﬁcitsthe coalition governmentchose to cutbackon publicspending.The crisisalso undermined the public’sfaith in theirrulers. Thatfaith had alreadytaken some knocks. MrBlair’sdecision tobackGeorge Bush in removingSaddamHussein from powerin 2003 ended up do-ingmuch to discredithim, especially in theeyesofhisown party. The onlyLabourprime ministereverto win three electionsin a rowbecame a pariah in hisown coun-try. More parochially, in 2009 the DailyTelegraphrevealed thatMPsroutinelyabused theirexpensesto do up homesthattheysold on ata proﬁt, aswell asfor sun-dryotherill-judged and absurd outlayssuch asthe renovation ofmoatsand thehousingofducks. Sixcabinetministers re-signed, several MPsended up in prisonand the political classwastarnishedButthe ﬁnancial crisisdid notjust en-trench distrustand anger. Italso laid barelonger-term problemsin the economy. Brit-ain’sﬂexible labourmarkethasbeen goodatgeneratingjobs. Thatisone reason theadmission ofeastern European countriessuch asPoland to the EUled to a surge inimmigrantsin the mid-2000s, one thatNewLabourwelcomed; concernsovertheirpresence wasone ofthe factors thatdelivered a Leave vote atthe referendum.Butdespite the inﬂux, the unemploymentrate isone ofthe lowestin Europe.Ifthe neoliberal dispensation was goodatproducingjobs, though, itwasno greathelp in guaranteeingtheirquality. Almostamillion Britonsare on “zero-hours” con-tractsthatprovide no assured revenue, upfrom 108,000 in 2004. Britonsworklongerhoursthan theirFrench and German coun-terparts, and, in the south-east, spendmore time and more moneygettingtowork.

Italso dividesopinion on classlines: richerBritonsare more likely to re-gard immigration asa good thing; poorerBritonsto see them ascompetitorsfor jobsand state resources. Thatdivision wasmade more poison-ousbythe factthatthe elite did very well inthe neoliberal years. In 1980 the averageCEO ofa companyon the FTSEAll Share in-dexearned 25 timesmore than the averageemployee. In 2016 the bossesearned 130timesmore. Between 2000 and 2008 theindexfell by30% butthe payforthe CEOsrunningthe ﬁrmson the indexrose by 80%. Privatisation hasfed resentmenttoo.Labour’spromise to re-nationalise the rail-ways, which would have been unthink-able ten yearsago, ispopulartoday: thankhigh faresand private proﬁt.The bitsofthepublicsectorthatstayed publicdid prettywell bytheiroverseers, too. MarkThomp-son, then the director-general ofthe BBC,sawhispaysoarfrom £609,000 in 2005-06to £788,000 the nextyearand £834,000 theyearafterthat. The average payofa univer-sityvice-chancellorisnowmore than aquarterofa million pounds. ManyBritishpoliticiansalso did verywell, and not justthrough theirexpenses. Politicianssuch asMrBlair, PeterMandelson and MrOsbornehave made millionsbyoﬀeringadvice tobanks, makingspeechesand otherwisetransformingthemselvesfrom gamekeep-ersinto poachers. MrCarswell, who havingleftﬁrst theConservativesand then UKIPisnowretir-ingfrom Parliament, goestoo farwhen hesaysthatthe problem with today’sneolib-eralsisthatthey“are on the side ofDavosMan, notthe demos”. Successive politi-cianshave made seriousattemptsto ad-dressBritain’sover-centralisation, for ex-ample. MrBlairand MrBrown allowedScotland and Walesto vote on devolution.MrCameron and MrOsborne created sixpowerful regional mayors, includingonesforBritain’ssecond and third cities, Bir-mingham and Manchester. Butthisreturnofcontrol to the people hasproved insuﬃ-cient. Manywanted more, and believedthatbyvotingto leave the EUtheywouldgetit, particularlywhen itcame to bordersand immigration. In doingso theychangedthingsprofoundly. Apoorgovernmentcanbe voted out. Misguided plebiscitesare notso easilyreversed. Whetherthatattemptto seize controlleadsto the creation ofa plausible new po-litical landscape, notjustthe levelling ofthe old one, dependsto some extenton theresultofthe election. Adevastating defeatforMrCorbyn mightallowmoderate La-bourMPsto reassertcontrol overthe party,sparkinga centristrevival. Abigwin forMrsMaymightallowherto negotiate asofterBrexitthan Euroscepticslike MrRed-wood wantto see. Butneitheristhat likely. Slouching towards MaidenheadThe main opposition to the leftin the La-bourPartycomesfrom the old right, led byTom Watson, MrCorbyn’sdeputy, notfrom Blairites; the righthascontempt forMrCorbyn because ofhishaveringon theIRAand Hamasand hislonghistoryof re-bellion, notbecause he seeksto national-ise industries. MrsMay, neithereasy toread norveryresolute, mightjustas likelyuse a bigvictoryasproofthatshe has pub-licsupportto negotiate the hardestof Brex-its. Alternatively, the weaknessshe hasshown in the campaign mightyetsee herdeposed ifcolleaguesdecide the negotia-tionsare goingin the wrongdirection. Beyond this, there are three reasons forthinkingthatitwill be veryhard to fashionanewpolitical landscape eitherquickly orwell. The ﬁrstisa lackofpreparatoryspadework. Beveridge published hisout-line ofthe welfare state in 1942; Thatcheritethink-tanksbusied themselvesdraftingblueprintsforprivatisation throughout the1970s. Today’spopulistconservatism looksamateurish and improvised: MrTimothyplunged the Torycampaign into chaosbyaddingan ill-thought-outmeasure to ob-lige elderlypeople to payfortheirsocialcare withoutputtinga cap on the amountthattheywould spend. Labour’smanifes-to isa compromise between whatMrMili-band oﬀered two yearsago and whatMrCorbyn wants, with a profusion ofspeciﬁcproposalsthatseeksto distractfrom itsfun-damental ﬂaws. The second isthatthe populistwavehasbroken badlyforBritain. In the post-warera, and again in the 1980s, Britain wasin the forefrontofa worldwide revolution.The Beveridge reportwastranslated into 22languages(two German copiesdroppedbythe RAFwere found in Hitler’sbunker).MrsThatcher’sagenda ofderegulation andprivatisation found imitatorsacrosstheworld: between 1985 and 2000 westernEuropean governmentssold oﬀsome$100bn-worth ofstate assets. TodayBritain isouton a limb. DonaldTrump, the onlymajorﬁgure overseas tohave exalted in the Brexitresult, is erratic,crisis-prone and toxic. Emmanuel Macronwon the French presidencybypromisingto embrace a Blairite mixture ofliberal re-forms, includingderegulation, and cosmo-politanism. Angela Merkel looksasif she isgoingto win a third term easily. Some Con-servativeshave argued thatMrsMayistamingthe populistrevolution byco-opt-ingit; in fact, she mayend up hostage to arevolution alreadyin retreat. The third isBrexititself. Negotiating itislikelyto prove all-consuming; policymak-erswill have no energyleftoverfor seriousattemptsto tackle problemssuch aspoorproductivitygrowth. And all the whileBrexitwill be hurtingthe economy. EvenBrexiteersconcede thatBritain will suﬀershort-term shocksasitrenegotiatesits rela-tionship with itssingle biggestmarket.Mostindependentexpertspredictlong-term harm aswell. Accordingto the mostrecentestimatesfrom the Centre forEco-nomicPerformance atthe London SchoolofEconomics, a hard Brexitwould reduceGDPperhead by2.6% overten years, whileasofterSwiss- orNorwegian-style Brexitwould cutitby1.3%.The resultislikelyto be a partial repriseofthe 1970s. Politicswill be paralysed—thistime bynegotiatingBrexitratherthanﬁghtswith unions. The economywill stag-nate thanksto a mixture ofuncertaintyand businessﬂight. Publicserviceswill besqueezed. The roilingdiscontentthat pro-duced Brexitwill ﬁnd newtargets. In the1970s, though, Britain edged itswayto-wardssolvingthe problemsofitsformerdispensation. Itismuch harderto see itdo-ingthe same thistime round. 7Really?The EconomistJune3rd201719For daily analysis and debate on Asia, visitEconomist.com/asia1INTHE dead ofnightworkersprised thestatue oﬀitsbase, raised itonto the backofa truckand hauled itaway.

Let’scopySingapore’shealth-caremiracle,” chirped an opinion piece on the website ofFoxNews, aconservative American broadcaster, soon afterthe election ofDonald Trump. Itargued thatthe “miracle” rested on two featuresdearto Republican hearts—“empoweringconsumersand foster-ingcompetition”. Some ofthe more vocal Brexiteersdream ofturningBritain into “Singapore-on-Thames”: a low-tax, lightlyregulated haven forbusinesseseagerto trade with Europe. Likethe proverbial blind men describingan elephantbyfeeling justone partofthe beast, each ofthese admirersgetssomething rightaboutSingapore, butall missthe bigpicture.Startwith the Brexiteers. Britain’s65m people are almost12timesasnumerous, and are scattered overa territory337 timeslargerthan Singapore’s. Britain isalreadylightlytaxed and regu-lated byEuropean standards, butcompared with Singapore itis abehemoth. Britain’stop rate ofincome tax, now45%, isdoublethatofSingapore; and itsgovernmentaccountsforabout 38% ofGDP, abouttwice asmuch asthe lean Singaporean one. Shrink-ingthe British state much furtherwould mean slashingspendingand radicallyreshapingthe National Health Service. Voterswould punish anypartythatattempted such a thing.Even assumingthe EU were to give low-taxBritain easy accessto itssingle market, the neighbourhood iscompletelydiﬀerent.South-EastAsia isa boomingregion of630m people, manyofwhom live in countriesthatare unstable, corruptorhave lousyinfrastructure. EﬃcientSingapore givesﬁrmseasyaccess to thoseconsumerswhile minimisingrisks. Europe, bycontrast, may bestagnantbut, populistthreatsnotwithstanding, ispolitically sta-ble and mostlywell governed. Itmakeslesssense fora companyto setup in Britain to sell to Spaniardsthan foritto base itselfinSingapore to caterto Indonesians—and treblyso ifBritain losesunrestricted accessto Europe, asitprobablywill after Brexit.American conservatives, fortheirpart, are rightthat Singa-pore’shealth-care system achievesﬁne resultsbyemphasisingpersonal responsibility, competition and lowpublicspending.Singaporeanspayformuch oftheirhealth care outoftheir ownpocketsand enjoyamongthe world’shighestlife expectanciesand lowestinfant-mortalityrates. The countryspendsjust 5% ofGDP on health care, ofwhich about2% ofGDP comesfrom thepublicpurse. America spendsmuch more, 17% and 8% ofGDP re-spectively, yetitspopulation ismuch lesshealthy. However, Singapore’ssystem also featuresfarmore coercionand governmentintervention than Americanswould plausiblyaccept. Mosthospitalsare state-run. Mosthospicesand nursinghomesare private butgovernment-funded. The governmentheavilysubsidisesacute care. Itpromotescompetition by pub-lishinghospital bills; American health-care providers, bycon-trast, make theirpricesasopaque aspossible to discourage shop-pingaround. The governmentcompelsSingaporeansto divert upto 10.5% oftheirwagesinto “Medisave” accounts(employerscon-tribute, too). Italso subsidises“cost-eﬀective and essential” drugs;unapproved drugs, ifavailable, can be prohibitivelyexpensive.Both the leftand the rightwill ﬁnd much to like about Singa-pore’shealth-care system. Butanyone who thoughtthatMichelleObama urgingchildren to eatmore appleswastoo nannyish willﬁnd ithard to stomach.AsKishore Mahbubani ofthe Lee KuanYewSchool ofPublicPolicyputsit: “The ideologyguidingLeeKuan YewwasnotAyn Rand.”Asimilarpattern—personal responsibilitysupported by coer-cion and a lean butrobustsafetynet—appliesacrossSingapore’seconomy. More than 90% ofSingaporeansown theirown homes,butmostare government-builtﬂatsboughtatgovernment-setprices, often with government-provided grants. Where Singapor-eanscan live dependsin parton theirethnicity: to avoid racialghettos, Singapore requiresthe composition ofpublic-housingblocksto reﬂectthe country’sracial make-up.Hard bargainSuch social engineeringwould appal Western votersand bestruckdown byWestern courts. YetSingaporeansacceptit. Pater-nalism hasenforced racial calm. The country’sChinese majorityhasbeen spared the atrocitiesvisited on the Chinese diaspora in,say, Malaysia and Indonesia. More important, the trade-oﬀ thatLee Kuan Yewoﬀered still holds: illiberal politicsin exchange forgood governmentand high livingstandards. Singapore’sleadersvigorouslydefend theirreputations withdefamation suits, and gerrymanderconstituenciesto help pre-serve the rulingparty’smajority. Buttheydeliversafe streets, ﬁrst-rate health care, good publictransportand a clean, responsivepublicadministration.

In astatementMrRinaldi issued shortlyafter-wards, he conﬁrmed thathe told MrNevá-rezhe would shoothim, albeitonlyin self-defence, afterMrNevárezthreatened to“gethim”. He had, he added, soughtpoliceprotection. Whatisbeyond dispute isthatthethreatwasissued duringthe course of ascuﬄe thatbroke outon the ﬂoorof theTexasHouse. MrRinaldi overheard twootherDemocraticlegislators, CésarBlancoand Ramon Romero, commendingprotes-terswho had gathered in the chamber’spublicgallery, in opposition to a new statelawcrackingdown on “sanctuary” poli-ciesin Texascitiesand counties. “Fuckthem,” said MrRinaldi, ofthe protesters.He had, he added, called in the immigra-tion authoritiesto deportthem.The lawin question wasthe product ofone ofthe more notable legislative debatesofthe year.

Michael Flynn,brieﬂyDonald Trump’snational-securityadviser, seemsto have forgotten that heand MrKislyakdiscussed American sanc-tions, and paid with hisjob. Meanwhile Ja-red Kushner, the president’sson-in-law,omitted hisown meetingwith the ambas-sadoratTrump Towerfrom hissecurity-clearance form. Nowthe alleged substanceoftheirconversation hasbroughtfresh em-barrassmentto MrKushnerand MrTrump.On May26th the Washington Postre-ported that, in hisencounterwith Mr Kis-lyakin December, MrKushnerproposedestablishinga back-channel between MrTrump’steam and the Kremlin. Accordingto the Post, MrKushnersuggested usingequipmentin Russian diplomaticfacilitiesforthese secretchats, presumablyto con-ceal them from BarackObama’soutgoingadministration. The proposal reportedlycame to lightthrough the interception ofMrKislyak’sown communicationswithhiscolleaguesin Moscow.Itseemsto have come to nothing. But, atatime when Russian meddlingin the elec-tion wascausingan uproar, whatmight MrKushnerhave been thinking? MrFlynnwasatthe meeting, too, and one apparentaim wasto connecthim with Russian secu-ritypersonnel, expeditingMrTrump’sfan-ciful plan to co-ordinate the two countries’eﬀortsin Syria. In MrKushner’sdefence,some American oﬃcialshave maintainedthatsuch back-channelsare routine. Forhispart, MrTrump—who made a diﬀerentkind ofslip-up with MrKislyak, when herevealed classiﬁed intelligence to the am-bassadoron May10th—again tweeted de-nunciationsofmedia “lies”.Butgiven the variousinquiries, in theFBIand Congress, into possible collusionbetween the Trump campaign and the Rus-sians, speculation aboutMrKushner’smo-tivesisinevitable. Itdoesn’thelp thatMrKislyakwasnotthe onlyRussian he met inDecember: MrKushneralso sawSergeyGorkovofVnesheconombank, a state-owned bankplaced undersanctionsbyMrObama.

Still, assumingthe Post’sre-portistrue, one safe conclusion isthat MrKushnerunderestimated the importofhisscheme. Diplomacy—particularlywith theKremlin—isturningoutto be trickier thanMrTrump and hisassociatesexpected. Meanwhile the “witch hunt”, asthepresidenttermsthe variousRussia probes,hasfresh impetusand istouchingtheWhite House itself.

The grossenrolmentrate, meaningthe proportion of18- to 24-year-oldsinhighereducation, surged from 21% in2000 to 43% in 2013, a fasterexpansionthan in anyotherregion in thisperiod, ac-cordingto a newreportfrom the WorldBank. Manyofthe newstudentsare, likeMrHuamán, from hard-up families.While studentsfrom the poorerhalf ofthe population accounted for16% ofthetotal in 2000, in 2012 theymade up 24% ofthe (bigger) total—an increase of3m stu-dentsfrom such backgrounds.To meetthisdemand, since the early2000ssome 2,300 newuniversitiesor in-stitutesoﬀeringdiploma coursesopenedin the region. Manyofthem are private,and do notsetan entrance exam. (Lessthan halfofstudentsare nowatpublic in-stitutions.) Thishuge expansion is a signofrapid socio-economicprogressin LatinAmerica. Itisthe resultoffaster economicgrowth, the spread ofsecondaryeduca-tion and the aspirationsofan emerginglower-middle class. Itisa welcomechange in a region with a bigshortage ofskilled labour. In Latin America, only 14%ofthe workforce hasa higher-educationdiploma, accordingto María Marta Fer-reyra, the lead authorofthe bank’sreport.In the United Statesthe ﬁgure is42%.Butthere isa catch. Almosthalf ofthosewho enroll in universitiesdrop outwith-outgettinga degree, MsFerreyra warns.And some ofthose who graduate will ﬁndthattheircourse wasa waste ofmoney, inthatthe extra salarytheymightcommandwill notcompensate forthe costofthe de-gree and the income forgone while study-ing. Studentsfrom poorerbackgrounds aremore likelythan othersto drop out. Nei-therthe publicsecondaryschoolsthattheyattend northeirparents, who oftenhave little more than primaryschooling,prepare them forthe academicchallengeofuniversity.Afterthe headlongexpansion, LatinAmerica needsto rethinkpolicieson high-ereducation, especiallybecause the re-gion’seconomicslowdown isforcingsome governmentsto curb spending. Theﬁrstproblem isa lackofinformation aboutwhich coursesatwhich universitiesareworthwhile. The region hastoo manystu-dentsoflawand social science, and notenough engineersand scientists. Many ofthe newerinstitutionsoﬀera poor-qualityeducation. And the average degree courselastsforﬁve years—an encouragement todrop out.The second issue iswhetherpublicfundsare beingused eﬀectively. Govern-mentshave expanded studentgrantsandlow-interestloans. Butthese can have un-intended consequences. Free (ie, taxpay-er-funded) universitytuition, asChile’spresident, Michelle Bachelet, proposes,can ease the pressure on studentsto com-plete theirdegreeswhile beinga gift to thebetter-oﬀ. In Brazil there isevidence thatstudentloanshave had the eﬀectof push-ingup tuition feesatfor-proﬁtuniversi-ties. Peruand Colombia have both intro-duced schemesaimed atstudentswhoare both hard-up and clever, which lookto be a more eﬀective use ofpublic mon-ey. Mentoringand help with preparing foruniversitycould increase the chances thatpoorstudentsgraduate. Properevaluation and oversightofuniversitiesiscrucial, too. There hasbeensome timid progressin this. Chile shutdown Universidad del Mar, a large, shod-dilymanaged institution with murky ﬁ-nances. Peruhasclosed several substan-dard teacher-traininginstitutes. Above all,Latin America needsto oﬀermore varietyto itsschool leavers. Manyofthose at-tendingbad universitiesmightbe betterserved byexpanded and improved voca-tional training. Forpeople like MrHuamán, studyingatuniversityrepresentsa riskybet. Manyfamilieshave gone into debtto ﬁnancetheirchildren’sstudies. Ifuniversities donotoﬀera betterand more predictable re-turn, thatisa formula forsocial discon-tent. Chile hasalreadyseen yearsof stu-dentprotestsoverthe high costofstudying.

Amongthem were threeanti-abortion social conservatives, a liber-tarian and a Trumpian populist. Anyoneofthese mighthave unravelled MrHar-per’scoalition.

MrScheershareshispredecessor’senthusiasm forsmallergovernmentandlowertaxes. Like MrHarperhe opposescarbon taxesand emphasisesthe need togo after“radical Islamicterrorists”. The me-dia dubbed him “Harperlite”. He prefers“Harper2.0”. NowJustin Trudeau, the Lib-eral who defeated MrHarperto becomeprime minister, will face a dulyelectedleaderofthe opposition forthe ﬁrst time. The race wasclose. MrScheerwon50.95% ofthe vote after13 roundsofcount-ing. (Abouthalfthe party’smembersvot-ed, listingcandidatesin theirorder ofpref-erence; those who backed the leastpopularcandidatesin each round hadtheirnextpreferencescounted.)

Conservativesfrom western, energy-producingprov-inces, like MrScheerand MrHarper, tendto oppose costlyaction to reduce emis-sionsofgreenhouse gases. MrScheerpromised in hisvictoryspeech to repealthe “job-killingcarbon tax” thatthe Liberalgovernmentplansto impose on provincesthatdo notputa price on carbon. MichaelChong, the one candidate forthe leader-ship to supporta carbon tax, wasbooed forthisduringa pre-election debate. AlexKwong, a youngConservative delegatefrom Toronto, lamented thatin rejectingsuch measuresthe partywasdistancing it-selffrom millennial voters. ProgressiveConservatives, one ofthe tendenciesMrHarperbroughtinto hisbig-tentparty, hadmade the environment“ourissue”, hesaid. The Liberals“tookitawayfrom us”. MrScheer’ssupportersare counting onhischarm to infuse Harperism with newlife. “Justin Trudeauisa likeable kind ofguy, and we need somebodywho hasagood personality,” said Katherine Feder-kiewicz, a Conservative delegate atthe To-ronto convention. MrScheerhasmorethan two yearsto woo Canadians: the nextelection isin October2019. He will needthattime. Arecentpoll byNanosshowssupportforthe Conservativesat29%—11pointsbehind the Liberals.

Asthe siege tightened, itsdairyfarmersslowlylostaccessto theircustom-ersin the capital. With the ensuingmilkglutin the enclave, pricescollapsed.Usinghiscontacts, MrManfoush, whoowned a small cheese business, struck adeal with the regime. He began to bringcheap milkfrom rebel territoryin EasternGhouta to regime-held Damascus, wherehe could sell itfordouble the price. The re-gime received a cutofthe proﬁt. Mr Man-foush reinvested hisshare. He snapped upthe region’sbestcowsand dairymachin-eryfrom farmersand businessmen whoselivelihoodshad been hammered bythesiege. Asthe businessevolved, the trucksthatleftGhouta with milkand cheesecame backladen with the barleyandwheathe needed to feed hisgrowingdairyherd there and run the bakerieshe bought.Asthe onlytraderallowed to bringgoodsin and outofSyria’slargestbesiegedarea, MrManfoush could control prices.When these peaked in the winterof2013,asthe regime tightened the siege after kill-ing1,400 people in a sarin gasattack, MrManfoush wascharging$19 fora kilo ofsugar(in Damascusthe same amountcostlessthan $1). With a captive marketof390,000 people and the sole rightto im-portfood, fuel, medicine and otherneces-sities, MrManfoush’sproﬁts—and those ofhispatronsin the regime—rocketed.

Even with such competition,the checkpointthrough which MrMan-foush trucked hisgoodsbecame known asthe “Million Crossing”. Residentsbelieve itgenerates$5,000 perhourin bribesfor thesoldierswho man it. Foreign aid furtherboosted MrMan-foush’sproﬁts. Organisationsfunding bak-eriesand local councilswere forced to relyon him to transferhard currencyinto East-ern Ghouta. Thisin turn generated evenmore moneyforthe cheese king, who ben-eﬁted from the diﬀerentexchange rates in-side and outside the rebel enclave.EstimatesofMrManfoush’swealthvary. Whatisknown isthatthe cheesetradercan aﬀord to keep a private militia ofabout500 men and a workforce ofaround1,500 who are paid asmuch as$250 permonth—more than rebel commanderspaytheirﬁghters. He hasboughtup property inDamascusand hisfactoriesinside the re-bel enclave churn outdairyproducts,crisps, canned goodsand juice.Aside from itscut, the regime has alsowon a degree ofquietfrom MrManfoush’spartofEastern Ghouta. “People see him asasortofRobin Hood character.

He suggeststhatMrKurzismore im-age than substance, and doubtswhetherhe can escape the old ÖVPstructures.

Hisdescription ofRocard asa “rare blend” ofa statesman anda“convinced, extremelyfree and commit-ted” politician sounded like a model forhimself. MrMacron metRocard shortlyaftergraduatingfrom the prestigious EcoleNationale d’Administration (ENA). Theybecame close; Rocard wasa guestatMrMacron’swedding. Afterhisdeath, MrMacron vowed to continue hislegacy.Both men were educated atENA, asismuch ofthe French elite. Like Rocard in histime, MrMacron arguesthatpoliticsneedsto overcome old ideological and partisandivides; he builthispolitical movement,originallycalled En Marche! (“On theMove!”) and since redubbed La Répu-blique en Marche! (LRM), to thatend. As aconsensus-seekingprime minister, in1988-91, Rocard governed withouta major-ity, and repeatedlysoughtthe backing ofthe centre-rightto passlegislation.

Piles of plastic bottles and other debris collected by a brigade of volunteers dotted the sand: mementoes from the shores of Bali, Indonesia’s once pristine holiday island.Clean-ups like these highlight the deluge of man-made waste finding its way into the ocean and washing up on coasts worldwide, and the Sisyphean task ahead. Plastic waste has become a totem for the ocean’s ills. Climate change, overfishing, pollution and accelerating economic activity each add stresses to already troubled seas. Their cumulative impact is proving to be profound.The challenge is large and the task is urgent, but there is a palpable sense that solutions are within reach. Karmenu Vella, European commissioner for maritime affairs, summed up the mood at the recent World Ocean Summit: “The oceans present a huge environmental responsibility, but also a huge economic opportunity.”CHARTING A NEW COURSEIn June, the United Nations’ 193 member states will meet in New York to discuss the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14), to “conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources”. In October, the European Commission will host the Our Ocean event in Malta, taking the reins from John Kerry, former United States secretary of state and the driving force behind the initiative. Towards the end of the year in Bonn, the COP23 climate-change deliberations will offer another opportunity to reinforce the importance of the ocean to the climate, and to underscore the need to map out more comprehensive responses to climate change.At the World Ocean Summit, Piyush Bhargava, vice-president of global operations at Dell, announced his company’s plans to reduce plastic waste in packaging. Brian Sullivan, programme manager of Google Ocean and Earth Outreach, committed to host any data on fisheries, shipping or other sources that could help address large-scale ocean issues, and to make them publicly available. Matching private-sector commitments, the United Nations Environment Programme launched a global plastic-waste initiative. Ten countries have already joined, including Indonesia, which promised to slash its marine litter by 70% by 2025. The Global Mangrove Alliance, a coalition of three of the world’s largest conservation groups (Conservation International, the Nature Conservancy and WWF) pledged to restore 20% of the world’s mangrove habitats by 2030. Bloomberg Philanthropies announced it would develop a list of the 50 most critical coral reefs to protect. “These are tangible commitments of accountability and are moments to be applauded,” said Peter Thompson, president of the UN General Assembly.

Though goodwill towards the ocean appears to be increasing, the scale of the practical challenge is large. A major hurdle, and a focal point of the World Ocean Summit, is the enormous need for capital in developing a more sustainable ocean economy. There is a need for finance so that traditional ocean-related industries, such as shipping and oil and gas, can transition to more sustainable practices. The development of “blue” industries, such as offshore renewables, sustainable aquaculture and marine biotechnology, needs funding too. Innovative vehicles for investing sustainably in the ocean are emerging, but the global green-finance explosion has yet to turn blue. Sustainable ocean investments often lack precedents and clear risk profiles, and mainstream investors are either wary of them or unaware of the pitfalls.Yet, with the right incentives in place, the business opportunities could be significant. Tackling overfishing by ensuring fish stocks are sustainably managed could unlock economic benefits of up to $83 billion a year, according to the World Bank.Demonstration projects, such as the winner of the 2017 Ocean Innovation Challenge, play a vital role in providing the market with enough confidence to unlock private capital. The Seychelles aims to raise $15m through a blue bond to finance the implementation of a sustainable fisheries-management plan off the country’s Mahé Plateau. The debt financing is part of a wider National Blue Economy Roadmap, which includes another innovative financing mechanism—a sovereign-debt swap for conservation and climate adaptation.Still, sustainable financing for the ocean is in its infancy. ‘‘The oceans movement seems to be where the green or clean-energy movement was 20 years ago, when policy was in initial formation and there were the beginnings of markets forming,” said Michael Eckhart, managing director and head of environmental finance at Citigroup. Green bonds started small but now cover more than $100 billion in debt, suggesting that there is still room for the blue versions to grow. For this to happen, better risk assessment and stress-testing for emerging investment opportunities will need to be in place, including new guidelines to help investors evaluate whether sustainability criteria can be met. And unless governance improves, most conservation financing in particular will continue to come from philanthropy and public-private partnerships, warned Mark Burrows, former  managing director and vice-chairman of global investment banking and capital markets at Credit Suisse. Mainstream capital will stay on the sidelines.COP THATIncreasing evidence of climate change in the ocean and on coastlines requires that the ocean be brought into formal climate-change agreements with greater urgency. Risks include rising sea levels and bigger storm surges, which will affect coastal infrastructure and human settlements; a warming ocean; geographical shifts in fish stocks; and the wholesale bleaching of coral reefs. Advocates hope the upcoming COP23 negotiations will see swifter and more ambitious action, but a chillier global policy environment could curb the building momentum.Appreciation of climate change–related risks to investments in the ocean and along coasts is woefully inadequate, the tools to assess such risks undeveloped, and the appetite only just beginning to surface. The G20-mandated Financial Stability Board task-force on disclosing climate change–related risk could offer a way forward, but there is a need for a comprehensive method ADVERTISEMENT“If you can teach children not to throw plastic waste into rivers and seas, they will teach their parents.” Patrick ThomasChairman and chief executive officerCovestro “There are lots of commitments,  but no consequences.”  Susi PudjiastutiMinister of maritime affairs and fisheriesIndonesia and mechanism for evaluating the viability of existing and future investments in the ocean.LOOKING FORWARD: THE WORLD OCEAN INITIATIVESince 2012 the World Ocean Summit has sought to bridge the sometimes dissonant perspectives of business, government and civil society on how we use our troubled seas. The vision is of an ocean in robust health and with a vital economy; the purpose to accelerate the transition to using the ocean sustainably. In 2018, the World Ocean Summit will expand into a wider, more ambitious World Ocean Initiative. The aim is to inﬂ uence progress in several areas: ocean ﬁ nance, ocean governance, pollution, sustainable seafood, and climate change. The ﬁ fth summit, in Mexico in March 2018, will deliver, stress-test and review the year’s work and goals, and look forward with new ideas and objectives.

P. Harish, ofMcGill University. Theystudied howoften European rulerswentto warbe-tween 1480 and 1913. Over193 reigns, theyfound thatstatesruled byqueenswere27% more likelyto wage warthan thoseruled bykings. Thiswasnotall the queens’ fault:men, seeingthem assofttargets, tendedto attackthem. AfterMaryTudorbecamequeen ofEngland in 1553, the ProtestantreformerJohn Knoxdeclared “the Mon-strousRegimentofWomen” unﬁtto rule:“nature...doth paintthem forth to beweak, frail, impatient, feeble, and fool-ish.” Echoingthatsentiment, Frederickthe GreatofPrussia declared: “No wom-an should everbe allowed to governanything.” Within monthsofreachingthe throne in 1740, he fell upon the newlycrowned ArchduchessofAustria, MariaTheresa, and seized Silesia, herempire’srichestprovince. Despite yearsofwar,she neverrecovered it. Indeed, unmar-ried queenswere attacked more oftenthan anyothermonarchs. ThinkofEliza-beth I, the historical ﬁgure with whomTheresa Maymostidentiﬁes, fending oﬀthe Spanish Armada.Butperceived weaknessisnotthewhole story. Queens, the researchersfound, were more likelyto gain newterritory. Afteroverthrowingherhus-band, Catherine the Great(pictured)expanded herempire bysome 200,000square miles(518,000 sq km), which isalotofterritory, even forRussia. (She wasthe ﬁrst, though notthe last, Russian rulerto annexCrimea.) And married queenswere more aggressive than single queensorkings, whethersingle ormarried. The authorssuggestseveral reasonsforthis. First, married queensmay havebeen able to forge more militaryalli-ances, emboldeningthem to pickﬁghts.While female martial leadership re-mained taboo, male spouseshad oftenserved in the armybefore theymarried,and were well placed to cementmilitarytiesbetween theirhomelandsand theirwives’ states. Second, unlike mostkings, queensoften gave theirspousesa lotofpower,sometimesputtingthem in charge offoreign policyorthe economy. FerdinandII, who ruled Aragon and Castile withIsabella I between 1479 and 1504, led theexpulsion ofthe Moorsfrom Granada.Duringthe 1740sMaria Theresa’shus-band, FrancisI, overhauled the Austrianeconomyand raised moneyforthearmed forceswhile hiswife ruled muchofcentral Europe. Prince AlbertwasQueen Victoria’smosttrusted adviser,shapingherforeign policyuntil his deathin 1861. Thisdivision oflabour, the au-thorssuggest, freed up time forqueens topursue more aggressive policies.In the democraticera, too, femaleleadershave foughttheirshare ofwars:thinkofIndira Gandhi and Pakistan,Golda Meirand the Yom Kippurwar, orMargaretThatcherand the Falklands. Thenumberofcountriesled bywomen hasmore than doubled since 2000, butthereisplentyofroom forimprovement: thecurrentlevel of15 representslessthan 10%ofthe total.

The sittingLabourMP, Richard Bur-den, hasheld the seatsince 1992. Yetwhen she saysthatshe has agood chance ofwinning, she isdoingmore than indulging in acandidate’scompulsorybravado.

The Conservatives’ successfulcampaign to make AndyStreetmayorofthe WestMidlands hasleftthem with infrastructure and momentum. MsPowell-Chandlerispartofa concerted Conservative at-temptto advance into Labourterritory. The Torieslaunched theirmanifesto in Halifax, a Yorkshire town with a longhistory asabastion ofthe LabourParty. Theresa May’sitinerarylookslike aguided tourofpost-industrial Britain. The central pitch ofhermanifesto isthatthe state hasa dutyto protectpeople againstthevagaries(includingimmigration) thatcan make itimpossible toclingonto respectability.The Tories’ election campaign haslostitssense ofinevitabilityto mixed pollsand backbiting. Butitisworth bearingtwo thingsin mind. The ﬁrstisthatthe Conservativeshave made most oftherunning: Labourhasbeen ﬁghtingto defend itshome turf bycampaigningin Labourconstituenciesand promisingto expandthe welfare state and nationalise industries. The second isthatthe Tories’ strategyisa bold one. Theybelieve thatthe inhabit-antsofpost-industrial Britain have been ripe forthe picking foryears—these are the grandchildren ofindustrial workers, who be-longto the world ofNetﬂixand all-you-can-eatbuﬀets ratherthan the mill and the chapel—and thatthe pluckinghasbeenmade even easierbythree recentevents: the rise ofJeremy Cor-byn, the selection ofMrsMayand Brexit. The blue-collarstrategywasresponsible forthe biggestmess-up ofthe campaign. The decision to include a pledge in themanifesto to require old people who live in valuable houses tomeetmore ofthe costsoftheirin-home care wasintended todemonstrate thatthe Conservativesare notjustthe party ofel-derly, rich southerners. Itwentdown well with working-classvoters, who didn’tsee whytheyshould payforthe care of peoplein million-pound houses. The problem wasnotjustthatthe poli-cyfailed to puta cap on howmuch people mightpay. It wasthatitrevealed the clash ofinterestsbetween the people the Tories al-readyrepresentand those theywantto convert. Itwasalso responsible forthe biggestfrustration of the cam-paign: MrCorbyn’sfailure to self-destruct. The Conservatives cal-culated thatworking-classvoterswould instinctivelyprefer MrsMay, a proud productofmiddle England, to MrCorbyn, a hard-line leftistwho representsa trendybitofLondon, Islington North.Butthe storyhasbeen more complicated. MrsMay’srefusal toturn up to a debate with the leadersofthe main parties on May31stmade herlookweak. And MrCorbyn’slongrecord ofbackinghopelesscauseshasmade him lookstrongand stable. Ed Mili-band, hispredecessor, irritated votersbecause he always seemedto be apologisingforhimself. MrCorbyn doesn’tthinkhe hasanythingto apologise for.Yeteven ifthe goingistougherthan the Toriesimagined, thestrategymaystill yield results. The clearestreason for thisisBrexit. Post-industrial England and Walesvoted overwhelminglyforit, and leaversseem to feel more stronglythan remainers.Hampshire isnotlikelyto go LabourbutNorthﬁeld may well goTory. The lessobviousreason ispeople like MsPowell-Chandler.David Cameron’smodernisation ofthe partyhasyielded a cropofsensible-lookingand hard-workingcandidateswho are nowtryingto sell the Conservative brand in unfamiliarterritory.Trickyto collarBagehot’swhirlwind tourofworking-classconstituenciesin theWestMidlands, Northumberland and Durham suggeststhatopinion isin ﬂux. People are angrywith the political establish-ment, annoyed aboutbeingasked to vote again and disappoint-ed in the choice on oﬀer. Labourvotersare divided over theirparty, respondingto MrCorbyn’scall fora more justand gener-oussocietybutworryingaboutsome ofhisviews—particularlyhislackofpatriotism—and hisincompetence. And there are agrowingnumberofoutspoken Torysupportersdeep behind La-bourlines. Raymond, a tattooed Glaswegian who haslived inBishop Auckland, a Durham constituency, since 1995, proclaimsthathe will be votingforMrsMaybecause “I’m a Brexitman.

Accordingto a leaked tran-script, he said: “I justwantto congratulateyoubecause I am hearingofthe unbeliev-able job on the drugproblem.” Since MrDuterte waselected in June lastyear, hisanti-drugscampaign hasled to the killingofaround 9,000 people, mainlypettydeal-ersand users. Acouple ofweeksearlier, MrTrump had called the Turkish president,Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to congratulate himon winninga referendum grantinghimsweepingnewpowers. Since an attemptedcoup lastyear, more than 100,000 Turkshave been arrested ordetained: the judi-ciaryhasbeen shredded, journalistsjailedand media outletsshutdown.Lastweek, in Saudi Arabia on the ﬁrstlegofa nine-dayforeign trip, MrTrumppraised Egypt’spresident, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi (pictured). “Safetyseemsto be verystrong” in Egypt, he gushed.

She fearsthatifAmerica no longerspeaksup forhuman rightsin internation-al forums, the consensuson such thingswill be atrisk. MsGreen pointsto people-traﬃckingasan issue where American en-gagementhasmade a bigdiﬀerence. Since2000America hasproduced a “Traﬃckingin Persons” reporteach year, which itusesto lobbyothergovernments. In 2001only12 countriesmetthe highest“tier1” stan-dard; now36 do, and 169 are partyto a UNprotocol on traﬃcking.America hashad close relationshipswith odiousregimesin the past, and has isclear: thisisa presidentwho gets on bet-terwith authoritarian regimesthan Ameri-ca’straditional democraticpartners. MrTrump’ssecretaryofstate, RexTiller-son, conveyed a similarimpression to hisdepartment’semployeeson May3rd. Heused the loaded phrase “America First”—coined byisolationistsseekingto keepAmerica outofthe second world war—todeﬁne the newadministration’sforeignpolicy. Central to histheme wasthat thepursuitofinterestsmusttake precedenceoverthe promotion ofvalues. Diplomatscould expresssupportfordemocracy, therule oflawand human rights, butonly ifthatdid notputan “obstacle” in the wayofnational-securityand economicinterests.Thisrepresentsa rupture with at leastfourdecadesofbipartisan consensusin fa-vourofliberal internationalism. Far fromconﬂictingwith America’sinterests, ar-guesTed Piccone, a formerforeign policyadviserin the Clinton administration nowatthe BrookingsInstitution, advancingnormative valuesisessential to those inter-ests, and isthe basisforAmerica’snationalprestige and international legitimacy.In a recentarticle EliotCohen, an advis-erto the State DepartmentunderGeorgeBush junior, observed thatopen societiesgoverned bythe rule oflaw“make inﬁnite-lybetteralliesin the longrun than thugssittingon powderkegs”.

At itsnextsession, startingthismonth, DonaldTrump’sambassadorto the UN, Nikki Ha-ley, isexpected to saywhetherAmericawill stayor, asitdid underGeorge W. Bushin 2006, leave in a huﬀ. She islikely, attheleast, to putthe council “on notice”.Yetvirtuallyeveryone who caresabouthuman rightshopesAmerica will stay.Though selectivelyand patchily, the coun-cil haspromoted justice around the world.When America hasbacked itorarguedfrom within, ithasbeen more eﬀective.Even Israel’sgovernmentsaysAmerica, forthe time beingatleast, should stayin.In 2006 the council replaced the UNCommission on Human Rights, which hadbeen irredeemablydiscredited, notleastbybeingchaired justa fewyearsearlier byLibya, then ruled bythe despoticMuam-marQaddaﬁ. The newbodywassmaller,and its47 memberswould be elected (inﬁve geographical clusters) bythe UN Gen-eral Assembly, which could, bya two-thirdsmajority, chuckoutanymemberjudged to have committed “grossand sys-tematicviolationsofhuman rights”.Thishashappened too rarely. Ofthecurrentmembers, some have dire records:Burundi, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and Vene-zuela, forinstance. Regional blocshave of-ten been biased, shieldingtheirmembersfrom criticism. “Itisan assemblyofstates,nota beautyparade ofsaints,” saysa hu-man-rightscampaigner. Israel still receivesoutsized criticism,notleastbecause a standingagenda topic(“Item 7”) on the Palestinian Territoriesmustbe raised ateverysession. Accordingto UN Watch, a Geneva-based pro-Israelimonitor, in the council’sﬁrstdecade 68 res-olutionswere passed againstIsrael and 67againsteverywhere else. Bycontrast, saysUN Watch, Syria hasbeen condemned 20times, North Korea nine times, Iran six andSudan three. (The UN classiﬁesitsresolu-tionsslightlydiﬀerently, and saysUNWatch exaggerates.) Though the newbodyprovidesfor“special sessions” to discussgrosshuman-rightsviolations, govern-mentscommittingatrocitiesin places suchasChechnya and Zimbabwe have neverbeen condemned outright.The UN and human rightsAmerica, you’restill neededGENEVAThe Human Rights Council is ﬂawed,butan American exitwould worsen iton occasion oﬀered hypocritical justiﬁca-tionsforself-interested policies. But theguidingprinciple, articulated byWoodrowWilson a centuryago, thatitshould use itspowerforgood in the world hasendured.Dean Acheson, secretaryofstate in theearly1950s, described “the American idea”asan inspiration to people who could only“dream offreedom”. Buthe knewthatdream wasconstrained bya nuclear-armed communistRussia. In reality, saysSirLawrence Freedman, a British strategistand historian, the ideological struggle withthe SovietUnion tookprecedence over hu-man rights. Adescription ofAnastasio So-moza, Nicaragua’sdictator, sometimesat-tributed to HarryTruman—“He’sa bastard,buthe’sourbastard”—wasoften cited to ex-cuse poorcompany. Richard Nixon andHenryKissingerputreachingdetente withthe rival superpowerahead ofwhattheysawasgrandstandingon human rights.Aturningpointcame in 1975 when Pres-identGerald Ford refused to meetAlex-anderSolzhenitsyn, an authorwho ex-posed the evilsofthe Sovietgulag.Conservative Republicans, such asReagan,JackKemp and William Buckley, accusedhim ofappeasement, asdid Democrats, in-cludingHenryJackson and JimmyCarter.In a speech in 1977 MrCartermarked a re-turn to Wilsonianism: “Itisa newworldthatcallsfora newAmerican foreign poli-cy…We have reaﬃrmed America’scom-mitmentto human rightsasa fundamentaltenetofourforeign policy.”Although MrCarterran into diﬃcultyoverAmerica’ssupportforthe Shah ofIran, hisvision wasshared byhissucces-sor, Reagan. Liberalsand conservativeshad found somethingtheycould agree on.Human rightsalso helped win the coldwar. The partofthe Helsinki Final Act of1975 (an accord between Eastand West)coveringhuman rightsdid much to legiti-mise dissentin the Sovietempire. In the early1990s, with the cold warover, values-based foreign policywentinto overdrive with whatTonySmith, ahistorian atTuftsUniversity, callsneo-Wilsonianism. He arguesthatitrested onthree ideasshared byneoconservativesand neoliberal interventionists. The ﬁrst,“democraticpeace theory”, held thatasde-mocraciesdid notwage waron each other,the more countrieshad democraticinstitu-tions, the more peaceful the world wouldbe. The second, “democratictransition the-ory”, postulated a greatglobal momentumtowardsdemocracy. The West, with itsfree-marketeconomicmodel, primacyinmultilateral organisationsand human-rightspressure groupscould accelerate thespread ofdemocracyeven in placeswithfewofthe institutional underpinnings.The third was“responsibilityto protect”(known asR2P), a reworkingofjustwartheorydeveloped afterthe world’sfailureto preventthe Rwandan genocide in 1994. Together, these formed the frameworkforinterventionsin Bosnia, Sierra Leoneand Kosovo. Britain’sprime minister, TonyBlair, a keen advocate ofthe newinterven-tionism, laid outitsprinciplesin a speechin 1999 co-authored bySirLawrence. Butearlysuccessspawned hubris. Combinedwith the “global waron terror” launchedbyGeorge W. Bush afterSeptember11th2001, itled to ﬂawed attemptsat“nation-building” in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sir Law-rence says: “R2Ppushed usinto doingmorethan we reasonablycould.”BarackObama did notresile from thehuman-rightsagenda. Buthe became in-creasinglydoubtful aboutusingmilitaryforce to buttressit. MsGreen, who servedin the American agencyforinternationaldevelopmentunderMrObama, sayshe setgreatstore by“civic-societyengagement”to push authoritarian regimestowards in-ternational norms. He also believed thatspeakingouton human rightswhen meet-ingautocratsboosted campaigners, evenwhen hislecturinggrated.MrObama wasmore ofa Wilsonianthan a neo-Wilsonian; hisidealism tem-pered bya cool realism thatverged on cyn-icism. Forhim the Middle East, exempliﬁedbyLibya, wasa “shitshow” thatAmericacould do little to change. Butcritics sawhisreluctance to intervene in Syria asan abdi-cation ofAmerican responsibility. MrObama reﬂected a lossofconﬁ-dence in the certaintiesofthe neolibs andneocons. He mayhave allowed the pendu-lum to swingbacktoo far, buthe reﬂectedthe mood ofwar-wearyvoters. MrTrumpstandsforsomethingdiﬀerentand darker:acontemptuousrepudiation ofthe use ofAmerican strength in the service ofany-thingotherthan self-interest. Hisenthusi-asm fora brute like MrDuterte gives heartto bruteseverywhere.

Yetthe convention and protocol, evenifﬂouted, are notpointless. They lockcountriesinto a legal frameworkthatenablesvictimsand theirlawyersto putperpetratorsundera spotlight. Theyerode impunityand increase the likeli-hood thatvictimsare heard.While rich countrieshave led the way,abouta ﬁfth ofthe world’sgovern-ments—those thatdo noteven pretend touphold human rights—have refused tosign. “It’sthe in-betweensthathave seendramaticimprovements,” saysFeliceGaerofthe NewYork-based Jacob Blaus-tein Institute forthe AdvancementofHuman Rights, one often elected expertson the UN’sCommittee againstTorture.Reforminggovernmentswho replaceauthoritarian ordespoticonestend to bekeenestto tackle torture, often confront-ingtheirown armyorpolice.

The council has stead-fastlymonitored the horrorsin Syria andplayed a helpful role in Myanmar, Colom-bia and (aftera poorstart) Sri Lanka.The disproportionate focuson Israel islessening. From 2010 to 2016 onlyone spe-cial session washeld on Israel/Palestine,down from sixin the previousfouryears,saysthe council’sspokesman. The share oftime spenton Item 7 hashalved, to 8%. The qualityofmembersmayimprove,too, asregional groupsare a bitless willingto shield theirown. LastyearRussia lostitsseat, receiving32 votesfewerthan Hunga-ry, and two fewerthan Croatia.

None ofthenine worsthuman-rightsoﬀenders, asranked byFreedom House, a Washington-based NGO, (Syria, Eritrea, North Korea,Uzbekistan, South Sudan, Turkmenistan,Somalia, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea)haseverbeen elected to the council. In atellingmomentin 2014, a forcefullycriticalresolution on Sri Lanka waspassed. Thingsstarted to change in 2010, saysMarcLimon, a British formeroﬃcial in thecouncil, who nowheadsthe UniversalRightsGroup, a Geneva-based think-tank,when a clutch ofindependent-mindedcountries, includingMauritius, Mexicoand Morocco, began to vote more freely, of-ten forAmerican-backed resolutions. Be-fore then, membersofthe 57-strongOrga-nisation ofIslamicCo-operation (OIC)andthe African Group (whose membersoftenoverlapped and laterreconﬁgured astheLike-Minded Group) “virtuallycontrolledthe council”, he says. Anti-Westernershaverecentlybeen defeated orforced to com-promise on several issues. Aresolution toexemptblasphemyfrom free-speech pro-tectionswasfended oﬀagainstthe wishesofthe Like-Minded. The same group failedto blocka resolution to appointan inde-pendentexpertto investigate discrimina-tion againstgayand transgenderpeople. American diplomacyunderBarackObama wasa bigreason forthe shift.“It’safactthatthe US takesthe lead in protectingpeople around the world,” saysNavi Pillay,aformerhigh commissionerforhumanrights, citingAmerica’skeyrole in persuad-ingthe council to take on Sri Lanka in 2014.AsforIsrael, saysa Western ambassador,“Itwould have been much worse foritifthe US hadn’tbeen there.”MsHaleyislikelyto make two de-mands. The ﬁrst, to drop the permanentanti-Israel item from the agenda, will prob-ablybe refused. The second, thatmembersshould be elected competitivelyratherthan byregional blocsvotingfor“cleanslates” (pre-cooked lists), ismore feasiblebutstill unlikely.

First, the law isover-lybroad and mischievouslyvague. Itpro-videslittle guidance on whatconstitutes“critical information infrastructure”(though impacton “social oreconomicwell-being” isa criterion) and which ﬁrmsare “networkoperators” (so even individ-ualswith multiple computerscould fallfoul ofthe law).

With a total market valueof$2.9trn, theyare worth more than anyﬁve ﬁrmsin history.Elevated tech valuationsused to be a sign ofhysteria. Today’sinvestorsbelieve theyare makingan ice-cold judgmentthat theseﬁrmsare the dominantoligopoliesofthe 21stcenturyand will ex-tracta vast, rising, ﬂowofproﬁts.

Yet, oddly, the biggesttech ﬁrmshavethe opposite approach. Togethertheyhave $330bn ofnetcash(cash lessdebt), a ratio oftwice theirgrosscashﬂow. The pile farexceedsthe cash buﬀersthattech and pharmaceu-tical ﬁrmstraditionallycarryto compensate fortheir lackofphys-ical assetsthatdebtcan be secured against.

Factoringin these pro-grammes, and analysts’ proﬁtforecasts, theirtotal netcash willreach $680bn by2020, orthree timesgrosscashﬂow. Even Ama-zon, which hasa relativelysmall pile now, will reach $50bn.One reason forthe cash build up istax: 80% ofthe ﬁve ﬁrms’grosscash isheld abroad, allowingthem to deferthe levy Ameri-can ﬁrmspaywhen repatriatingproﬁts. The bill forbringing halfthe cash home mightbe about$50bn. Thatisnotto be sniﬀed at,butbeingcleverabouttaxhasbecome an excuse forﬁrms to ob-fuscate and ditherabouttheirplansfortheirbalance sheets.The cash cushion isfarlargerthan isneeded to absorb shocks,such asa ﬁnancial crash ora hackingattack.

Atorrentofmoneyisalreadyﬂowinginto data centres, soft-ware, newheadquartersand “moon shots” such asdriverlesscarsand immortalitydrugs. In orderforthe ﬁrmsto spend all ofthe cashﬂowtheyare on trackto retain, annual investmentwould need to rise to almost$300bn by2020.Thatisovertwice whatthe global venture-capital industryspendseach year. Itis51timesthe annual cash burned up byNet-ﬂix, Uberand Tesla, three ﬁrmsfamousforbeingcash hungry.And itis37 timesthe average annual amountofcash the ﬁve ﬁrmshave in total spenton acquisitionsto gain newtechnologies andproducts, such asFacebook’s$19bn purchase ofWhatsApp, amessagingservice in 2014, orGoogle’s$3.1bn acquisition ofDou-bleClick, an advertisingﬁrm, in 2007.Mightthese ﬁrmshoard cash justbecause theyare run bymegalomaniacswho are too rich and odd to obeyanyrules?

Themain reason forthe deal, saysTim Zimmer-man, Standard’schiefexecutive, wastherisingcostofregulation—though competi-tion from PNC, a $371bn colossusbased inthe city, also played a part. “Withouttheregulatoryoverreach…since the crisis,” MrZimmerman says, “we’d probablybothhave gone alongon ourown, I think.”Standard isone ofAmerica’s5,400communitybanks: local lenders, fundedchieﬂybydeposits, who pride themselveson knowingtheirturfbythe inch and theircustomersbyname. Theirsize can rangeup to $10bn in assets, butmostare muchsmaller: over5,000 banksand savingsin-stitutionshave lessthan $1bn and morethan 1,500 under$100m. Theyaccountfor92% offederallyinsured banks.

BothJeb Hensarling, chairman ofthe House ofRepresentativesFinancial ServicesCom-mittee, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasurysecretary, addressed the ICBAatbreakfast,before the bankersheaded forCapitol Hill.Regulation, especiallyofmortgages, iscommunitybankers’ number-one com-plaint.

Butmaintainingtheseentitlementsdoesnotfullyprotectwork-ers’ retirementincome. Formany, pensionpromisesfrom theiremployersare moreimportant. These can shrinkorvanishwhen ﬁrmsfail. And, like Social Security,the programme thatprotectsretireesagainstsuch losses—the Pension BeneﬁtGuarantyCorporation—isgoingbust.The PBGC leviespremiumson deﬁned-beneﬁtpension plansin orderto bail outthose thatfail (up to a maximum payoutperworker). On currenttrends, one of itsinsurance schemeswill probablyrun dryby2025. The problem isso-called “multi-employer” funds(see chart). These involvemultiple ﬁrms, usuallyunderan agree-mentwith an industry-wide union. Theycoverabout10m Americans, roughly1m ofwhom are in a plan thatadmitsitisproba-blybroke. The biggeststruggleristhe Cen-tral Statesfund, which coversabout400,000 currentand formertruckdrivers.Amulti-employerplan isa fragile thing.When a participatingﬁrm goesunder, oth-ersmustpickup the tab foritsworkers, or“orphans”. Butsurvivingﬁrmshave an es-cape route. Theymaywithdrawfrom aplan so longastheypaytheirshare of itsprojected deﬁcit. Because fundsoften as-sume unrealisticallyhigh investmentre-turns, such shortfallsare usuallyunder-stated. Thatmakeswithdrawingfrom aplan a good deal forthe ﬁrm and a bad oneforthe orphans.Overtime, realitybites. So just asitisbestto be atthe frontofthe queue during abankrun, itisbestto be the ﬁrstﬁrm to exitthe plan. The onlyobstacle isthatthe rele-vantunion mustagree to a withdrawal. Butworkers, fearingthattheiremployermightgo bust, orneedingto win concessions onothermatters, often do. Forexample, UPS,adeliveryﬁrm, pulled outofthe CentralStatesplan in 2007.Such exitshave caused the health ofmulti-employerplansto worsen rapidly. Inturn, thatthreatensPBGC, which ison thehookwhenevera plan fails. Atlastcount,the agency’smulti-employerprogrammehad assetsofa little over$2bn supportingliabilitiesofover$61bn. Whatisto be done? The Trump admin-istration’sproposed budgetfor2018 plugsthe hole byraisingpremiumsdramatically,chargingmore to planswith biggerdeﬁcits,and levyinga punitive “exitpremium” onquitters. Thisbuildson an Obama-era pro-posal simplyto letPBGCdecide whatpre-miumsto charge. Firms, fearinghefty rises,hated thatidea, and will probablylobbyagainstMrTrump’splan, too, should it be-come draftlegislation. In anycase, raisingpremiumscan onlydo so much. Ifﬁrmsquitplansen masse,there will be nobodyleftto paypremiums,saysJoshua Gotbaum, who ran PBGCfrom2010 to 2014. So itismore importantto pre-ventfailuresbyallowingﬁrmsto trim fu-ture payouts.Alawpassed in 2014 setup aprocessforsuch restructurings. Itsprimetargetwasthe Central Statesplan. Yet theObama administration rejected itsrestruc-turingproposal in 2016.MrTrump’sattitude to pension cuts isstill unknown. (Itmayalreadybe too lateto save Central States.) Left-wingDemo-cratsoppose beneﬁtcuts, because theywantthe taxpayerto prop up failingplans.Yetan attemptatthisfailed in 2010, whenDemocratscontrolled government. WithRepublicansin charge itisa pipe-dream. Thatistrue even with the populist MrTrump in the White House.

Whatotherscannotaﬀord to build, theycan still rent.WASHINGTON, DCA199-year-old bank’s tech adventurehe doubtsthatitdoes.Camden Fine, head ofthe ICBA, likensthe rulesto a “cookie-cutter”. In essence,only“qualiﬁed” mortgagesmeetingcer-tain criteria (eg, on the ratio ofdebt to in-come) maybe sold to Fannie Mae andFreddie Mac, the government-ownedgiantsthatdominate the secondarymar-ket. Banksfearthatiftheymake loans thatdo notﬁtthe template, borrowerswho areunable to repaymaysue, claimingthatlenderswere careless. The ICBAknowsofno suitsyet, butbankersare nervous. ScottHeitkamp, chiefexecutive ofValueBankTexas, in CorpusChristi, sayshe no longermakessuch loans, although “theywereourbread and butterforyears”. MrZim-merman does, “with trepidation”.Despite all this, communitybanks’businessmodel hasheld up prettywell. Inthe 12 monthsto March, accordingto theFederal DepositInsurance Corporation(FDIC), the main supervisorofmostofthem, communitybanks’ loan booksgrewby7.7%, more than twice the rate atother,mainlymuch bigger, lenders. Netincomerose by10.4%, against12.7% forthe wholeindustry. Returnson equity, at9.2%, were alittle belowthe average.Nevertheless, the ﬁxed costsofregula-tion weigh more on them than on biggerlenders. And theyhave othertroubles tocontend with. Perhapsmostimportantisthe costofkeepingup with informationtechnology—both to provide customerswith the online servicestheyhave come toexpect(see box) and to guard againstcyber-attacks—which, like regulation, isaheavierburden the smalleryouare. The ex-pense of“two deliverychannels” creates“anotherpressure point”, saysStandard’sMrZimmerman.Anotherconcern issuccession plan-ning, which ata bankrequiresﬁndingsomeone with specialised expertise. Manycommunitybanksare family-run, and chil-dren maynotalwaysfollowin theirpar-ents’ footsteps(though plentydo: RebecaRomero Rainey, who succeedsMrFine atthe ICBAnextyear, runsCentinel Bank inTaos, NewMexico, founded byhergrand-fatherin 1969).

Noteveryone wantsto workin out-of-the-wayplaces—andholdingon to people in cities, where bigbanksprowl, can be hard too. And fourth,marginsbetween lendingand borrowingrates, from which communitybanksmakemostoftheirmoney, have been thin, andhave latelydeclined slightly.Communitybankersblame the paucityofnewbanks, too, on heavy-handed regu-lation. The FDIC, arguablytoo slowto actbefore the crisis, became more cautiousafterit. Amongotherthings, itextendedthe period ofcloserscrutinyofnewbanksfrom three yearsto seven (ithassince beencutbackto three). Butthe decline in banks’price-to-bookratiosafterthe crisis wasprobablyalso important, encouragingmergersand purchasesofexistingbanksratherthan the openingofnewones. Thisarithmeticmaybe goinginto reverse: ﬁveapplicationsforchartersare pending. Butthatisstill justa trickle. The bankershope lighterregulation ison the way.

Then came Donald Trump, whotrashed them, yetwon the presidency. He upended Republicanpositionson trade, and exposed the vulnerabilityofthe Demo-craticPartyon itshome economicturf: the well-beingof Ameri-can workers. He also seemsto have liberated the leftto thinkbigideas—and confronthard questions. Since 1992 Democraticeconomicpolicyhasbeen rooted intechnocraticcentrism, meantto smooth the rough edgesof themarket. “We rejectboth the do-nothinggovernmentofthe last 12yearsand the big-governmenttheorythatsayswe can hamstringbusinessand taxand spend ourwayto prosperity,” read the partyplatform in 1992. “Instead we oﬀera third way.” Thiswasa desper-ate eﬀortto escape the political wilderness. Yetitalso reﬂected in-tellectual trendsin economics. Inﬂation and fallingproductivityin the 1970sseemed to bearoutthe viewsofeconomistssuch asMilton Friedman, thatfastergrowth could onlybe achievedthrough freermarkets. Left-leaningeconomistslargelyconcededthe point. Democratssoughtto level the playingﬁeld a bitthrough education and progressive taxation, butgenerally theyaccepted thata limbereconomyoﬀered the bestroute to growthand good jobs.Conﬁdence in the approach ebbed aswage growth stalled inthe 2000s. RepublicansspentBill Clinton’sbudgetsurpluson taxcutsforthe rich, and, in 2008, the American economyfell into itsworstcrisissince the 1930s. In 2011Dean Baker, a left-leaningecon-omistatthe Centre forEconomicand PolicyResearch, publishedabookattacking“loserliberalism”. He argued thatRepublicanpolicies—from trade dealsthatabove all aﬀected low-skilledmanufacturingjobsto “right-to-work” lawsthatsapped labourpower—could be seen aswaysto alterthe balance ofeconomicpowerasmuch asprincipled attemptsto liberate markets. Demo-crats’ narrowfocuson eﬃciency, playingdown labour’slossofbargainingpower, meantworkerswere taken forsuckers. Thatviewisincreasinglyheld acrossthe American left. Stag-nantwagesand risinginequalityseem to vindicate critics ofthe“neoliberal” approach. Recentresearch laysbare howfeeblyworkerswere able to adjustto the costsofglobalisation, and sug-geststhatinequalityand inadequate governmentspendingcould doom the economyto perpetual, “secular” stagnation. The leftisyetto decide howto respond. Leadingvoices, likeBernie Sandersand Elizabeth Warren, full-throatedlydeclare thatthe economyhasbeen rigged againstworkingpeople. Their pro-posalsare farbolderthan recentDemocraticplatforms. Aplan tomake tuition atpublicuniversitiesfree formostpeople, and to re-duce student-loan debt, would allowyoungworkersmore roomto experimentwith diﬀerentcareersaftergraduation. A single-payerhealth-insurance system would allowworkersto leavejobstheydo notlike withoutfearoflossofhealth-care coverage,boostingworkers’ leverage. In contrast, the orthodoxyamongcentre-lefteconomists hasnotshifted much. Theyfavourinvestmentin publicgoods, likeeducation and research, and wage subsidies, which boost in-comesofthe poorwithoutdiscouragingwork. Some, like LarrySummers, reckon thatchronicallyweakdemand impliesa needforbiggergovernmentdeﬁcits, ideallyspenton worthwhile infra-structure projects. Worriesaboutcorporate concentration andmarketpowerare renewinginterestin antitrustpolicy. Asthe leftgrappleswith these issues, itisconsidering twowildlyambitiousproposalsforreformingthe welfare state. Oneenvisagesa job guarantee: a policyonce embraced byMartin Lu-therKingand more recentlyendorsed bythe Centre forAmericanProgress, a centre-leftthink-tank. Anyadultwho wants a jobwould be promised one, payinga salary(and beneﬁts, for thosewho worksuﬃcienthours) ofperhaps$12 perhour. The govern-mentcould assign workdirectly, orserve asa clearing-housematchingwould-be workerswith openingsin projectssubmittedbycommunitiesorlocal governments. The aim ofthe policywould be to seta ﬂoorforlivingstandardsand private-sector jobquality, while meetingunmetsocial needs.The otherbigidea isa universal basicincome (UBI): a “citizen’sdividend” paid to everyadultwhetherworkingornot. AUBIisnotexclusivelya leftyproposal. Some envision itasa simplerre-placement, in the form ofa cash payment, forlotsofother gov-ernment-beneﬁtprogrammes. Silicon Valleymogulsare enthusi-asticaboutit; MarkZuckerberg(whose politicsare obscure)praised the idea in a recentspeech. On the left, a UBIisoften seenasa welcome newentitlementthatwould enshrine the idea that,no mattertheircircumstances, all deserve to beneﬁtfrom eco-nomicgrowth. Fornow, both policiesremain pie in the sky. Ifimplementednationally, theywould require vastincreasesin taxcollection,and could generate large, unforeseeable and unwelcome side-ef-fects. Butthe two policiesshare an importantfeature: theygiveworkersthe abilityto walkawayfrom lousyprivate-sector jobs. Labour’s love lostShould theyprove politicallyviable, such ideasnonethelessleave the leftin a bind. Both a job guarantee and a UBIcreatepaths(albeitdivergingones) to a world where mostpeople do nothold paying, private-sectorjobs. Although the abilityto rejectbadjobsiscrucial to establishinglabourpower, itmightalso hastenthe daywhen lotsofworkersare simplyunnecessaryto the func-tioningofthe economy. Thatisa diﬃcultand riskypill to swallowfora partyhistoricallycommitted to strengtheningthe role ofla-bour.

Thatwasinteresting, fordespite all the research intoautism, feweﬀective treatmentsare avail-able.

To ﬁxthat, Intel and SpeculurTechnologySolutions, a ﬁrm based inBangalore, have developed BatSense, adiminutive gadgetthatplayerscan attachto the top oftheircricketbat.

Apredic-tion ofAlbertEinstein’stheoryofgeneralrelativity, theoristshad longsuspected thatsuch waves—ripplingdistortionsin the fab-ricofspace itself—were real. Butno onehad seen one. Theywere eventuallyre-vealed bya billion-dollarinstrumentcalled the LaserInterferometerGravita-tional-Wave Observatory(LIGO), which isbased attwo sitesin Louisiana and Wash-ington. LIGOworksbybouncinglasersdown tunnelswith mirrorsateach end. Apassinggravitywave will stretch and com-pressspace, causingtinychangesin thetime ittakesa beam to traverse the tunnels. The wavesthatLIGOspotted werecaused bythe joining, 1.3bn yearsago, ofapairofblackholes, 36 and 29 timesasmas-sive asthe sun. Such mergersare amongthe mostpowerful eventsin the universe:the coalescingholesbrieﬂypumped out 50timesmore energythan all the restof thestarsin the universe combined.Theyare also fairlycommon. LIGO’sﬁrstdetection tookplace in September2015. Three monthslater, itsawanothersuch event. And on June 1st, LIGOan-nounced itshat-trick, reportinga third de-tection which had taken place on January4th, 2017. The ﬁrstdetection wasa spectac-ularpiece ofphysicsthatwill likely earnLIGO’smastersa Nobel prize in due course.Butthe second and third—and othersthatthe instrumentwill surelymake in future—belongmore to the realm ofastronomy. ForLIGOisboth a physicsexperimentand atelescope thatoﬀersan entirelynew wayto lookatthe universe. Mosttelescopesmake use ofthe elec-tromagneticspectrum, from high-frequen-cygamma raysto low-frequencyradiowavesand everywavelength (includingvisible light) in between. Gravitywavesare notpartofthe electromagneticspec-trum, and are produced bydiﬀerentphysi-cal forces.

Howcommon such encountersare isan open question in astronomy. Themore such detectionsLIGOmakes, the bet-terthe understandingastronomerswillhave ofhowblackholesevolve.In the future, the trickle ofdata shouldbecome a ﬂood. Virgo isa European detec-torwhose staﬀare collaboratingwith theLIGOteam and which isdue to reach its fullcapacityin 2018. AJapanese instrumentnamed KAGRAshould begin takingdatathatsame year. Indian researchersare keento build a detectoroftheirown.

Butreviewers’ namescould bereattached when itistime forperformanceappraisals, givingtheirbossesproof oftheextra work.

Such “post-publication” peerreviewisalreadycommon on websitessuch asar-Xiv, where physicistsand mathematicianspostearlyversionsofpapersthatwill laterbe published in journals.

Victorian London rangwith thelanguage ofhorsemanship: the cloppinghoovesofcabbies, vanners, sweepers, ves-tryhorses, costers’ ponies, breweryShires,bussers, growlersand trammersaswell asthe ridinghorsesofthe gentry. By1901,when there were more horsesin townsthan in the country, workinghorsescon-sumed almostexactlythe same amountofgrain and hayaswasproduced byBritishfarmers. Buttheirdaysas“forced labourers”, asMrRaulﬀdescribesit, were numbered.“Fora century, the oat-powered enginewasthe universal and irreplaceable powerunitin the forced mechanisation oftheworld,” he writes—until “the lastgenera-tion ofthe 19th centuryrealised thatas mo-tors, horseswere costly, sensitive and unre-liable…the mechanical horse islighter,stronger, faster, more enduring, cleaner,easierto steer.” The change, when itcame,wasrapid. In 1901over1m horsesstillworked on British farms. By1956 therewere 147,000—and 370,000 tractors. “Farewell to the Horse” ostensiblycoversthe period ofthe “long19th cen-tury”, which startswith Napoleon andendswith the ﬁrstworld war.

Overthe pastcenturyhorsesin theWesthave evolved from labourersintowhatMrRaulﬀcallsa “part-time job asarecreational item, a mode oftherapy, a sta-tussymbol and a source ofpastoral sup-portforfemale puberty”. (Although, asMsForrestpointsout, in 201160% ofall horsesand 95% ofdonkeyswere workingin thedevelopingworld, with the moneygener-ated foreach animal beingsuﬃcient tosupporta familyofup to 20.) In the devel-oped world theyhave been replaced withmachines. The ironyishard to miss: hu-manstamed horsesand putthem to workuntil theyinvented somethingthatworkedatgreaterspeed and lowercost, which re-placed them. Could humansone daymakethemselvesobsolescentin the same way?In a section aboutwar, MsForrest tellsof12 cavalryhorses, veteransofthe BattleofWaterloo, thatwere boughtatauctionbythe king’ssurgeon, who broughtthemhome, operated on them and turned themloose to graze. “One morning…the sur-geon sawthe 12 horsesform a line, shoul-derto shoulder, then, withouta cue, chargeforward ata gallop.

He wasright. The WestVirginia Universityre-searchersinside the carhad nothingtohide. Butthe teststheywere conducting onthe exhaustfumes, meantto prove thecleanlinessofmodern diesel engines, uncovered one ofthe biggestand boldestfraudsin corporate history. The decision byVW, a pillarofGermany’scarindustry, toﬁt“defeatdevices” and cheatemissionstestsin up to 11m carshasso farcostthecompany$21bn in ﬁnesand compensationin North America alone.Whydid the companydeliberatelysetoutto engineercarsthatspewed outup to35 timesmore poisonousnitrogen oxideson the road than stated in oﬃcial tests? JackEwing, a journalistforthe NewYorkTimes,oﬀersa timelyguide to the scandal, settingoutin detail whyVW’scorporate cultureled to the deception. He delvesinto VW’sorigins, whenAdolfHitlerordered the construction ofa“people’scar”, orVolkswagen in German.VWsetup shop in the German country-side. Wolfsburgbred a “headquartersmen-tality” thatinsulated the ﬁrm from outsideinﬂuence. Unprecedented union power,handed overin the 1960sasthe price thefederal governmentpaid forﬂoatingtheﬁrm on the stockmarket, and the sway ofthe state ofLowerSaxony, which retaineda20% votingstake in the company, gaveoutside shareholderslittle say. Thisallowed autocraticbossesto havetheirway. Ferdinand Piëch became chiefexecutive in 1993 ata time when the com-panywasstruggling. To win backsales, MrEwingargues, he created the conditionsthatallowed the fraud to “fester”. To keepworkersonside, the companyhad to carryon growing. Managerswere keptquietthrough fear. The ruthlessMrPiëch re-placed almostthe entire managementboard byhissecond yearin the job. HissuccessorasCEO, Martin Winter-korn, a man cutfrom the same cloth, want-ed the ﬁrm to become the world’sbiggestcarmaker. An assaulton the Americanmarket, where VWwasweakand emis-sionsregulationsmuch tighterthan in Eu-rope, wasvital to overtakingToyota andGeneral Motors. To meetthatdemandingtarget, though, VWhad to cheat.MrEwingexplainswhyVWcheated,butpinpointingwho wasresponsible hasbeen much harder. The companyinsiststhe deception wascooked up bymiddlemanagersand thatseniorbosses, despite areputation formicroscopicattention to de-tail, knewnothingofthe fraud until itwastoo late.

European customersare pursuingclass-action lawsuitsforcompensation,though VWinsistsitdid nothingwrong inEurope, where the rulesare laxer. Mr Piëchleftthe companybefore the scandal erupt-ed and MrWinterkorn hassince resigned.Several employeeshave been arrested orcharged with criminal oﬀencesin Ameri-ca. German prosecutorsare investigatingnearly40 employeesand have begun aprobe into MatthiasMüller, the latest CEOand anotherlong-servinginsider, for fail-ingto warn shareholdersin a timelyman-neraboutthe scandal.

Therehave been several versionsofhercollectedorcomplete poems, butnone hasquitedone herjustice. Until now. Why? Becauseshe wasalwaysﬁddlingwith herownwork, rewritingit, orleavingpoemsout altogether. Asshe aged, she tended tomake lightofherearlywork, orresketch itcompletely. Occasionally, these med-dlings—these wasplike buzzingsabout—could be injudicious. Moore wasnotthebestcustodian ofherown work. Atlast, acomplete collection—variantsand all—ofherwritings, from ﬁrstto last, has beenchronologicallyordered.Moore wasborn in Missouri in 1887, butby1918 had settled in NewYorkwith hermother. And there she stayed. She wouldnevermarry. Instead, she became the edi-torofthe Dial, an inﬂuential literary reviewofthe 1920s, and hertastesand herstrongopinionshelped to shape the read-inghabitsofgenerationsofpoetrylovers.Butitisasa poetthatshe standsalone.There isno one quite like her, no one towhom she could be compared, such isherrootednessin herown hugelyeccentricand wilful Moore-ishness.

Herpainstakingdescriptionsofthe odd char-acteristicsofsuch creatures(she had agreatfondnessforcompound adjectives)cause herpoemsto read attimeslike high-literaryglosseson David Attenborough’s“PlanetEarth” decadesbefore itstime. Sometimesitisdiﬃcultto tell exactlywhatshe iswritingaboutbecause her po-emsare alwaystackingsideways, reachingoutforevermore oddball compari-sons—on one occasion she likened Handelto a frigate pelican. Hermannerofwritingcan be positivelyJamesian in itsdegree ofverbal attentiveness. She peppered her po-emswith epigrams. She loved odd wordslike “picardel”—an Elizabethan ruﬀ. Andthe concludingline of“HalfDeity” reads:“Histalkwasasstrange asmygrandmoth-er’smuﬀ.” She would also add in, forgoodmeasure, a freightofquotationsfrom unusual sources: a magazine, say, oramemberofthe clergy.Asshe aged, herpoemsbecame moremoralistic, and Moore herselfbecame a literarycelebrity, seen abouttown in hercape and hertricorn hat. She ratheren-joyed it, and even played up to it. In 1955 theFord MotorCompanyasked herto suggestnamesfora newmodel. She opted forUto-pian Turtletop orMongoose Civique. Fordused Edsel instead. In 1968 she threwtheﬁrstpitch ofthe season atYankee Stadium.Baseball had engaged herbefore, asa poetratherthan a participant. “Baseball andWriting” waspublished in the NewYorkerin December1961. The poem beginslikethis: “Fanaticism? No. Writingisexciting/and baseball islike writing./Youcan nevertell with either/howitwill go/orwhat youwill do...” Moore please.7THE attackson the World Trade Centrein 2001; the Gujaratriotsof2002 thatleftsome 2,000 Muslimsdead; the fall ofthe Babri Masjid in Ayodhya in 1992; theimposition ofemergencyrule byIndiraGandhi in 1975; the partition ofIndia. Allthese political earthquakesmeritmentionin justthe ﬁrst50 pagesofArundhati Roy’snewnovel, “The MinistryofUtmostHap-piness”. Sometimestheypropel the actionforward. More often, aswith the attacks onthe twin towers, theyare simplythere, forno particularreason. Then there issocial justice: gender andidentityare atthe centre ofthisbook—or atleastin the ﬁrsthalf. Itstartswith the storyofAnjum, born with both male and fe-male genitals, who becomesa memberofSouth Asia’scommunityofhijras, thetranslation ofwhich isshiftingfrom “eu-nuch” to “transgender”. She iscaughtup inthe Gujaratriots, which setsoﬀa chain ofeventsthatlead to herleavinghercommu-nityand heradopted daughterto setuphome in a graveyard. Soon after, she all butdisappearsfrom the narrative.In herplace comesTilottama, a wild-haired Kerala Christian who hasstudiedarchitecture in NewDelhi and istranspar-entlymodelled on MsRoyherself. Tilot-tama isthe objectofaﬀection ofthree ofherclassmates: Naga, who becomesahigh-powered journalist, Biplab, an intelli-gence oﬃcer, and Musa, a Kashmiri mili-tant. She becomesinvolved in the Kashmirstruggle with Musa, then marriesNagaand eventuallyrentsa ﬂatfrom Biplab. ItisasifMsRoycould notdecide whichbookto write, so she wrote them both, andthen some. Notsatisﬁed with the horrorsofGujaratand Kashmir, MsRoyintroducesfurtherconﬂict. Connectingthese two dis-parate threadsisa baby, leftatone oftheanti-corruption ralliesin NewDelhi thatconvulsed Indian politicsin 2011. The Mao-ists, who seekthe violentoverthrowof thestate, playa walk-on role, too. Everysignif-icantpolitical eventormovementin mod-ern Indian historyseemsto ﬁnd a place inthissprawlingnovel. MsRoyhasspentthe two decadessinceherdebutnovel, “The God ofSmallThings”, which won the Bookerprize in1997, espousingall mannerofcauses. Shehasargued forindependence forKashmirand againstbuildingdams, reported fromthe Maoistjunglesofcentral India, andwritten anti-globalisation screedsinwhich economicgrowth ofanysortmustbe stopped. “Ministry” istwo decadesofpolemicdistilled into one book, with a superstructure ofﬁction to hold itall to-gether. Itdoesnotwork. The bestﬁction stripsawaythe unnec-essary, leavingitto the readerto ﬁnd mean-ingbetween the lines. MsRoydoesthe opposite. Even in the occasional sectionsofbrilliance, she feelsthe need to under-line everynuggetwith a “moral ofthestory”, hectoringthe readerinto submis-sion. Nordoesithelp thatthe writing itselfisoften clunky, overwroughtor awk-ward. The elaborate imageryshe conjuresup seemsto be there to showthatthis isaseriousworkofﬁction, butitdoesnot cohere into a whole. “Howto tell a shattered story?” writesTilottama, to-wardsthe end ofthe novel. “Byslowlybecomingeverybody.

ThisyoungBritish opera direc-torisknown forbeinga martinet, demand-ingmillisecond precision in co-ordinationbetween sightand sound. Butasthe creatorand leadingexponentofa new theatrical art-form, she demandsnothinglessofherself.Daughterofan organistfatherand anartistmother, MsJoneswassmitten by aproduction ofBenjamin Britten’s“PeterGrimes” when she wasten; an internshipatEnglish National Opera reinforced thatobsession. “I wasalwaysfascinated bytheidea ofa visual world and a musical worldcomingtogetherto make somethingelse,”she says. Workingon theatre projectsafter study-ingmodern languagesatOxford, she wasinvited to design a London production ofEngelbertHumperdinck’s“Hansel andGretel”. Forthisshe began experimentingwith a newtechnique, in the processstum-blingon itsdramaticpotential when it occurred to herthatthe famished protago-nistsin herproduction could be made toseem to eatthe scenery. In a subsequentproduction she discovered more comicpotential when, duringa tennismatch between two characters, the ball perfectlyaimed alongitswayward trajectorythanksto MsJones’stechnique.Thattechnique isbased on lightwhichshe projects, asin a ﬁlm, onto diﬀerentpartsofthe stage. She intensiﬁesthe dramabysynchronisingherprojected imagesmove-by-move, note-by-note, with themovementsofthe live performersonstage, and with the musicfrom the orches-tra. Herstarpiece isa production of the op-era thatOliverKnussen based on “Wherethe Wild ThingsAre” and “HiggletyPig-gletyPop!”, two whimsical talesbyMau-rice Sendak, a well-known American chil-dren’swriter. Here MsJonesexploitsthejuxtaposition ofthe real and the projectedin dozensofwittyways: a live characterkicksa projected doorwhich then obedi-entlyslamsshut, anothercharacterap-pearsto drawa giant(projected) lion andthen putsherhead in itsmouth. This isnotso much surrealism asthe heightened real-ityofthe child’s-eye viewofthe world.All thiswizardrycomesoutofMsJones’slaptop, overwhich she presideslike a concertpianist. The comparison isapposite. She constantlytalksof“playing”herproductions: combiningvideo andﬁlm software, the keyson hercomputercontrol all the diﬀerentfacetsofthe move-ment, colourand behaviourofthe lightthatisprojected onstage. And justas a pia-nistdependson muscle-memoryto jugglethousandsofnotesin a concerto, so MsJonesdependson thatsame facultyto syn-chronise herimageryﬂuentlyand ﬂexiblywith the singerson stage. Itcan take a yearforherﬁngersto learn to “play” a produc-tion. “Technologychanges, butideasdon’t,” she says. Itistypical ofthisrestlesslyproliﬁc di-rectorthatin the nextfortnightshe will beunveilingtwo newshowsalmostsimulta-neously. In the Norwegian cityofBergenshe will presentHandel’s“Messiah” withthe textin the original “blackletter” typo-graphyofthe KingJamesBible projectedonto an emptystage. Afewdayslater in theSnape Maltingshall nearAldeburgh, onEngland’seastcoast, she will premiere herproduction ofBenjamin Britten’stake onShakespeare’s“AMidsummerNight’sDream”. Magicisso integral to the playthat MsJonesregardsherown pyrotechnicsas sec-ondary. Those thatthere are will largely beconcentrated in the handsofOberon,whom she regardsasalmostpsychopathi-callycontrolling. In herview, histheft ofTytania’sbeloved Little Indian Boyis amoral outrage: “I see no charm in a ‘happy’endingwhere a man can manipulate awoman to such a degree thathe steals heradopted son afterdruggingher—especiallyasshe wasso close to the boy, whose moth-erhad died.” Unlike Britten’slibretto,where Oberon keepsthe boyforhimself,in thisreadingTytania getshim back.MsJones’sprojected imageryforthisstagingwill reﬂectbackon Snape itself anditssurroundings. The hall wasoriginallybuiltformaltingbarley, asthe ﬁrst stage inbrewingbeer, and itisone ofthe ﬁrst Vic-torian industrial buildingsto have beentransformed into a cultural space; it isstillsurrounded byrelicsofthe old machinery.Photosofthe original workersare so redo-lentofthe rough sonsofthe soil in Shake-speare’splaythattheyinspired ideas forthe staging. With imagesﬁlmed in andaround Snape, thisproduction will turn onthe visual contrastbetween the rusty andrusticon one hand, and the magical clean-nessofthe projected world on the other.The fairieswill merge with theirarborealbackground. Dotted through the reed-bedsofSnape are little oasesofwoodlandwhich have remained untouched forcen-turies. In a life ﬁlled with newtechnologyaswell asold, MsJoneshascaptured thesein the dreamystyle ofthe ﬁrstVictorian nature-photographers.7Modern operaMidsummerdreamingAn imaginative opera directorandvideo artistis reinventing storytellingArare moment of calm75The Economist June3rd2017DEPARTMENT OF CONCESSIONS, PROCUREMENT, EXPROPRIATION AND PRIVATIZATIONCONTRACT NOTIFICATIONName and address of the contractual authority: Ministry of Energy and IndustryBulevardi “Dëshmorët e Kombit”, phone number: +355 4 2222245;Name and address of the responsible person: Etleva Kondi, Ministry of Energy and Industry (e-mail: ervin.duraj@energjia.gov.al; cc: etleva.kondi@energjia.gov.al;Type of the contractual authority and the main activity or activities: Central Institution; Object of the contract: Provision through concession of the hydropower plant “Kalivac”;Duration of the contract: 35years;Location of the object of the contract: The construction of the hydropower plant of the type with a dam, that will be constructed near the village Kalivac, along the downstream of the River Vjosa, from the quota 113 m.a.s.l. up to the quota 73 m.a.s.l.;Legal, economic, fi nancial and technical information: Appendix no.9 of ToR;Criteria to select the winner: Appendix no. 10 of ToR;Time limit for the submission of the bids: Within and no later than: Date: 14/07/2017 At: 12:00 A.M;Time limit to open the bids: Within and no later than: Date:14/07/2017 At: 12:00 A.M;Period of the bids validity: 150 days;SECRETARY GENERALKOLI BELEREPUBLIC OF ALBANIAMINISTRY OF ENERGY AND INDUSTRYAdvertisement for Faculty Positions(Ref.

quantitative easing, including thecontinued purchasing of governmentbonds. In the euro area, an average of12% of government bonds were held bycentral banks last year. The OECD, a clubmostly of rich countries, cites a studywhich estimates that yields on Europeangovernment bonds have fallen by 13 basispoints as a result of these purchase pro-grammes. The Japanese central bankholds just under 40% of governmentbonds; it expects to continue to makepurchases equivalent to around 15% ofGDPa year, until inﬂation is safely abovethe price-stability target of 2%. 78The EconomistJune3rd2017THE invasion ofPanama bythe UnitedStatesin December1989 involved morethan 27,000 troops, a parachute assault,and tanks. Itwasthe biggestAmerican mil-itaryoperation since Vietnam. Manuel No-riega, Panama’sleader, soughtrefuge in theVatican nunciature in Panama City. Therethe yanquisbombarded him with non-stop heavy-metal music. Bludgeoned anddeafened byVan Halen and The Clash, heturned himselfin on January3rd. ThiswasOperation JustCause. Theproximate cause, asPresidentGeorge H.W.Bush explained it, wasGeneral Noriega’s“recklessthreats” againstAmericans.Some 35,000 American soldiersand civil-ianslived in the Canal Zone, a decade orsoafterithad been controversiallyhandedbackto Panamanian control. The UnitedStatesstill needed a strategicgrip on thecountry. Increasingly, italso had to keep agrip on the small, grinning, fatigues-clad,acne-scarred man (“Cara de Piña”, “Pine-apple Face”), who had run itabsolutely forsixyears, and de facto foreight. The reasonsfornabbinghim were notfarto seek. He had rigged presidential elec-tionsin 1984 and in October1989, when hesenthis“DignityBatallions” to beatbloodythe candidateswho had won. In1985 he had ordered the murder(“Whatdoyoudo with a rabid dog?”) ofanotherop-ponentwho wasfound, headless, in a USPostal Service mailbagon the Costa Ricanborder. Aftereach attempted coup againsthim, the leaderswere killed byﬁringsquad. He and hisassociateswere impli-cated in manymore killings, including thedeath ofhispredecessor, OmarTorrijos, inaplane crash in 1981; afterwhich “El Man”ashe called himself, gathered all powerinto hisclenched, raised ﬁsts. Asbad, though, in the eyesofthe Bushadministration washislivelyrole in thedrugstrade. Asthe cold warfaded, MrBush’sfocushad turned to the narcosofCentral and South America; and there,frontand centre, stood General Noriega.With hishelp, the Medellín cartel was us-ingPanama to ship Colombian cocaine tothe United States. Hisillicittakings fromthe business, asestimated when he was in-dicted fortraﬃckingand embezzlement infederal courtin Miami in 1988 and 1992,were atleast$772m, with perhaps$200m-300m forhimself. He laundered itthrough Panamanian and French banks;the French too broughtchargesagainsthim. The associateswho also “feasted atTony’stable”, asRadio Panama putitwhenhe died, no doubtdid aswell, “though theywill saytheydid notknowhim.” Some ofthe moneywaspassedthrough propertiesin Paris. Athome, heshowed fewsignsofthathigh life. He andhisfamilylived in a modesttwo-storeyhouse in a nice partoftown: already notbad fora slum boy, abandoned youngbyhisparents. With hismixed-race back-ground and darkskin, he pitched hisap-peal to the poorand “humble”; in hishigh-school yearbook, he wasalreadytipped tobe a workers’ leader. In perhapshismostfamousspeech, aftera cut-oﬀin Americanaid in 1988 had battered Panama’secon-omy, he urged the crowds, swinginga longmachete, “NotOne Step Back!” “¡Ni UnPaso Atrás!”—a phrase thatquicklywentup on billboardsall overPanama City. ACIAseductionIn the eyesofthe United States, GeneralNoriega had to go. The deed wasdone, andhe wastried, convicted and locked up ﬁrstin Florida, then France, then Panama. Butwhen hislawyersclaimed thathisindict-ment“smellsall the wayto Washington”,theywere notwrong.Foraslongasitsuited the Americans,the general wastheirasset. The CIArecruit-ed him asa fresh-eyed cadetin a Peruvianmilitaryacademy, and trained him incounter-insurgencyand jungle opsattheSchool ofthe Americasin Panama, run byAmericans. There he wastaughtmostly toﬁghtcommunists, atwhich he proved—hethought—notavid enough forhistrainers.Double-dealingwasmore hisstyle. Laterhe happilysold Panamanian passportsat$5,000 each to the Cuban government,while passingCuban secretsto the CIA. From 1967 to 1988, a yearbefore hisejec-tion, he wason the agency’spayroll—andpaid handsomely. DuringRonald Reagan’spresidency, he wasan invaluable conduitofcash and weaponsto the Nicaraguancontras. Ashead ofPanama’ssecretpoliceand head ofall itsdefence forcesfrom 1983,he could capablylend a hand, ashe of-fered, with sabotage and assassinations. Foralmostall thistime he wasalso as-sistingthe hemisphere’straﬃcin cocaine.He wasnotstopped. When he rigged theelectionsof1984, the United Statessaidnothing. He wastoo useful. Ittooka reportfrom the narcoticssubcommittee oftheSenate in 1988, pointingoutthatwilfullyturninga blind eye wasnotin America’snational interest, to change the wind. The man himselfshowed some contri-tion in prison, askingPanamaniansfor for-giveness(he found Jesusin 1990, thankstotwo pastorsfrom Texas). Towardsthe Un-ited States, though, he showed onlyde-ﬁance. He spent17 yearsthere asa prisoner-of-war, with two rooms, a TVand a tele-phone. Those privilegesdid notsoften thestill-rawhumiliation ofbeingdeposed, asjefeofhiscountry, bypeople he had helpedforyears. Whateverhisbrutalities, andtheywere many, Operation JustCausewas, in truth, Operation Save Face. 7From friend to foeManuel Antonio Noriega, strongman ofPanama, died on May29th, aged 83ObituaryManuel NoriegaVISIT THE SALES SUITE  +44 (0)20 3797 6809GOODLUCKHOPE.COMAPARTMENTS  FROM £335,000A NEW ISLAND DESTINATION — LAUNCHING 15 JUNECOMPUTER GENERATED IMAGE.
