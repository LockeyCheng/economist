The price paid forastockora bond should allow forhuman error, bad luckor, indeed, manythingsgoingwrong atonce. In a troubled world oftrade tiﬀsand nuclearbraggado-cio, such advice should be especiallyworth heeding. Yet rarelyhave so manyassetclasses—from stocksto bondsto propertyto bitcoins—exhibited such a sense ofinvulnerability.Dearassetsare hardlythe productofeuphoria. No onewould mistake the bloodlessrun-up in global stockmarkets,creditand propertyoverthe pasteightyearsfora reprise ofthe“roaring20s”, oreven an echo ofthe dotcom mania ofthe late1990s. Yetonlyatthe peakofthose two bubbleshasAmerica’sS&P 500 been higherasa multiple ofearningsmeasured overaten-yearcycle. Rarelyhave creditorsdemanded so little insur-ance againstdefault, even on the riskiest“junk” bonds. Andrarelyhave propertypricesaround the world towered so high.American house priceshave bounced backsince the ﬁnancialcrisisand are above theirlong-term average relative to rents.Those in Britain are well above it. And in Canada and Austra-lia, theyare in the stratosphere. Add to thisthe craze forexotica,such ascryptocurrencies(see Free exchange), and the world isin the throesofa bull marketin everything. Where’s the beef?Asset-price boomsare a source ofcheer, butalso anxiety. Thereare two immediate reasonsto worry. First, marketshave beensteadilyrisingagainsta backdrop ofextraordinarily loosemonetarypolicy. Central bankshave keptshort-term interestratesclose to zero since the ﬁnancial crisisof2007-08 and havehelped depresslong-term ratesbypurchasing$11trn-worth ofgovernmentbondsthrough quantitative easing. Onlynow aretheystartingto unwind these policies. The Federal Reserve hasraised ratestwice thisyearand will soon startto sell itsbond-holdings. Othercentral bankswill eventuallyfollow. Iftoday’sassetpriceshave been propped up bycentral-banklargesse, itsend could prompta bigcorrection. Second, signsare appearingthatfund managers, desperate forhigheryields, are becomingincreasinglyincautious. Consider, forinstance, investors’ re-centwillingnessto buyEurobondsissued byIraq, Ukraine andEgyptatyieldsofaround 7%. Butlookcarefullyatthe broaderpicture, and there issomelogicto the ongoingrise in assetprices. In partit isa response toan improvingworld economy. In the second quarterofthisyearglobal GDPgrewatitsfastestpace since 2010, asa recoveryin emergingmarketsadded impetusto longer-standingup-swingsin Europe and America. Asourspecial reportthis weekargues, emerging-marketeconomieshave come outoftestingtimesin farmore resilientshape. More signiﬁcantstill isthe behaviouroflong-term interestrates. Theyhave fallen steadilysince the 1980sand remainclose to historiclows. And thatunderpinsall sortsof otheras-setprices(see page 21). Awidespread concern isthatthe Fedand itspeershave grosslydistorted bond marketsand, byex-tension, the price ofall assets. Warren Buﬀett, the mostfamousdisciple ofBen Graham, said thisweekthatstockswould lookcheap in three years’ time ifinterestrateswere one percentage-pointhigher, butnotiftheywere three percentage points high-er. Butifinterestratesand bond yieldswere unjustiﬁably low,inﬂation would take oﬀ—and puzzlinglyithasn’t. Thissuggeststhatfactorsbeyond the realm ofmonetarypolicyhave been abiggercause oflowlong-term rates. The mostimportant isanincrease in the desire to save, asageingpopulations setaside alargershare ofincome forretirement. Justasthe supply ofsav-inghasrisen, demand forithasfallen. Stagnantwages and thelowerprice ofinvestmentgoodsmean companiesare ﬂushwith cash. All thissuggeststhatinterestrateswill staylowbyhistorical standards. Beware ofthe bullStill the mostdangerous, anti-Graham motto ofinvesting is“thistime isdiﬀerent”. Itwould be daftto assume thatassetpricesmustremain high come whatmay. Manyhazardscouldderail the economyand ﬁnancial markets, from a debt crisisinChina to an American-led trade waroran outbreakofﬁghtingon the Korean peninsula. And when the nextrecession comes,policymakershave lessﬁscal and monetaryammunition toﬁghtitthan theyhad in previousdownturns. Prudence there-fore suggestscaution.One option isforcentral bankersto raise ratesmore enthu-siasticallyand lesspredictably, to joltﬁnancial markets and re-mind investorsthatthe world isvolatile. Yetthere are obviousperilswith thiscourse. The tighteningmightprove excessive,tippingeconomiesinto recession. And with inﬂation in mostbigeconomiesbelowcentral bankers’ target, sharplyhigherratesare hard to square with theirmandate. Instead, caution callsforgradualism. To minimise disrup-tion, the reversal ofquantitative easingshould be stretchedout. The Federal Reserve hasseta good precedentbypropos-ingto reduce itsbondholdingsata leisurelypace and ﬂaggingthe change well in advance. When the time comes, itspeersshould followsuit. Ofthese, the European Central Bank facesthe trickiestchallenge, because ithasacted as, in eﬀect, thebackstop to euro-zone bond markets, a mechanism thatother-wise the currencyblocstill lacks. Butthe main safetyvalve lieselsewhere, with banks and in-vestors. Bitterexperience hasshown thatdebt-funded assetscan magnifylosses, causingﬁnancial crises. Forthis reasonbanksmustbe able to withstand anyreversal oftoday’shighassetpricesand lowdefaults. Thatmeansraisingbank capitalin placeswhere itistoo low, especiallythe euro zone, and notbackslidingon strenuous“stresstests” asAmerica’sTreasuryproposes. In the end, however, there maybe no escape forin-vestorsfrom the lowfuture returnsand even lossesthat highassetpricesimply. Theyand regulatorsshould take a leafoutof“The intelligentInvestor”, and make sure thattheyhave a mar-gin ofsafety.7The bull marketin everythingPrices are high across a range ofassets. Is ittime to worry? Leaders12LeadersThe EconomistOctober7th2017AFTERthe worstmassshoot-ingin recentAmerican his-tory, in which 58 people werekilled and 489 wounded, boththe presidentand the majorityleadersin Congresssoughttokeep talkaboutnewgun laws toaminimum. In Vegasthatkindofreticence iscalled a tell. Had Stephen Paddockused a newtechnology—an armed drone, say—to kill from the 32nd ﬂoorofthe MandalayBayhotel, orhad he been an immigrant fromthe Middle East, lawmakerswould be rushingto legislate ortighten borders. Buthe wasa retired white man who usedsome ofthe 49 gunshe owned, so itisthe price offreedom.There isa wearinessto America’sgun debate and the famil-iarritual aftermassshootings, which are more frequent thanin anyotherrich country. One studycounted 166 ofthem in 14countriesin 2000-14; 133 were in America. Yet, nothinghap-pens, partlybecause the National Riﬂe Association (NRA),which hasevolved from an armed version ofthe BoyScoutmovementinto the foremostmouthpiece fora viewofAmeri-ca in which everyone mustbe armed fortheirown protection,hasa veto in Washington—includingoverbanning“bumpstocks” which make semi-automaticgunsmore lethal.IfAmerica could notoverhaul itsgun lawsafterSandyHook, when 20 children aged sixand seven were shotatschool, then whatchance isthere now? And even iftighterlawson newgunswere introduced tomorrow, there wouldstill be a stockof300m ﬁrearmsto reckon with. Such despairisunworthyofthisweek’svictims. There areplentyofdown-is-up argumentsaboutguns, butthe Las Vegasshooting, in addition to beingthe mostdeadly, hasshown upthe old NRAline thatthe onlythingthatstopsa bad guy with agun isa good guywith a gun asthe mostdeceitful of the lot.Granted, America haschosen permissive gun lawsfor itself.Butthe bodycountdoesnothave to be ashigh asitis today. Re-search into murderand suicide suggeststhatmakingit justslightlyharderto gethold ofa weapon can reduce the numberofkillings, manyofwhich are spontaneousand unplanned.Itoughtto be possible to write lawsthatrespectthe righttobeararmswhile banningweaponsand modiﬁcationsthatmake itastonishinglyeasyto kill a lotofpeople quickly. MostAmericansfavoursuch lawsand would like universal back-ground checkson gun purchases, too (though supportfor guncontrol islessferventthan forgun rights). Such a regime wouldstill leave America with an unusuallyhigh numberofmur-ders, suicidesand fatal accidentsinvolvingguns, but the dis-paritywith othercountrieswould be lessglaring. The road from MandalayTired ofwaitingforCongress, some citieshave introducedtheirown laws. In upstate NewYork, where plentyofpeoplehunt, gun lawsare permissive. In NewYorkCitythose lawsdonotapply. Anyone who wantsto carrya gun down Fifth Ave-nue mustﬁrstobtain the permission ofthe NYPD. NewYorkstate tightened itslawsafterSandyHook, in eﬀectbanning as-saultweapons. Fourotherstatesdid the same, though a fur-ther16 responded bymakinggunseasierto buyorcarry.LasVegas, which sitsin a state with some ofthe loosestrulesin the country, should rewrite itsown gun laws, too. Realconservatives, who champion local ﬁxesforlocal problems,oughtto cheerthat. Ofcourse itwould notcompletely solvethe problem. Citieslike Chicago, nearstateswith permissivelaws, would still be ﬂooded with guns. Butin a country with30,000 gun deathsa year, even small improvementswouldsave a lotoflives. Arough calculation suggeststhat in the timebetween the LasVegasshootingand the publication of thisar-ticle, a further320 Americanslosttheirlife to a bullet. 7Guns in AmericaDeathlysilenceDo notdespair: change is possibleBYTHE time itsstop-start civilwarended in 2003, Liberiahad all butcollapsed.

Why,then, should women notreceivethe same salaries?” Thisques-tion wasasked in a circular sentbyequal-paysuﬀragettesto female teachersin NewYork’spublicschoolsin 1905. Atthe time, teachers’ startingannualsalarieswere setat$900 formen and $600 forwomen. In mostrich countriessuch outrightdiscrimination ishis-tory. Awoman doingthe same job forthe same employerearns98 centsto the dollarpaid to a man. Yetthe gender paygap persists. In the OECD, a club ofmostlyrich countries, themedian full-time wage forwomen is85% ofthatformen.Women earn lessthan men because theircareersdiﬀer intwo ways(see page 58). The occupationsthatmanyoptfor,such asteachingand nursing, are lesslucrative than those cho-sen bymen, perhapsbecause ofthe longhistoryofputting lessvalue on women’swork. And women paya high price formotherhood. Theyoften missa ﬁrstpromotion because theyare on maternityleave. Latertheytake lessdemanding jobswith poorprospects. Often theyare overqualiﬁed for theirnewrole, butsomebodyhasto pickthe kidsup from school. Itisnotthe place ofgovernmentsto tell youngpeople whatcareersto pursue, norto tell parentshowto divide their re-sponsibilities.

The ﬁrststep iswell-designed parental leave. In America,the onlyrich countrywith no such entitlementfornew moth-ers, manyofthem drop outofthe labourforce. Unlesssomeleave isreserved forfathers, asin Norwayand Sweden, cou-plestend to optforthe mother, who hasstayed home after thebirth, to take all ofit—especiallyifthe fatherisolder, and thusmore seniorand highlypaid.

Manyofthese policiescostmoney. Buttheyoﬀerhigh re-turns. Paternityleave hasbeen shown to make a father moreengaged throughouthischildren’supbringing, helpingthemto thrive.

Whateverthe provocation from Catalanleadersin stagingan unconstitutional poll, the reaction ofMar-iano Rajoy, the prime minister, hasthrown Spain into itsworstconstitutional crisissince an attempted coup in 1981. IfMrRajoythoughtthatcrackingheadswould puta stop tosecessionism, he could nothave been more wrong. He hasonlycreated a stand-oﬀthathasenergised hisenemies andshocked hisfriends(see page 49). On October3rd Catalonia,one ofSpain’srichestregions, wasparalysed bya proteststrike. Hundredsofthousandsofdemonstratorshavemarched to expresstheiroutrage. Secession would be a disasterforSpain. The country wouldlose itssecond cityand riskthe furtherlossofthe Basque re-gion. Secession would also hurtCatalans, which iswhy a ma-jorityofthem probablyoppose it. And Catalan independencemightstirup separatism elsewhere in Europe—in Scotlandagain, no doubt, butalso in northern Italy, in Corsica, perhapseven in Bavaria. To preventthe crisisdeepening, both sidesneed to seeka newconstitutional settlement. Instead, theyarediggingin and Catalonia ison the brinkofunilaterally—and il-legally—declaringindependence.AfterFrancoSpain hasa historical fearofdismemberment. Catalan seces-sionism wasone ofthe factorsthatbroughtaboutthe Spanishcivil warofthe 1930s. ManySpaniardsno doubtshare the an-gerofKingFelipe who, in a rare televised speech, denouncedCatalonia’sleadersforirresponsiblyand disloyallytearing upthe constitution of1978. Afterall, Catalansoverwhelminglyendorsed thatsettlement, which entrenched democracy,broughtprosperityand granted a large dose ofautonomy toSpanish regions, includingCatalonia.Awell-run democracymustabide bythe rule oflaw. Thatiswhatprotectsdemocraticliberties, notleastthe freedom ofmi-noritiesto expressdiscontent. Until referendum day, nobodywho experienced the vibrancyofBarcelona could seriouslyclaim thatCatalonia wasoppressed. With fewexceptions, no-tablywhen empirescollapse, the world generallyfavours na-tional unityoverself-determination bysubnational groups.Manyofthe statesliberated bythe break-up ofthe Soviet em-pire joined the European Union, butthese daysthe EU iswary,warningwould-be secessioniststhatnewstateshave no auto-maticrightto join. WithoutSpain’ssupport, Catalonia wouldﬁnd itselfon the wrongside ofa newcustomswall.Forall these reasonsthe Catalan leader, CarlesPuigdemont,doesnothave a strongcase forindependence. Norcan heclaim a real mandate. He rammed the lawsauthorisingthe ref-erendum through the Catalan parliamentwith a narrowma-jorityand withoutproperdebate. Those lawshave no formallegal standing. Before hisreferendum, opinion pollssuggestedthatonly40-45% ofCatalanswanted to breakaway. The 90%vote to leave was90% ofan unregistered turnoutofwell underhalf, because Catalonia’sRemainersmostlydeclined to takepart. Aswith populistselsewhere, MrPuigdemonthasoﬀeredasimplisticvision, withoutexplainingthe costsofindepen-dence orhowitmightcome about.Butthatisnotthe end ofthe story. Democracyrests on theconsentofthe governed. Even some who disagree with MrPuigdemont’smethodsbelieve Catalonia hasa case forna-tionhood. Itcould survive economically. Alotofits peoplethinkitconstitutesa nation. Underautonomy, Catalan leadershave promoted theirlanguage and theirnationalistcreed.The pain in SpainWhateverthe legalityofseparatism, once the desire for inde-pendence reachesa critical point, governmentsmustdeal withitin three ways: crush it, bowto it, ornegotiate in good faith,knowingthatseparation maystill be the outcome. MrRajoyhasfailed to grasp the nature ofthischoice. Firsthe blocked the nationalistsin the courtsand, lastweekend, heresorted to force. Hisdeploymentofpolicemen to suppress theCatalan vote wasnotonlya propaganda giftto them but, moreimportant, crossed a line. Aggression againstcrowdsof peace-ful citizensmayworkin Tibetbutcannotbe sustained in aWestern democracy. In the contestbetween formal justice andnatural justice, natural justice winseventuallyevery time.Constitutionsexistto serve citizens, notthe otherway around.Ratherthan uphold the rule oflawashe intended, Mr Rajoyended up tarnishingthe legitimacyofthe Spanish state.Will MrPuigdemontdeclare independence? Thatwould berecklessand irresponsible but, ifhe does, MrRajoyshould re-sistthe temptation to arrestCatalan leadersand, for the timebeing, avoid usinghispowerto suspend regional rule. Justnow, eithermeasure would onlycompound hismistakes. Onlya negotiation can restore calm and itshould start im-mediately. Even nowmostCatalanscan probablystill be wonoverwith the oﬀerofgreaterautonomy, includingthe powerto raise and keep more oftheirown taxes, more protection forthe Catalan language and some kind ofrecognition ofthe Cat-alansasa “nation”. MrRajoymighteven take up the opposi-tion Socialists’ idea ofturningSpain into a federal state. Anysettlement, though, mustinclude the option ofa refer-endum on independence. Separation would be a wrenchingchange forCatalonia and the restofSpain, so should notbedone lightly. AmajorityofCatalanseligible to vote should bethe minimum threshold forindependence. Afollow-up voteon the termsofa separation mightbe wise, too. Forall hisdeﬁciencies, David Cameron, the former Britishprime minister, wasrightaboutallowinga referendum onScottish independence in 2014. He made the case forScotlandto stay, and won the vote convincingly. MrRajoyshould do thesame. The case forthe unityofSpain isstrong. Butit mustbewon byforce ofargument. Byusingforce alone, MrRajoy isnotpreventingthe break-up ofSpain, buthasteningit. 7Separatism in CataloniaHowto save SpainCatalonia is on the brinkofdeclaring independence, butitis nottoo late to step backfrom calamityAsset ManagementWealth Management Asset ServicesHong Kong: +852 3191 1805Singapore:   +65 6536 1805group.pictet18The EconomistOctober7th2017Letters are welcome and should beaddressed to the Editor at The Economist, The Adelphi Building,1-11John Adam Street, London WC2N 6HTE-mail: letters@economist.comMore letters are available at:Economist.com/lettersFighting cancerThe oncologydrugpipeline isfull ofpromisingimmuno-therapiesand targeted treat-ments(TechnologyQuarterlyon cancer, September16th).Unfortunately, no one knowsthe optimal wayto use them.Doctorsand patientsalikestruggle with conﬂictingexpertopinionsand the informationoverload.

Over thepast136 yearsthe cyclicallyadjusted price-earningsratio (CAPE), a useful measure ofhowexpensive stockshave become, hasreached itscurrentheightsonlytwice be-fore: duringthe dotcom bubble; and justbefore the Crash of‘29. Whydoesthisremarkable surge notspurfranticenthusiasm—orforthatmatterdeep trepidation? One reason isthatinmostmarketbubblesyoucan pointto aparticulartype ofassetwhich isseeing itsprice rise inexorably: tech stocksin the1990s; housesin the mid-2000s. Today,though, America and much ofthe restofthe world are amid a bull marketin almosteverything: stocks, bondsand property areall strikinglyexpensive compared to long-term averages, and gettingmore so. Wheneverythingisgoingup, thingsare less excit-ing, and perhapslessworrying. Butitisstill a time to take care. The hun-gerforassetsthatisdrivingup prices isalsoleadinginvestorsto take more risks—riskswhich maynotbe fullypriced into their in-vestmentsand which theymaynotfullyunderstand, anymore than theyunder-stood the risksofmortgage-backed securi-tiesand otherinstrumentsin the run up tothe ﬁnancial crisisten yearsago. And theunderlyingdriverofthisoddlybroad bullmarket, lowlong-term real interestrates,hasconﬂictingexplanations—some com-parativelybenign, otherslessso.Startwith the evidence thatstocks aredear.

In countriesthat wereunscathed bythe global ﬁnancial crisis,such asCanada and Australia, housepricesare farabove theirlong-run average,relative to the costofrenting. In America,where house pricesplunged in the crisis,theyhave nowsurpassed theirpeakof2008 in nominal terms, and theyare backabove theirlong-run average relative torents. In Britain, propertypricesare close totheirpeakagainstboth average earningsand rents(see chart2 on nextpage). In bond marketscreditspreadshavenarrowed dramatically.

The borrow-ingcostsforprivate-equityﬁrmshavereached an all-time low. There isa keen ap-petite forinvestmentfundswith a technol-ogybent. SoftBank, a Japanese telecomscompanywith a sideline in venture capital(itwasan earlyinvestorin Alibaba, nowone ofChina’se-commerce giants), hasraised $93bn from assetmanagers, includ-ingsovereign-wealth funds, to putto workin youngtechnologyﬁrms. The keyassetprice, the one that setsthetone in othermarkets, isthe long-term in-terestrate. Long-term real interestrateshave been fallingsteadilysince the early1980s, and are nowathistoriclows(seechart4). The yield on a ten-yearTreasurybond fell close to 2% in the summer,though ithasrisen to 2.3% since. Allowforthe eﬀectsoffuture inﬂation, even ifitismodest, and the real return will be lowerstill. The interestrate on ten-yearinﬂation-protected bondsin America is0.5%. In Eu-rope real bond yieldsare negative.An interestrate isthe reward for forgo-ingspendingtoday, to consume tomorrow.When the desire to spend today’sincometomorrowincreases, interestratesfall. Thatmakespeople keen to ﬁnd otherwaysofstoringtheirspendingpower—and thusmore willingto paymore forotherassets. The reasonsforthe decadesofdeclinein real interestratesare notfullyunder-stood, and certainlynotagreed on. Diﬀer-entpeople give more orlessweightto threediﬀerentfactors: an increased appetite forsaving; a structural change in the econ-omy; and the actionsofcentral banks.What, ifanything, needsto be done de-pendsin large parton which factoryouchoose to give mostweightto. The more people wantto save, the low-erthe interestrate required to getthem todo so. And in pastdecadesvariousfactorshave been drivingup the propensitytosave. Ageingrich-world populationscameinto theirprime earningyears, and setaside more oftheirincome forretirement.BankofEngland economistsreckon thatthiseﬀecthaslowered the real interest rateworldwide by1.4 percentage pointssince1990. China’sintegration into the worldeconomyadded a lotofthriftypeople tothe world’spool ofsavers. In 2005, BenBernanke, then a governorofAmerica’sFederal Reserve and lateritschairman, at-tributed much ofthe worldwide “savingsglut” drivingdown interestratesto China.The inﬂuence ofassetpricesisstill evidentin the frothinessofpropertymarkets in cit-ieslike Londonand Vancouver, where theeagernessofChinese buyersdrivesawedge between house pricesand localfundamentals, such asrentsand income. Atthe same time asthe supplyof sav-ingshasrisen, the demand forinvestmenthasfallen. The trend growth rate ofrich-world economieshasbeen dropping. Thereal costofplantand machineryhasfallenand the value ofﬁrms, particularlyin thetechnologyindustry, hasshifted increas-inglyto intangible assetsratherthan physi-cal assets; both those thingsmean theamountofinvestmentneeded fora givenoutputhasfallen. So the corporate sectorendsup swimmingin cash, addingyetmore to the swollen supplyofsavings.The third factoristhe role ofcentralbanks. The reason long-term interestratesare low, the argumentgoes, isbecauseshort-term interestrateshave been keptlowfora longtime. Central bankshaveheld them close to zero foralmosta decade(longer, in Japan). Theyhave also pusheddown long-term interestratesmore di-rectlybybuying$11trn-worth ofgovern-mentbondsand otherassetssince2009—in partasan attemptto push inves-torsinto riskierassets, thusginning up theeconomy. Little wonderlong-term interestratesare low. Itisnotquite assimple asthat, comesthe response. Central banksare asmuchshaped byeconomictrendsasshapersofthem. The increased desire to save haschanged the termsofmonetarypolicy-making. Justasthe real rate ofinterest thatbalancesthe demand forlong-term savingwith supplyhasfallen, so hasthe “neutral”rate ofinterestwhich keepsinﬂation stablewhen the economyisatfull capacity. Ifthecentral bankswere reallykeepinginterestratesand bond yieldstoo low, the econ-omywould overheatand inﬂation wouldtake oﬀ. There isnotmuch evidence of this.In the absence ofinﬂation itis reason-able to expectlowinterestratesto persist,and thusunsurprisingthatthe prices ofstocks, corporate bondsand propertygoup. Ifthe yieldson risk-free bondsstay de-pressed, then the expected returnson allotherassets—the earningsyieldson equi-ties, say, orthe rental yield on houses—mustfall into line. In some waysthismakeshigh assetpriceslessworrying. Take stockprices. Tovalue the future earningsyoucan expectfrom owninga piece ofa company, theymustbe discounted usingan interestrate.Ifthe real interestrate islowerand lookslikelyto staythatway, discountrates willfall, too. Thatmakesfuture earnings morevaluable, and goessome wayto justifyingpayinga high price forthem. Thusin a low-interest-rate world those high CAPEnum-bersmake a lotmore sense.Aslogical asall thisseems, though,there isneverthelessa naggingsense that23From backyard to junkyardSources: Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis; national statistics offices; OECD; S&P; The EconomistUnited States, corporate-bond spreadsPercentage pointsHouse price to rents, long-run average=10019972000051015170510152025High-yieldInvestment-grade1980859095200005101750100150200250AustraliaCanadaBritainUnitedStates4Lack of interestSource: “Measuring the ’world’ real interest rate”, by M.

Whatif, forinstance, inﬂation issendinga false signal aboutwhere real in-terestratesshould be? Ifthatwere the case,central banksmightindeed be keepingrateslowerthan theyoughtto. Thisis thecase made recentlybyClaudio Borio, whoworksatthe BankforInternational Settle-ments(BIS), a clearinghouse forcentralbanksand a fontofcontrarian thinking. Central bankssteerbythe inﬂation rateasmarinerssteerbytheircompasses. Ifitrises, the economyisoverheatingand theship mustadjustitstrim. Ifitfalls, the econ-omyneedsa dose ofmonetarystimulus;the sailsmustbe unfurled. The problem,MrBorio says, isthatthe compassno lon-gerreadstrue.Globalisation, the decline ofunionpowerand technological change meanthatinﬂation doesnotperkup when thejoblessrate fallsin quite the wayit used to;the short-term trade-oﬀbetween inﬂationand the unemploymentrate, known asthePhillipsCurve, hasweakened to the pointofbreakdown. Inﬂation hasbeen de-pressed byreal factors, saysMrBorio. Bykeepinginterestrateslowin a vain attemptto ﬁne-tune it, central banksare insteadamplifyinga cycle ofboom and bust.Ifcentral banks’ inﬂuence on inﬂationhasbeen overstated, itmayalso be the casethattheirinﬂuence on the long-term realrate ofinterest, and thuson assetmarketsin general, hasbeen underestimated. Con-sideragain the decades-longdrop in inter-estratessince the 1980s; butthistime, in-stead ofaskingwhytheyfell, askwhy theystarted oﬀso high. One explanation is thesavage tighteningofmonetarypolicyun-derPaul Volcker, chairman ofthe Fed, whopushed short-term interestratesashigh as19% to crush America’sdouble-digitinﬂa-tion. The high real interestrate ofthe 1980sand 1990scarried the imprintofthe aggres-sive monetarypolicythatwentbefore.Thisepisode suggeststhatcentral bankscan indeed have a lastinginﬂuence on realinterestrates. Ifso, a decade ofaggressivelyloose monetarypolicymaywell haveweighed down bond-marketrates—andthus, fora while atleast, people’sidea ofthe neutral real rate. Indeed higherbondpricesmayhave induced some investors,such asinsurance funds, to themselvesbuymore bonds, drivingdown interestratesin a self-reinforcingspiral. Whatdoesthismean forthe future?One possibilityisthatthe spiral may gointo reverse ascentral banks, led by theFed, startto unwind the bond holdingstheyhave builtup. In the pastﬁve years thebondsissued bygovernmentsin America,the euro zone, Japan and Britain to ﬁnancebudgetdeﬁcitshave been broadlymatched bythe big-fourcentral banks’bond purchases. Believingthatthe worldeconomynowhassuﬃcientmomentumto slough oﬀthe legacyofitspastdebts, theFed isstartingto unwind itsshare in this.Though the European Central Bankandthe BankofJapan are, fornow, still buying,theywill in time followsuit. The Fed’seconomistsestimate thatitsassetpurchaseshave reduced the interestrateson ten-yearbondsbyone percentagepoint, and thatgettingitsbond holdingsbackto a normal level mighthave a similareﬀectin the opposite direction. The Fedwill sell bondsmuch more slowlythan itboughtthem to tryand ensure a smoothadjustmentto the market. Butthatcannotbe guaranteed. Hyun SongShin ofthe BISrecentlywarned ofthe perilsofa possible“snapback” in global bond yieldsif, for in-stance, some investorsstartdumpingbondsasyieldsrise, justastheysnappedthem up asyieldsfell. The pricesof otherassets, such asstocks, mightalso lose sup-port. Indeed, the pricesofotherassetsmightbe more destabilised than those inthe bond marketsthemselves. Into the greatwide openAnd whatofcentral-bankinterest-ratepolicies? The banks’ choice ofwhatto aimforastheycautiouslystartto tighten willbe made more vexed byindicationsthatthe increased propensityforsaving, is itselfin the processofturninground. China’scurrent-accountsurplus(a measure of itsexcesssaving) narrowed from 10% ofGDPin 2007 to under2% ofGDPin 2016. In a re-centpaper, CharlesGoodhartofthe Lon-don School ofEconomicsand Manoj Prad-han ofTalkingHeadsMacro, a researchﬁrm, argue thatthe rich world’sdemogra-phyisata turningpoint, too, with the shareofworking-age people in the populationaboutto fall (see chart5). Thatimplieslesssavingforretirementand more spendingin retirement. In a recentlecture atthe IMF,MarkCarney, the governorofthe Bank ofEngland, said thatthe neutral interest ratemaybe risingworldwide, “meaningthatmonetarypolicyhasto move in ordertostand still”.Who should worryaboutthis? Oneviewisthat, because stockmarketboomstend to end badly, policymakersshouldtake deliberate action nowto deﬂate pricesbefore itistoo late. Itisoften said that cen-tral banks, notablythe Fed, mollycoddlemarketsbydelayinginterest-rate riseswhile theyare unsettled. Ifthe Fed werelessconsiderate, assetpriceswould bejumpier, makinginvestorsmore attuned tothe inherentriskinessoftheirportfolios. Forsome tastes, thiscomesclose to ar-guingthatthe Fed hasto destroythe recov-eryin orderto save it; the steep rise in thefederal fundsrate required to bringAmeri-can share pricesto earth mighttip the econ-omyinto recession. And central banks stillhave some purchase on inﬂation: iftheyraise ratestoo much, theymightentrenchtoday’slowinﬂation, orriskdeﬂation. There isa bettercase fora less astrin-gentform ofintervention. Itsays, broadly,thatthe stockmarketisa sideshow. Hardlyanycapital isallocated with reference tostockvalues, since IPOsare so scarce. Whatmattersto the economyare banksand (inAmerica, atleast) creditmarkets. ResearchbyJeremyStein ofHarvard University andtwo co-authorsatthe Fed (where MrSteinwasonce a governor) hasfound thatwhenthe mood in creditmarketsisbullish (ie,corporate-bond spreadsare unusuallynar-rowand the share ofjunk-bond issuancehigh), the economywill soon suﬀer, withan abrupttighteningofcreditand slowergrowth. Given thisﬁnding, saysMrStein,“I’m waryoftargetinginﬂation so aggres-sivelythatyouare notmindful ofthe risksfrom bullish sentiment.”Itisthe nature ofinvestmentthat someriskybetswill notpayoﬀ. Ifportfolio man-agerswake up in two yearsregretting thehigh price theypaid forsharesin one techgiantoranother, orwishingtheydidn’town a 98-yeardollarbond issued byAr-gentina, so be it. The least—and perhapsthe best—thatcan be done isto ensure thatthe real economyisprotected shouldpricessuddenlyfall. Thatmeansguardingagainstpurchasesmade with too muchborrowed moneyofilliquid assets, espe-ciallyproperty. Italso meansensuringbankshave enough capital to withstand acorrection in assetprices. The policy toolsalreadyexistto do this. Nowisa good timeto putthem to work. 75Shy and retiringSource: UN World Population Prospects*Aged 15-64Working-age* population as % of total50556065701950607080902000102030FORECAST40World High-incomecountriesMiddle- andlow-incomecountriesThe EconomistOctober7th201725For daily analysis and debate on Asia, visitEconomist.com/asia1WITH an eagersmile and onlya fewtuftsofhairon hischin, Ibrahim, a30-year-old protesterin Jakarta, does notseem like much ofa Muslim ﬁrebrand.

When campaigninghe emphasised hisprobityand humility.He promised to improve crumblingroads,portsand airports, remove graftfrom poli-ticsand boostforeign investment.

DuringAhok’scampaign forgovernor,Islamistactivistspilloried him forhis reli-gion. And theyclaimed, misleadingly, thathe had criticised the Koran. Asa result, he isnowservinga two-yearsentence forblas-phemy. Agroup called the IslamicDefend-ersFront, which wasbehind the rally onSeptember29th, organised huge protestsagainsthim. Theyare notthe onlyreligiousagitators. In Augustin EastJava a 30-metrestatue ofGuan Yu, a Chinese deity, waspartiallycovered with a white sheetafterlocal Muslimsthreatened to tearitdown. Accordingto the Institute ofSouth-EastAsian Studiesin Singapore, mostMuslimIndonesianstake a relaxed approach tocertain aspectsoftheirreligion, such asgo-ingon the haj(only11% saythatisextreme-lyimportant). In otherareas, however,theyappearto be more doctrinaire: themajoritythinkthatwomen should wear ahijab and 67% thinkthatinstitutingshariawould “strengthen moral values”. Reli-giousviolence surged afterthe overthrowofSuharto, Indonesia’slong-servingstrongman, in 1998, butthen appeared todissipate; itisagain becomingmore com-mon. “Itisquite clearthatthere is a rise oftribalism acrossthe world and we are notimmune from it,” saysTom Lembong, thehead ofthe investment-promotion agency.Yetreligion would notbe such a handy uploadsshortclipson YouTube, makinghim seem farmore accessible than mostpoliticians.

China Construction Bank (CCB), which over sixty years has diversiﬁ ed rapidly across sectors and countries, is well positioned to capitalise on this. It continues to serve the real economy while progressing with long-term plans to transform digitally and expand its global footprint.Over the past year CCB, one of China’s “Big Four” banks, has also beefed up its overall risk prevention and control, which allowed it to improve performance. In the ﬁ rst half of 2017, net proﬁ t rose by 3.81% year-on-year to RMB139.01bn (US$21.31bn). Meanwhile, total assets grew by 3.47% from the end of 2016 to RMB21.69trn (US$3.32trn).FUELLING THE REAL ECONOMY, NEAR AND FAR, BIG AND SMALLCCB has been an important ﬁ nancial pillar for major national and international initiatives, including the “Belt and Road Initiative”, as well as the development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Xiong’an New Area. By the end of June infrastructure loans amounted to RMB3.22trn (US$493.69bn) or 50.78% of corporate loans and advances. Agricultural loans totalled RMB1.72trn (US$263.77bn). Meanwhile, residential mortgage loans increased by 9.50% since the end of 2016 to RMB3.93trn (US$601.24bn). Yet even as CCB extended loans to productive sectors of the economy, it continued to act as a responsible ﬁ nancial steward, by actively controlling loans to ﬁ ve industries plagued by overcapacity: iron and steel, cement, electrolytic aluminium, plate glass and shipbuilding. CCB has always believed that it is not just major corporations, but small businesses that drive economic development. By the end of June, loans to 397,400 diﬀ erent small and micro enterprises reached RMB1.49trn (US$228.18bn).CONSTANT INNOVATION AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENT CCB has introduced a number of measures to identify, assess and mitigate risks more scientiﬁ cally, detect risks upfront, improve the cooperative risk-prevention and -management system, and manage liquidity more precisely. At the end of June, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio stood at 1.51%, a slight decrease from 2016.CCB has also harnessed information technology and product innovation to support its ongoing transformation to an international, digital organisation. CCB successfully developed its new generation core banking system, improved its mobile ﬁ nancial products, and promoted the “Long Card” payment system, which integrates cross-border accounts in China and Hong Kong.CCB has accelerated its channel transformation. The number of personal online banking users, mobile banking users and WeChat banking users surpassed 250m, 240m and 62m, respectively. A RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZEN RENOWNED THE WORLD OVER CCB plays an active role in sponsoring social initiatives in education, healthcare and environmental protection. It has made great strides in its poverty alleviation projects, partly by issuing poverty alleviation bonds and creating targeted poverty alleviation platforms.CCB has continued to expand across the globe. CCB Indonesia was inaugurated in February 2017, followed by CCB Malaysia. New branches opened in Perth, Australia  and Warsaw, Poland. At the end of June, CCB had a total of 251 overseas branches in 29 countries and regions. In the ﬁ rst half of 2017, the net proﬁ t of these overseas commercial banks grew 86.70% year-on-year to RMB5.43 billion (US$0.83bn).With such stellar growth, it is no surprise that clients around the world consider CCB as their ﬁ rst port of call for all their banking and ﬁ nancial needs.ADVERTISEMENTTRANSFORMATION OF A BANKING GIANT TO SERVE BOTH THE TRADITIONAL AND DIGITAL ECONOMIES  28AsiaThe EconomistOctober7th2017India’s economyFifth columnistsSINCE leadinghispartyto a landslidevictoryin 2014 Narendra Modi, India’sprime minister, hasromped fromstrength to strength.

He isrightaboutthe staggeringgrowth. The numberofchildren the aver-age Australian woman hasfell belowtwoin the 1970sand hasstayed there. Yetsincethen Australia’spopulation hasgrown by70%, thanksalmostentirelyto immigra-tion. Over28% oftoday’sresidentswereborn overseas—a highershare than in Can-ada orNewZealand, letalone Britain orAmerica. The numberofnewcomerscon-tinuesto grow. Netoverseasmigration (ameasure ofimmigrantsminusdepartingAussies) hasnearlydoubled since 2000.MrSmith isalso rightaboutthe declinein livingstandards, albeitonlyrecently.Wage growth hasbeen draggingalongat itslowestrate in almost20 years, and dippedbelowinﬂation earlierthisyear, meaningthatthe typical workerislosingpurchasingpower. Although the unemploymentrate,at5.6%, islowbythe standardsofrecent de-cades, underemploymentisclose to a re-cord. Philip Lowe, the governorofthe Re-serve BankofAustralia, the central bank,concedesthatemployees“feel like there ismore competition” and are worried about“foreignersand robots”.Yet, to the frustration ofalarmists likeMrSmith, relativelyfewAustraliansseemto thinkthe wayto boosttheirincomes istostem the inﬂuxofimmigrants. In 2015 Gal-lup, a pollster, found thatAustralia wastheonlybigWestern countrywhere more peo-ple thoughtimmigration should rise (30%)than thoughtitshould fall (25%). Regularsurveysconducted bythe Scanlon Foun-dation, which worksto integrate immi-grants, showthatthe sense thatimmigra-tion istoo high hasfallen substantiallysince the 1990s. Pauline Hanson, a populistsenatorwho made hername then, warn-ingthatAustralia would be “swamped” byAsians, hasstarted fulminatingabout Mus-limsinstead, to little avail. When she re-centlytried to stirup publicopinion bywearinga burqa in parliament, she attract-ed more ridicule than adulation.In part, thatisbecause Australia hasalonghistoryofimmigration, from Chinesejoiningthe gold rushesofthe 1850sand1860sto Afghan camel drivershelping toexplore the outbackin the late nineteenthcentury. Ithelps, too, thatthe economy hasbeen growingfor26 yearswithouta reces-sion, and thatincomeshave been growingfasterthan the population. In fact, immi-grantshave had a hand in that: a growingpopulation consumesmore goodsand ser-vices. Recentimmigrantshave provided la-bourfora miningboom and, when that pe-tered out, demand forhousingandmanpowerto build it, helpingto keep theeconomytickingover. Some 600,000 for-eignersspentA$20bn ($14.6bn) to attendAustralian schoolsand universitieslastyear, makingeducation the country’sthird-biggestexport. Manytake local jobsand paytaxesaftertheygraduate.Itistrue thatimmigration appears tohave raised unemploymentand loweredwagesin certain industries. Bob Birrell ofthe Australian Population Research Insti-tute notesthatAustralia’spoints-basedsystem, which isdesigned to attractwork-erswith skillsthatare in shortsupply, hasbroughta deluge ofaccountantsand ITprofessionals. Overhalfofforeign stu-dentsstudybusinessand commerce be-cause theybelieve thatwill give them ac-cessto high-payingjobs, he says, but theyare often lefton “the fringesofthe labourmarketbecause it’sdiﬃcultto competewith locals”.

Interestin the Catalonian stand-oﬀ isperhapsto be expected. Afterall, the disputed vote on indepen-dence on October1st, which the Spanish authoritiesdid theirdamnedestto stop, hasshaken Europe. More strikingisthat, in amedia landscape more given to trivia and sensationalism, For-mosa Television, whose viewersfavourformal independence forTaiwan, senta ﬁlm crewto provide in-depth coverage of Kurdis-tan’svote lastmonth on secedingfrom Iraq.Small, pluckypeoplesseekingindependence: Taiwan fallsinto the category. Itisa model ofself-determination, peace andthe promotion ofhuman rights—the core principlesofthe UN.Formerlya thuggish one-partydictatorship undermartial law,overthree decadesTaiwan hastransformed itselfinto a vibrantdemocracythatisnotable forbeingdecent, prosperousand civil,albeitwith wildlyrumbustiouspolitics. Whatismore, by almostanymeasure, Taiwan isalready, in eﬀect, a sovereign country. Itelectsitsown president, raisesitsown armyand pursues itsownforeign policy—dream on Catalonia. Yet, like Catalonia and Kur-distan, itfeelsshort-changed, denied international recognitionand a sense ofitsrightful statusin the world.The reason, ofcourse, isChina. Communistdogma views Tai-wan asthe home ofa regime thatwastoppled in 1949 and thatitstill seesasillegitimate. Taiwan’sreturn to the fold, byforce ifnec-essary, isan integral partofthe party’scherished goal ofmakingChina whole again, asitseesit. Butthe dogma ismisleading. Forone thing, Taiwan did notbreakawayfrom China. Arguably, itisthe reverse: the Communistsrebelled againstKuomintang (KMT)led byChiangKai-shek, leavinghim in charge onlyofthe island,the one partofChina theyhave neverruled.Yetsince 1971, when the People’sRepublicofChina (ie, theCommunistsin Beijing) tookoverChina’sseatatthe UN from theRepublicofChina (ie, the KMTin Taipei), China hasdone its ut-mostto shrinkthe international space in which Taiwan may op-erate. Itdoesthison the basisofthe “one China principle”—thatsince there isonlyone China, countriesseekingrelations withChina mustbreakoﬀrelationswith Taiwan. Thisisan anachro-nism, harkingbackto the dayswhen Chiangstill sought uniﬁca-tion on the KMT’sterms. Thatfantasynowexistsonlyamong afewdiehards. These daysgovernmentsin Taiwan, including KMTones, claim to rule onlyforTaiwan, notforall ofChina.Regardless, China’shoundingofTaiwan isrelentless. The is-land isdown to 20 diplomaticallies, the mostsigniﬁcant ofwhich isprobablythe Vatican. The mostrecentcountryto bepeeled awaybyChinese promisesofjuicyinfrastructure projectsand softloansisPanama, which switched allegiance in June. Anunspoken diplomatic“truce” had prevailed while the KMT’sMaYing-jeouwaspresidentin 2008-16. He wasviewed in Beijingassympatheticto eventual reuniﬁcation. Butsince the landslidepresidential victorylastyearofTsai Ing-wen, whose DemocraticProgressive Party(DPP) hasstrongpro-independence elements,Taiwan isbackin the doghouse—despite MsTsai’smoderationand decliningpopularity—and the truce appearsto be oﬀ.Chinese pressure ensuresthatTaiwan isincreasinglyexcludedeven from international forumswhere ithassomethingto oﬀer.The WHO, forinstance, did notinvite Taiwan to attend thisyear’sWorld Health Assembly, where ithad been an observersince2009. Ata multilateral conference hosted byAustralia on conﬂictdiamondsin May, Chinese diplomatsboorishlyinterrupted anAboriginal welcome ceremonyto protestagainstthe presence ofaTaiwanese delegation, which had to leave.Earlierattemptsto join the UNnotasthe RepublicofChinabutsimplyas“Taiwan”, made bya previousDPP president, ChenShui-bian, an independence ﬁrebrand, have been quietlydropped byMsTsai. She hasalso fended oﬀcallsto make iteasierto hold a referendum on independence—despite a recenthungerstrike bysome pro-independence types. Afterall, justas anyat-temptata referendum in TibetorXinjiangwould be met withwholesale repression, so China hintsitmaycounterany referen-dum in Taiwan with force.Suﬀerwhatyou mustAnd so, asBrian ChristopherJonesofthe Universityof Dundeeputsit, despite 30 yearsofdemocracy, Taiwan remainsasvulner-able asever, protected militarilybyAmerica butleftundefendeddiplomaticallybymostofthe world. Regrettably, thatwill notchange soon. Itisnotjustbecause ofChina’sgrowingcloutinshapingitsenvironmentto itsliking. America, too, under DonaldTrump hasturned awayfrom promotingthe human rightsanddemocraticvaluesofwhich Taiwan isa beacon.

Colin Powell neverhad the earofGeorge W. Bush, and often feltbruised andfrustrated asa consequence. John Kerry, tohisdismay, wasoften leftoutofthe loop byBarackObama’smicromanagingWhiteHouse. Butthere isnothingnormal aboutthe wayDonald Trump haspubliclyscorned hissecretaryofstate, RexTiller-son, forholdingoutthe possibilityof talkswith North Korea overitsmissile and nuc-learprogrammes. Writingon Twitter, MrTrump declared thathe had told MrTiller-son thathe was“wastinghistime trying tonegotiate with Little RocketMan [NorthKorea’sleader, Kim JongUn]…Save yourenergyRex, we’ll do whathasto be done.” Whatprompted thisoutburstwasaconversation between MrTillerson and re-porterswho were travellingwith him toBeijingformeetingswith the Chinese lead-ership. MrTillerson had said he was“prob-ing” the possibilityofstartingup talks withNorth Korea aboutitsprogrammes. “Wehave a couple, three channelsopen toPyongyang,” he added. “We can talktothem, we do talkto them.”There wasnothingsurprisingaboutthis. While America lacksformal dip-lomaticrelationswith North Korea, mes-sagesare conveyed through the Swedishembassyin Pyongyang, which providesaconsularservice forUScitizens. Anotherchannel isthe North Korean mission to theUNin NewYork. There are also so-calledTrackII meetings(involvingacademic ex-pertsand formeroﬃcials), which can beused to gauge whetherthere isanybasisformore formal diplomaticapproaches.NorwasMrTillerson sayinganythingnewwhen suggestingthathe would be in-terested in startinga dialogue with Pyong-yang: he made similarremarksa fewweeksago. Ignoringthe president’stweets,JamesMattis, the defence secretary, reiter-ated hissupportforMrTillerson’s“eﬀortsto ﬁnd a diplomaticsolution” in a state-mentto the Senate Armed ServicesCom-mittee on October3rd. Given thatNorth Korea itselfshows noinclination to begin denuclearisation talkswith America and will probablyconsideratestingfreeze onlyonce ithasa demon-strable capabilityto threaten mainlandAmerica with thermonuclearattack, itmightseem reasonable to concede that MrTrump had a point. Some, perhapsinclud-ingMrTrump, mayeven believe thatthepresidentwasskilfullypursuingRichardNixon’s“madman theory”: the idea that ifyouconvince youradversariesthatyouare suﬃcientlyunhinged to do almost any-thing, includingstartinga nuclearwar,theyare more likelyto bend to yourwill.Unfortunately, historysuggeststhat MrNixon’sapplication ofthe theoryin rela-tion to Vietnam exposed the world to theriskofa nuclearcatastrophe withoutachievingmuch in return. AsfarasNorthKorea isconcerned, MrTrump issending amessage to MrKim, to the Chinese, whosehelp MrTillerson istryingto enlist, and toAmerica’sregional alliesthatinvestinganyhope in attemptingto de-escalate thecrisisispointless. IfMrKim believes thathe will be attacked come whatmay, eﬀec-tive deterrence isundermined, while noth-ingMrTillerson saysordoesneed be takenseriouslybyanybody, friend orfoe.Crawling backto youMrTillerson deservesonlyslightsympa-thy.

Voterschose them re-soundingly; when theytookoﬃce in early2011, theysetoutto return the favour.Armed with censusdata, Republican law-makersdrewdistrictsto maximise theirpolitical advantage. In the 2012 elections,Republicanswon 48.6% ofthe vote buttook60 ofthe state assembly’s99 seats. In2014 and 2016, their52% ofthe vote gotthem 63 and 64 seats.Some Wisconsinitesdecided thiscrossed the line from routine partisan ac-tivityto somethingmore sinister. Theysued the state, arguingthatitspartisangerrymanderwasso extreme thatitviolat-ed theirFirstAmendmentrightsto associa-tion and free speech and the “one person,one vote” principle enshrined in the Four-teenth Amendment’sequal-protectionclause. Afederal districtcourtupheld theircase in a divided ruling; the state appealedto the United StatesSupreme Court, whichheard argumentson October3rd. Gerrymanderingishardlynew: thename datesbackto an unwieldydistrictcreated in 1812 byElbridge Gerry, then go-vernorofMassachusetts. In moststates,the legislature controlsredistricting. Sixstatesuse independentcommissions, andlimitorbarelected oﬃcials, legislative staﬀorlobbyistsfrom servingon them. Unsur-prisingly, these statesseem to drawmorecompetitive districts. Elsewhere, new soft-ware and reamsofvoterdata nowallowpoliticiansto drawsurgicallyprecise maps,while increasingpolarisation hasuppedthe stakes. Asthe plaintiﬀ’slawyerquipped, “Gerrymandersnoware notyourfather’sgerrymander.”Contemporarygerrymanderscan com-pound Democrats’ geography-driven dis-advantages. Democratstend to live clus-tered in cities, while Republicanssprawlacrossmore heterogenousdistricts. Thisprobablycontributesmore to polarisationthan gerrymanderingdoes. Jowei Chen, apolitical scientistatthe University ofMich-igan, hasfound thatin manystates, evenwithoutintentional gerrymandering,Democratswould still win fewerthan 50%ofseatswith 50% ofthe vote. Buthe alsofound thatWisconsin’smap gerryman-dered farbeyond expectations.NorisWisconsin the onlystate whereRepublicansdrewgrosslycontorted maps.In Pennsylvania ﬁve yearsago, Republi-canswon 13 of18 House seatswith just49%ofthe statewide vote. North Carolina’smap givesRepublicansten seatsandDemocratsthree, despite close statewidevotes. When asked why, a Republican law-makerwho headed the redistrictingpro-cesssaid, “Because I do notbelieve it’spos-sible to drawa map with 11Republicansand two Democrats.” And in Maryland,Republicansclaim the state’sDemocraticlegislature gerrymandered theirrightsawayin the rural sixth congressional dis-trict. Votersin all three stateshave chal-lenged the mapsin court.Wisconsin’scase isunusual because itcould resultin a rulingthatapplies nation-wide. Atthe Supreme Court, both sidesaimed theirarguments—asso often hap-pensthese days—atAnthonyKennedy, theperpetual swingvote, poised between aquartetofliberals, who are probably moreeagerto invalidate Wisconsin’smap thanthe court’sfourconservative justicesare. InVieth vJubelirer, a gerrymanderingcasefrom 2004, fourjusticesrejected the notionthatcourtswere equipped to monitorpar-tisan gerrymanderingatall. Fourothersﬂoated a quartetofstandardsto do justthat. MrKennedy, asusual, splitthe diﬀer-ence. None ofthe standardsoﬀered avoid-ed “substantial intrusion into the nation’spolitical life”, he wrote in a concurrence.Butcurbson gerrymanderingmaybe im-posed “ifsome limited and precise ratio-nale” one dayemerges.The plaintiﬀsclaim thatdayhas ar-rived. “Social-science toolsnowallowcourtsto diagnose partisan gerrymanderswith accuracyand precision,” accordingtoabrieffrom two political scientists whohave helped drawdistrictmaps. Atissue is“partisan symmetry”—the intuitive notionthatpolitical partiesshould derive roughlythe same legislative representation fromequivalentpopularsupport. One wayto measure symmetry, oritsabsence, isthrough the “eﬃciencygap”, ameasure developed byEricMcGhee, a po-litical scientist, and NicholasStephano-poulous, a lawprofessor. Thisdeemseveryvote castfora losingcandidate, aswell asvotescastfora winnerin excessofwhat heneedsto win, to be wasted. Apartisan ger-rymandertriesto maximise the oppo-nent’swasted votesby“packing” and“cracking”—creatinga fewsafe districtsthattheywin overwhelmingly, whilespreadingthe restoftheirvotersas thinlyaspossible. Addingup all a party’swastedvotes, and dividingthatsum bythe totalnumberofvotescast, yieldsan eﬃciencygap. An eﬃciencygap largerthan 7% mayshowthatone partyholdsan unconstitu-tional “systemicadvantage” overthe other. Between the 1970sand 1990s, Wiscon-sin’sstate-assemblymapsaveraged an eﬃ-ciencygap of1.5% in Republicans’ favour.In the three electionssince 2010, thatﬁgurerose to 12.3%—meaningthatwinninghalfthe popularvote would have given Repub-licansmore than 60% ofthe seatsin Wis-consin’sstate assembly.The conservative judgesseemed unim-pressed. John Roberts, the chiefjustice,hoarilydismissed thismathsas“sociologi-cal gobbledygook”. Samuel Alito alsosneered, suggestingthata single paper bya“youngresearcher” hardlyprovidesan ad-equate basisforthe justicesto meddle inelectionsacrossthe country. And Neil Gor-such, the newestjustice, used a hokey riﬀon hissteakseasoningto deride the plaint-iﬀs’ approach as“a pinch ofthis, a pinch ofthat”, with too little guidance forhow toapplythe testin practice. MrKennedy didnotjoin hiscolleagues’ attackon the socialsciences. Earlierin the hearinghe askedWisconsin’slawyersa seriesofcriticalquestions, which mightindicate thathe fa-voursthe plaintiﬀs.Runnin’ down a dreamThe courtnowfacesan unenviable deci-sion. Lettingthe map stand could, as theplaintiﬀ’slawyerwarned, give states“afree pass” to create mapsthat, in eﬀect,“nullifydemocracy”. Butinterveningcould, asMrRobertsfears, push the courtdirectlyinto the political fray, risking whathe described as“seriousharm to the statusand integrity” ofhiscourt.Ofcourse, the courtcould always ruleon narrowergrounds, asitoften prefers todo. Itcould ﬁnd thatthe appellants lackstandingto sue, orrule thatWisconsin’smap wasuniquelyawful, butabstain fromdecidinga universal standard. Usually itprefersleavingpolitical questionsto vot-ers. Ifonlyelected oﬃcialsshowed suchconcern forthe popularwill.7Electoral mapmakingWhen politicians choose theirvotersWASHINGTON, DCThe Supreme Courtponders whetherpartisan gerrymandering has gone too far20042016US, Wisconsin presidential election resultsBy Assembly districtA ripe smellRepublicansDemocrats49.349.746.547.2State total, %Sources: Wisconsin state legislature;Wisconsin Elections Commission40UnitedStatesThe EconomistOctober7th2017THE Onionputitbest: “‘No WayTo PreventThis,’ SaysOnlyNa-tion Where ThisRegularlyHappens.” An accurate summaryofgun-control opponents’ response to America’speriodicgunmassacres, the headline wasalso familiar. The satirical websitehasrun it, with fewalterationsto an accompanyingspoof article,ﬁve times: aftersixpeople were murdered in California in 2014;afternine were murdered in South Carolina, nine in Oregon and14 in California in 2015; and afterthe killingof58 and maimingof489 people bya lone gunman in LasVegason October1st.Satire thriveswhere the usual checkson human follyfail. Inthiscase itpointsto the factthatAmerica, despite having a gun-murderrate 25 timeshigherthan thatofotherdeveloped coun-tries, hasno seriousdebate on howto reduce the killing, becauseRepublican lawmakersrefuse to countenance the onlything thateasilywould. Bymakingiteven a bitharderforkillers to getguns—asaction taken in Australia, Britain and Canada shows—America would have fewergun deaths. Yetonlya quarter ofRe-publican votersacceptthatdemonstrable truth. Mostsay Ameri-ca would have lesscrime ifonlymore Americanswere armed.The usual explanation forthisdelusion isbrilliantly eﬀectivelobbyingbygun clubs. Since the 1970sthe National Riﬂe Associa-tion, supported bygun makers, hasrecastwhatwasonce a pub-lic- safetyissue into an argumentaboutliberty: ifyou believe gunownership isa thin red line againstgovernmenttyranny, astheNRAclaims, itscarcelymatterswhetheritalso leadsto more kill-ing. Atthe same time, the lobbyistshave bullied Republican law-makersso thoroughlythatnone daresspeakagainstthem. Askedforhisposition on gun control thisweek, Paul Ryan said he’d rath-ertalkaboutcuttingtaxes. The Onioncould notimprove on that.Yetthough Republican votershave moved markedlyagainstgun control overthe course ofthe NRA’slobbying, italone cannotexplain thatshift. ManyRepublican votersare more selective intheirsupportforgunsthan the ideologues; theytend to be mo-mentarilykeeneron gun controlsaftera massacre, forexample. Italso seemsnotable thatthe same people who believe guns makeAmerica saferare also likelyto hold a numberofother irrationalviews. Around halfofRepublicansdo notbelieve in evolution oranthropogenicclimate change. Theyhave also justelected aspresidenta man who hassuggested vaccinescause autism. Do-nald Trump’sinsurgencyin itselfsuggeststhatanyexplanationofRepublican attitudesrooted in conservative ideology shouldbe treated with caution.Aforthcomingbookbythe political scientistsEricOliver andThomasWood, “Enchanted America”, oﬀersan alternative ex-planation. Itarguesthatpeople who believe gunsmake Americasafer, amongotherfallacies, displaya strain ofsuperstition thathasalwaysexisted in American politics, on the rightand the left,butwhich in recentdecadeshasconcentrated on the right, andnowthreatensto subsume it. Itsproponents, who the authors call“intuitionists”, understand the world on the basisoffeelings andgutinstinct, notdoctrine orempirical facts, even when confront-ed with them. “Much ofwhatlookslike an ideological gap in thiscountry”, the authorswrite, “isdue more to the powerofthese in-nate intuitionsthan abstractprinciplesorvalues.”Understand that, theyargue, and itbecomeseasierto compre-hend thatthe judgmentssuch votersreach in timesofeconomicand cultural change, like the present, will be governed byfear.Thisisboth an instinctive response to uncertaintyand a self-vali-datingone, asMrOliverillustratesbyquotinghisﬁve-year-oldson: “Ifthere’sno monsterin the closet, then whyam I scared?”The refusal ofmillionsofpeople to acceptsome limits on gunownership, even though thiswould make theirfamiliessafer, re-ﬂectsthe same white-knuckled logic.Howhassuch a rich, well-governed place come to this? Rich-ard Hofstadter’sclassicessay, “The Paranoid Style in America Pol-itics”, oﬀersanotherclue. Written in 1964, itlocatesthe angerandparanoia thathad characterised the Goldwaterinsurgency—in ef-fect, an extreme case ofintuitionism—in a longhistory ofpopulistresentmentand apocalypticrhetoric. ForHofstadter, the para-noid style wasa persistentbutmarginal “psychicphenomenon”,with a potential to take oﬀin certain circumstances. The mostpropitious, he mused, would be “a confrontation ofopposed in-terestswhich are (orare feltto be) totallyirreconcilable”. Itispos-sible to read America’ssubsequentpolitical history, dominatedbythe civil-rightsstruggle, the culture warsand the intractablepartisanship theyspawned, asproofofthatconjecture.FreefallingThere hassince been plentyofirrational behaviouron the left,too, includinghostilityto geneticallymodiﬁed food and the cur-renttendencyofleft-wingbloggersto see a Russian under everyrock. Yetthe factthatthe losersin America’scultural struggles—in-cludingfundamentalistChristians, rural whitesand other tradi-tional folk—were on the righthasmade itthe domain of unrea-son. The election ofMrTrump sealed that. Asan irreligioussometime pro-choice proponentofgun control, he wasan im-plausible Republican champion. Still, hissupportersbacked himbecause, in theirguts, where intuitive choicesare made, theyfelthe wason theirside, so none ofthatmattered. On gunsand much else, thissuggests, Republican leadershave been directingthe viewsoftheirsupportersmuch less thantheythought. They, and theirNRA auxiliaries, could nothaveturned Republican voterson to gun ownership so dramaticallyhad the issue notspoken to theirpre-existingfearsand fantasies.And much good hassuch panderingdone the leaders. Ithas giventhem MrTrump fora bossand a civil war, between populists andtrue conservatives, upon which theirpartycould founder. Ithasalso leftthem, in the wake ofAmerica’sworstcivilian massacrein a century, with nothingto say.7The powerofmagical thinkingSuperstition helps explain whymanyRepublicans thinkloose gun laws keep them safeLexingtonThe EconomistOctober7th2017411INTHE warren ofalleywaysthatmake upRocinha, Brazil’slargestfavela, the air isheavywith foreboding.

In Rocinha the UPPsreduced the cir-culation ofheavyweaponry, saysMishaGlenny, authorofa bookaboutthe favela.The state gave bonusesto oﬃcersin areaswhere crime dropped most. Although theUPPsdid notdismantle the gangs, violencefell. By2015 the homicide rate had droppedto itslowestlevel in 25 years.Optimism did notlast.

Since the 2003 inauguration of a KFEZ in Incheon, the number of zones in operation has grown to eight: Incheon, Busan-Jinhae, Gwangyang Bay Area, Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Saemangeum-Gunsan, Yellow Sea, East Coast and Chungbuk.The amount of foreign direct investment in the KFEZs during 2016 increased by 53% to $2.3 billion, compared to $1.48 billion in the previous year. This accounted for 10% of the total foreign direct investment in Ko-rea. By the end of 2016, 126,000 people were employed in these zones.Development of two-thirds of the 320km2 initially allocated to the KFEZs is now com-plete or in progress. Investment conditions are continuing to improve as regulations are relaxed and more effective policies in-troduced; foreign investors operating in the zones receive a range of beneﬁ ts, including tax exemptions.As a trade hub in north-east Asia, Korea is internationally recognised for the excellence of its infrastructure, along with its strategic geographical position, highly skilled workforce and integration into global logistics systems. Having a base in one of the KFEZs increases the advantages of do-ing business in Korea by opening access to a deregulated environment and ﬁ nancial support. The perks include reductions in or exemptions from corporate tax, income tax, acquisition tax and property tax. Foreign investors can directly exchange currency of up to $20,000 to clear business transac-tions, and there are also cash grants and more liberal labour regulations.Each KFEZ designates individual project managers who support investors through all necessary procedures, providing consult-ing on new investment opportunities and prospective investment partners, as well as administrative support in the areas of legal affairs, accounting and tax management. This service eases and speeds the invest-ment process, making it even clearer that in-vesting in one of the Korean Free Economic Zones is an exceptionally smart decision.For more information, visit www.fez.go.kr“Although we are a multinational company, we manufacture here in Korea to offer our products at a reasonable price for our customers.

Out of the traps

After a rocky few years, emerging markets have become more
mature and resilient, says Simon Cox. But along with the drama,
some of their dynamism has gone

IN 1875 THE Ottoman Empire defaulted on half its foreign debt, a victim
of the “ﬁrst major debt crisis of the developing world”, according to one
account of the mess. Its creditors, led by the Imperial Ottoman Bank,
forced the empire’s grand vizier to accept a humiliating solution. Rather
than wait to be repaid out of tax revenues, they won the right to collect
half a dozen taxes themselves, including stamp duty and duties on alco-
hol. After 15 years of tax farming, the Imperial Ottoman Bank was com-
fortable enough to build impressive new headquarters in Istanbul, neo-
orientalist in style on one side and neoclassical on the other. 
Since long before the term was invented, emerging markets have
provided a rich source of both peril and proﬁt. That ﬁnancial crisis in 1875
was followed by many others, including a hatful in Turkey. And like the
Imperial Ottoman Bank, investors with strong stomachs have often prof-
ited the most from emerging markets at their worst. Hedge funds that
bought impaired Argentine debt for roughly 20 cents on the dollar after
its default in 2001 extracted a handsome settlement from its new govern-
ment last year, worth perhaps ten times what they paid, according to
some estimates. 
The more recent history of emerging markets has also tested plenty
of stomachs. Within days of Donald Trump’s election victory his popu-
list promises raised American bond yields, sending the price of emerg-
ing-market assets the other way. Trading partners winced at his tweets
threatening American companies planning to shift their production
abroad. This “Trump tantrum” appeared to be the latest in a grim se-
quence of setbacks for emerging markets. It followed China’s botched de-
valuation of the yuan in 2015, the collapse in oil and iron-ore prices in
2014 and the “taper tantrum” in 2013, when mere talk of a slowdown in
asset purchases by America’s Federal Reserve threw emerging markets
into turmoil. The Trump tantrum came on top of political risks arising in
emerging markets themselves, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,
the Philippines’ war on drugs, a successful coup in Thailand in 2014 and a

failed one in Turkey in 2016, the removal of an unpopular presi-
dent in Brazil for a ﬁscal misdemeanour, and the survival of em-
battled rulers in South Africa and Malaysia.
Strange as it may seem, though, the presidency of Mr
Trump, an avowed opponent of globalism, has coincided with a
recovery in globalisation. In the ﬁrst half of this year the volume
of emerging-market exports was 4.6% up on a year earlier, the
fastest growth since 2011, according to the Netherlands Bureau for
Economic Policy Analysis, a government agency. The growing
demand for semiconductor chips and sensors lifted South Ko-
rea’s and Malaysia’s electronics exports; the recovery of the oil
price bolstered Russia; and a favourable turn in the weather
beneﬁted Brazil’s harvest of soyabeans and corn. 
Higher exports have helped lift GDP. In the ﬁrst half of 2017
the four biggest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India and
China, known as the BRICs) all grew simultaneously for the ﬁrst
time in three years. Emerging-market growth still cannot match
that in the miracle years of 2003-06, but it has been equally
broad. So far 21 of the 24 countries in the MSCI emerging-markets
index, the most popular stockmarket benchmark, have reported
GDP ﬁgures for the second quarter of this year, and all of them
were up on the previous quarter. Not since 2009 has growth
been positive in every member that publishes quarter-on-quar-
ter numbers. 
This improvement in emerging-market growth has been ac-
companied by renewed enthusiasm for their currencies, bonds
and shares (see chart above). In August these countries recorded
their ninth month in a row of capital inﬂows from portfolio in-
vestors, the longest streak since 2014, according to the Institute of
International Finance. An index of emerging-market exchange
rates compiled by MSCI has risen by 14% since its trough in Janu-
ary 2016. It has enjoyed its best 18 months since 2011. Even ill-fa-
voured currencies such as the Russian rouble, Mexican peso and
Chinese yuan have deﬁed their doubters, strengthening against
the dollar this year (see chart on right). 
The price of emerging markets’ “hard-currency” dollar
bonds rose by over 6% in the ﬁrst half of the year, according to J.P.
Morgan. And bonds denominated in their own, hardening cur-
rencies did even better, rising by double digits. But nothing has
been as eye-catching as their stockmarkets. The MSCI EM index
rose above 1,000 in May from below 700 in January 2016, an an-
nualised gain of about 33%.
The strength of the rally makes many old hands nervous.
The history of emerging markets is full of imprudent investors as
well as improvident borrowers. The delusion of those parting
with their money often matches the myopia of those squander-
ing it. In 1895, for example, a stockmarket boom prompted one

big international bank to nearly triple its loans in two years. The
bank’s own manager peddled South African mining shares such
as the Transvaal Consolidated Land and Exploration Company.
When the shares crashed, the bank suﬀered a run, turning to the
government and its London owners for a bail-out. This reckless
ﬁnancial institution was none other than the Imperial Ottoman
Bank that had grown rich from tax farming a few years earlier. 
Pessimists can ﬁnd a number of reasons to worry, some tra-
ditional, others more novel. Classic emerging-market crises of-
ten begin in Washington, DC, when the Fed raises interest rates
or tightens monetary policy in other ways. So nerves will jangle
if an uptick in American inﬂation pushes the Fed to increase
rates faster than the market now expects. And for a new varia-
tion on this old theme, investors can fret about the Fed’s recent
decision to begin trimming the assets it bought after the global ﬁ-
nancial crisis. 
The commodity cycle is another time-tested source of in-
stability. The halving of oil prices in the second half of 2014 in-
ﬂicted great pain on Russia and other crude exporters. Converse-
ly, costly oil in the years before 2014 added to the chronic trade
deﬁcits and inﬂation suﬀered by countries such as India and
Pakistan. The Latin American debt crisis in 1982 was caused by a
combination of a commodity shock and a Fed shock. The petro-
dollars earned by Gulf exporters during the oil-price spikes of the
1970s were deposited in American banks, which lent them incau-
tiously to Latin American governments. These loans then be-
came impossible to repay when the Fed raised interest rates
sharply in 1979-81.

The have-nots

Countries not blessed with commodities have worries of
their own. The only natural resource in many emerging markets
is manpower, but a growth model based on labour-intensive
manufacturing now faces two unaccustomed threats. One is
automation. The growing versatility and user-friendliness of ro-
botic technology may be eroding the advantages of cheap la-
bour, resulting in what economists call “premature deindustrial-
isation”. Post-industrial rustbelts are common in rich economies
like America. The fear is that emerging-market industries will
turn rusty before their people grow rich.
Another threat is protectionism. Emerging economies have
always relied on access to the world’s biggest markets for their ex-
ports. But the Trump administration is keen to reduce America’s
trade imbalances, and has become more active in imposing anti-
dumping duties and other tariﬀs on goods it considers too cheap.
It has so far opened investigations into 65 potential cases of
dumped or subsidised products (from Chinese staples to Colom-
bian citric acid), compared with 44 in the same period of 2016.

As some countries worry about exporting to America’s
market, others worry about importing its politics. In both Brazil
and Mexico, the candidates for the next presidential election in-
clude outspoken populists who draw strength from battling with
Mr Trump or mirroring his provocations. Emerging markets have
traditionally had a strong comparative advantage in populism.
But that is another imbalance Mr Trump seems keen to correct. 
This special report will examine each of these dangers in
turn. It will argue that emerging economies in recent years have
become more resilient, albeit less vigorous, losing some drama
as well as some dynamism. That should allow their recovery to
continue despite the threats they face.
A lot of emerging-market investors are “waiting for the
good old-fashioned crisis”, said Mark Dow, a money manager
and former IMF economist, in a podcast interview late last year.
In their experience, “it always ends with a blow-up…it’s hap-

pened so many times for so many of the old wizened EM hands
that they are conditioned to believe it has to be like that again.” 
It does not, but plenty of doubters remain. In particular, the
failure of emerging markets to deal eﬀectively with earlier shocks
(such as higher oil prices in the 1970s, tighter Fed policy in 1979-81
and mightier Chinese manufacturing in the 2000s) has contrib-
uted to a lingering concern that middle-income countries are
more likely to become “trapped” as they develop, marooned
somewhere between poverty and prosperity.
If the “middle-income trap” were found to be real, it would
pose a more serious problem than ever before. Countries at that
intermediate level of development account for a growing share
of the world’s GDP and its people. The global economy could not
prosper if such an enormous part of its population and produc-
tion were to become thus ensnared. Fortunately, as this report
will argue, the trap is a myth. 7

What’s in a name?

A self-fulﬁlling prophecy

WHAT COUNTS AS an emerging market?
Broadly speaking, an economy that is not too
r ich, not too poor and not too closed to
foreign capital. The term was coined by
Antoine van Agtmael in 1981 when he was
working for the International Finance Corpo-
ration (IFC), a division of the World Bank. He
hoped to create what he had named: a set of
promising stockmarkets, lif ted from obscur i-
ty, thereby attracting the investment they
needed to thr ive.
At the time, it was hard work even to
compare the per formance of stockmarkets in
places like Brazil, India and South Korea. The
IFC, having collected data on ten such mar-
kets, felt that foreign investors might take to
these boondock bourses, but would be put oﬀ
by the r isk of investing in a single company or
the trouble of diversifying across many ﬁrms
and places. The answer, the IFC concluded,
was to provide them with a one-stop, broadly
representative “Third-World Equity Fund”.
When Mr Agtmael pitched the idea to a group
of fund managers at an event hosted by
Salomon Brothers, some were sceptical,
other intr igued. One liked the idea but hated
the name. So Mr Agtmael spent the weekend
dreaming up the term “emerging markets”,
with which he hoped to evoke “progress,
uplif t and dynamism”. That label proved
wildly successful.
The ﬁrst such fund, pioneered by Capi-
tal Group in 1986, included only four coun-
tr ies. The most popular equity benchmark,
the MSCI EM index, star ted in 1988 with ten
and now spans 24. Many people complain
that the category has become an indiscr imi-
nate grab-bag, throwing together economies
at utterly diﬀerent stages of development,
such as Taiwan and Pakistan. But the group

was never all that homogeneous. The ten
markets in the or iginal MSCI index included
the Philippines but also Por tugal, a country
seven times as r ich (at market exchange
rates). Indeed, the markets are now more
tightly correlated than they were in the early
years, according to MSCI (though less so than
in the cr isis years from 2008 to 2013). 
The emerging-markets group has also
become more prosperous and more Asian.
The World Bank now classiﬁes nine of MSCI’s
24 benchmark economies as high-income.
(These economies, which include Taiwan,
South Korea, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates
and several members of the European Union,
will not feature prominently in this special
repor t.) Asia accounts for almost 70% of the
group’s combined GDP and commands a
similar weight in the equity index. From Hong
Kong “I can cover 60% of the market cap
within four hours’ ﬂight,” says Sean Taylor of
Deutsche Bank Asset Management.
Some countr ies are much more impor-

tant to investors than their economic weight
would suggest, thanks to their unusually
deep and open stock- or debt markets. The
best example is South Afr ica: the combined
value of shares on its stockmarket is more
than three times its GDP. The biggest com-
pany listed on its stockmarket is Naspers,
mainly because it has a 33% stake in Tencent,
a Chinese internet giant. 
As well as progress, uplif t and dyna-
mism, emerging markets have traditionally
featured cr ises, defaults and slumps. Many
have been laid low by proﬂigate govern-
ments, overstretched companies, mis-
matched balance-sheets, ﬁckle foreign
capital or volatile commodity pr ices. Such
setbacks can take a toll on their long-term
prospects, preventing them from graduating
to the ranks of mature markets. Poor econo-
mies typically become “emerging markets”
because they have grown quickly. They re-
main “emerging” because they have not
managed to grow steadily.

The middle-income trap

Mixed-income myths

Countr ies that are neither r ich nor poor can hold their
own against r ivals at both extremes

EVERY FEW YEARS Foreign Aﬀairs, a magazine about inter-
national relations, provokes a fracas in a neighbouring dis-
cipline, international economics. In 1994 it published an essay by
Paul Krugman, “The Myth of Asia’s Miracle”, which re-examined
the source of the tigers’ success. Then, after the Asian ﬁnancial
crisis, it came up with “The Capital Myth” by Jagdish Bhagwati,
which re-examined the case for free capital ﬂows, the source of
the tigers’ humiliation. In 2004 it oﬀered “Globalisation’s Miss-
ing Middle” by Geoﬀrey Garrett, then at the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles. This essay is cited much less often than the
other two, but in a roundabout way it has been equally inﬂuen-
tial. It argued that middle-ranked countries were in a bind, un-
able to compete either with the cutting-edge technology of rich
nations or the cut-throat prices of poor ones. “Middle-income
countries”, it said, “have not done nearly as well under global-
ised markets as either richer or poorer countries.” 
To prove his point, Mr Garrett ranked the world’s econo-
mies by GDP per person in 1980, dividing them into three groups:
top, middle and bottom. He then compared their growth by that
measure over the subsequent two decades, ﬁnding that the mid-
dle-ranked economies grew more slowly than either the top or
bottom ones. Three years later Homi Kharas and Indermit Gill of
the World Bank cited Mr Garrett’s essay in a book about East
Asia’s growth prospects. They invented the term “middle-in-
come trap”, which subsequently took on a life of its own. 
The trap can be interpreted in a variety of ways, which may
be one reason why so many people believe in it. Some confuse
the trap with the simple logic of catch-up growth. According to
that logic, poorer countries can grow faster than richer ones be-
cause imitation is easier than innovation and because capital

earns higher returns when it is scarce. By the same logic, a coun-
try’s growth will naturally slow down as the gap with the lead-
ing economies narrows and the scope for catch-up growth di-
minishes. All else equal, then, middle-income countries should
grow more slowly than poorer ones. But Mr Garrett was making
a bolder argument: that middle-income countries tend to grow
more slowly than both poorer and richer economies.
The notion of a trap resonated widely with policymakers,
note Messrs Kharas and Gill, especially in countries where
growth had lost its lustre. Najib Razak, Malaysia’s prime minister,
began talking about it in 2009. Trap-talk also spread to Vietnam’s
leaders in 2009 and appeared in South Africa’s National Devel-
opment Plan in 2012.
By far the most prominent trap-watcher is China, one of the
few middle-income economies that is more than middle-sized.
In 2015 Lou Jiwei, then China’s ﬁnance minister, said that his
country had a 50% chance of falling into the trap in the next ﬁve
to ten years. The same fear haunts Liu He, an inﬂuential eco-
nomic adviser to Xi Jinping, China’s president. Mr Liu was one of
the driving forces behind a report entitled “China 2030”, pub-
lished in 2012 by his Development Research Centre (DRC) and
the World Bank. The report featured a chart that has perhaps
done more than any other to spread the idea of a middle-income
trap (see chart). It showed that of 101 countries which counted as
middle-income in 1960, only 13 had achieved high-income status
by 2008. The rest spent the intervening 50 years trapped in medi-
ocrity or worse.

Slow and queasy

The evidence in the chart and Mr Garrett’s essay was sug-
gestive but hardly systematic. However, it was buttressed by a
more rigorous pair of studies by Barry Eichengreen of the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, Donghyun Park of the Asian De-
velopment Bank and Kwanho Shin of Korea University, which
reached similar conclusions. They looked for fast-growing econ-
omies that subsequently suﬀered sustained slowdowns (deﬁn-
ing fast growth as at least 3.5% per person, and a slowdown as a
two-percentage-point drop in growth, both averaged over seven
years). Their research indicated that these slowdowns seemed to
cluster at GDP levels of $11,000 and $15,000 per person (con-
verted into dollars at purchasing-power parity).
Perhaps the most sophisticated analysis was published by
Shekhar Aiyar and his colleagues at the IMF in 2013. They sought
to distinguish between growth traps and the natural slowdown
that any country can expect as it converges with leading econo-
mies. To do this, they ﬁrst calculated an expected growth path for
each country, based on its income per person as well as its hu-
man and physical capital. Second, they looked for countries that
were growing faster or slower than expected, resulting in posi-
tive or negative growth gaps. Third, they looked for unusually se-
vere and sustained slowdowns, when these growth gaps wid-
ened sharply. They found that middle-income countries were
more likely to suﬀer such setbacks, no matter how middle in-
come was deﬁned. 
The combined weight of this economic evidence and
policymakers’ intuition is hard to ignore, and seems to justify
scepticism about the growth prospects of China, Malaysia, Thai-
land and many other emerging economies. But neither the intu-
ition nor the number-crunching is as convincing as it looks.
Intuitively, it seems to make sense that middle-income
countries will be squeezed between higher-tech and lower-wage
rivals on either side. But those rivals rely on high technology or
low wages for a reason. Rich economies need advanced technol-
ogies and skills to oﬀset high wages. Poor countries, for their part,
need low wages to oﬀset low levels of technology and skill. The

more than 10% over the previous seven. That qualiﬁes as a sharp
slowdown by the authors’ deﬁnition. But China is not trapped; it
is still growing faster than most countries, rich or poor. 
A similar problem bedevils the paper by Mr Aiyar and his
IMF colleagues. To see why, suppose a miracle economy were to
grow much faster than an economist would expect, given its lev-
el of income, schooling and capital. Imagine its growth were
then to moderate to a more normal pace. That might count as a
severe slowdown by the authors’ deﬁnition (since the country’s
highly positive growth gap has dropped to zero), even though the
economy was still converging on high income at a normal pace. 
Or suppose a country were rapidly to increase its invest-
ment in schooling and physical capital to avoid the middle-in-
come trap. If the strategy were successful, it might result in steady
growth. But with the method used by the IMF paper, that con-
stant growth could nonetheless count as a severe slowdown be-
cause, other things being equal, their model expects improved
education and deeper capital to raise the pace of growth, not
merely shore it up. 
Neither of these papers, then, proves the existence of a mid-
dle-income trap as commonly understood. Indeed, Mr Eichen-
green has said that his line of research was intended to explore
diﬀerent questions. But what about the DRC’s and World Bank’s
“killer” China 2030 chart? 
Its criteria for middle income are idiosyncratic. They in-
clude any country with a GDP per person between 5.2% and
42.75% of America’s, measured at purchasing-power parity. The
good news is that eight countries on the chart (including Turkey,

obvious conclusion is that mid-
dle-income countries can and
do compete with both, com-
bining middling wages with
middling levels of skill, tech-
nology and productivity.
To be sure, those average
levels mask huge variations.
Most economies have a mix of
impressive leading ﬁrms and
unsophisticated stragglers. The
productivity of the top quarter
of American ﬁrms is at least
4.86 times that of the bottom
quarter, according to a study by
Eric Bartelsman, Jonathan Has-
kel and Ralf Martin published
by the Centre for Economic
Policy Research. In developing
countries the gaps are even big-
ger. Indeed, middle-income countries are often more accurately
described as mixed-income economies.
Shaping the mix are at least four possible sources of growth
in GDP per person. The ﬁrst is moving workers from over-
manned ﬁelds to more productive factories (structural transfor-
mation). The second is adding more capital such as machinery
per worker (capital-deepening). The third is augmenting capital
or labour by making it more sophisticated, perhaps by adopting
techniques that a ﬁrm, industry or country has not previously
embraced (technological diﬀusion). The ﬁnal source of growth
derives from advances in technology that introduce something
new to the world at large (technological innovation).
Economists ﬁnd it helpful to keep these sources of growth
separate in their minds. The mistake is to think they remain sep-
arate between countries. In reality, in most countries several of
these forces are at work simultaneously, at diﬀerent paces and in
varying proportions. Countries do not wait until the last surplus
farm worker has left the ﬁelds to begin capital-deepening. Nor do
they wait until the returns to brute capital accumulation have
been exhausted before they start to increase the sophistication
of their production techniques. So development does not pro-
ceed in discrete stages that require a nationwide leap from one
stage to the next. It is more like a long-distance race, with a lead-
ing pack and many stragglers, in which the result is an average of
everyone’s ﬁnishing times. The more stragglers in the race, the
more room for improvement.

Positive splits

The statistical work by Messrs Eichengreen, Park and Shin
shows that middle-income countries do suﬀer slowdowns. But
since it looks only at countries with an income per person of over
$10,000, it cannot say whether they are more vulnerable to such
setbacks than poor countries. That was not a question the au-
thors ever intended to answer. When their method is extended
to countries further down the income scale, it turns out that slow-
downs among poorer economies are at least as prevalent as
among middle-income ones. 
Countries in the middle do slow more often than rich coun-
tries, but that is partly because rich economies rarely grow fast
enough (3.5% per person over seven years) to be eligible for a
slowdown as the paper deﬁnes it. Nor is such a slowdown suﬃ-
cient to trap an economy. Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan have all endured at least one, and none of them is
trapped in middle income. Growth in China’s GDP per person
has also slowed, to about 7.6% over the past seven years, against

Malaysia, Oman and Poland) have since escaped the middle-in-
come bracket thanks to better data or further growth. Ten others,
the Slovak Republic among them, have also crossed that thresh-
old but were not included on the chart because either the data or
the countries themselves did not exist in 1960.
But the chart contains a more fundamental ﬂaw. Its criteria
for middle-income are too broad to be useful. By its deﬁnition, a
country with a GDP of just $590 per person (at 1990 prices) count-
ed as middle income in 1960. That includes countries like China
in the middle of its Great Famine. At the other extreme, a country
with a GDP per person of $13,300 in 2008 also counted as middle
income. This upper threshold for 2008 is more than 2,000% high-
er than the lower one for 1960. No wonder so many countries re-
mained stuck in between them. 
One of them was China. Its GDP per person increased ten-
fold between 1960 and 2008, despite the famine and the Cultural
Revolution. But because it started that period above $590 and
ended it below $13,300, it remained conﬁned to the middle
square of the China 2030 grid.
One of the World Bank staﬀ involved in the China 2030 re-
port has subsequently co-written a paper investigating the mid-
dle-income trap more closely. It found no “evidence for [unusual]
stagnation at any particular middle-income level”. More recent-
ly, research by Xuehui Han of the Asian Development Bank and
Shang-Jin Wei of Columbia, and separately by Lant Pritchett and
Larry Summers of Harvard, has also cast doubt on the trap. An-
other Harvard economist, Robert Barro, the doyen of empirical
growth studies, thinks that “this idea is a myth.” The transition
from middle to upper income is certainly “challenging”, he
writes. But it is no more challenging than the transition from low
to middle. 
Messrs Kharas and Gill are themselves agnostic about the
precise deﬁnition and empirical salience of the term they invent-
ed. They introduced it “with modesty, because we had not rigor-
ously established its prevalence”, they wrote ten years later.
Since some middle-income countries have undeniably stagnat-
ed, barriers to their growth clearly exist. As Messrs Kharas and
Gill see it, what matters is whether these threats take a distinctive
“middle-income” form, not whether they are more common or
severe than the dangers facing other economies.

Trappist agnosticism

The duo came up with the term chieﬂy because the eco-
nomics profession seemed to oﬀer no clear or convincing growth
recipe for middle-income countries. Partly as a result, policy-
makers often felt caught between two stools: either they clung on
to old growth strategies (such as low-end manufacturing) for too
long, or they embraced sophisticated models (such as the
“knowledge economy”) too soon. The middle-income trap is
really a middle-income dilemma.
What about Mr Garrett’s original ﬁnding in Foreign Aﬀairs,
which helped inform the thinking of Messrs Kharas and Gill? An
eﬀort to replicate that exercise, with newer data covering the
same 20 years, shows a much narrower gap between middle-
and high-income growth for the period from 1980 to 2000. And
that gap all but disappears if the countries are divided into three
groups of equal size, rather than Mr Garrett’s somewhat arbi-
trary 25-45-30% split. 
More importantly, middle-income countries, even by his
deﬁnition, grew faster than their high-income counterparts over
the two decades from 1990 to 2010, as well as from 1995 to 2015. It
seems that in the 1990s and 2000s middle-income countries
were quite capable of competing with cutting-edge economies.
So what tripped them up in the 1980s? Part of the answer may lie
with America’s Federal Reserve. 7

Macroeconomic resilience

Freedom from ﬁnancial
fear

Emerging markets have acquired more room for
manoeuvre

IN WALKING A middle path, between self-indulgence and
self-mortiﬁcation, Buddhists face great temptations. This
struggle for self-control animates many of their paintings, includ-
ing “Star’s Seed” by the Thai artist Thawan Duchanee. The paint-
ing depicts a muscular man with the mandibles of a rhinoceros
beetle—beastly appendages that symbolise man’s base cravings.
Only by shedding these cravings, Buddhists believe, can man be
free from fear.
The painting hangs on a wall in the Bank of Thailand,
which faces its own temptations and fears. Like any central bank,
it must resist the lure of inﬂation. And like many of its peers in
emerging markets, it lives with a fear of global ﬁnancial forces be-
yond its control. When America’s Federal Reserve raises interest
rates, when global investors lose their appetite for risk, or when
multinational banks shrink their lending, emerging markets
worry about the impact on their own currencies, balance-sheets
and economies.
The temptations and the fears are connected. Emerging
markets have traditionally struggled to keep inﬂation under con-
trol. For that reason, they have often tethered their exchange
rates to the dollar and borrowed in hard currencies at the insis-
tence of foreign creditors. This institutional anchoring helped
them attract inﬂows of foreign capital, which often ﬁnanced
large current-account deﬁcits. But their anchors also acted as
shackles. They forced the central banks slavishly to follow the
Fed’s monetary policy so as to preserve their currency’s standing
against the dollar. And they left their economies vulnerable to
any interruption in foreign lending and investment. 
Whenever foreign capital inﬂows dried up, emerging mar-
kets wrestled with a painful dilemma. To appease foreign inves-
tors and defend their currencies, they could raise interest rates to
punishingly high levels; but that would bankrupt many domes-
tic companies. Or they could ease monetary policy and let their
currencies drop; but that would also bankrupt any companies
with dollar debts. Either way promised ruin.
Ruin duly arrived in a succession of ﬁnancial crises. When
the Fed raised interest rates to 20% to ﬁght inﬂation in 1979-81, Lat-

in American governments could no longer aﬀord to service the
vast dollar loans extended to them by American banks. The debt
crisis that followed condemned the region to a “lost decade”
which may have helped inspire the notion of a middle-income
trap. Something similar happened in Mexico in 1994, when the
Fed again raised rates faster than expected. And a broader wave
of crises struck emerging markets from July 1997, when the Thai
baht broke its peg to the dollar, to January 2002, when Argentina
formally abandoned the peso’s parity with the greenback. These
blows rid them of both their shackles and their anchor. Without
the external discipline provided by the dollar, they had to build
their own institutional defences against inﬂation. 

Control yourself

Happily, in the subsequent struggle for macroeconomic
self-control, emerging markets have proved themselves more
man than beetle. Inﬂation, averaged across the world’s emerging
and developing countries, fell from 13% in 1999 to less than 4.4%
last year, according to the IMF. In the members of the MSCI
emerging-markets index it is even lower. The latest average,
weighted by each country’s size in the index, is only 2.6%, says
Bhanu Baweja of UBS, a bank (see chart). 
This self-control has brought a number of beneﬁts. First, it
has allowed emerging-market governments to sell bonds de-
nominated in their own currencies, which has given them more
ﬁscal room for manoeuvre. For most of the past half-century,
their tax and spending policies have been stuck in a “procyclical-
ity trap”, according to Carlos Végh, Daniel Lederman and Feder-
ico Bennett of the World Bank. Governments have raised discre-
tionary spending during booms, to placate clamorous constitu-
ents, then cut it during busts, to appease jittery creditors. 
But in more recent years the pattern has shifted. Of the big
emerging economies, Chile, South Korea, Turkey, India, China,
Mexico, South Africa and Malaysia have all been able to pursue
countercyclical policies, on average, since the turn of the cen-
tury; and since the global ﬁnancial crisis that began in 2007, Peru
and Colombia have joined their ranks. “The region appears to
have begun to ﬁnally break the shackles of the procyclicality
trap,” note Mr Végh and his team.
In addition to this ﬁscal ﬂexibility, the increased macroeco-
nomic credibility of emerging markets has won them an unac-
customed degree of monetary freedom. When the Fed tightens
monetary policy, they no longer have to follow in lockstep. They
can keep interest rates steady, letting their currency fall against
the dollar, without worrying as much about the increased threat
of inﬂation or the heavier weight of dollar debt. Indeed, since the
Fed began to raise interest rates in December 2015, many emerg-
ing-market central banks have shifted their own rates down, not
up. In 17 out of the 24 members of the MSCI emerging-markets in-
dex, the central bank’s policy rate is now the same or lower than
it was before the Fed’s ﬁrst hike. 
But some sources of vulnerability remain. The central
bank’s policy rate is not the only determinant of a country’s ﬁ-
nancial conditions. Some economists, such as Hélène Rey of the
London Business School, have argued that broader ﬁnancial con-
ditions, including longer-term interest rates, credit growth and
capital ﬂows, are driven by a forceful and synchronised global ﬁ-
nancial cycle that is beyond the control of local central banks.
Even when they are not constrained by a peg to the dollar, emerg-
ing markets cannot free themselves from these global forces, Ms
Rey argues. Policymakers must either submit to them or repel
them by erecting capital controls. 
The “taper tantrum” of 2013 lent support to this fear. Gov-
ernments and especially companies in emerging markets had
taken advantage of worldwide monetary easing to issue large

The Economist October 7th 2017 

amounts of cheap debt. These lax ﬁnancial conditions were,
however, rudely interrupted in May 2013, when Ben Bernanke,
then the Fed’s chairman, mused on an eventual slowdown in the
bank’s asset purchases. That was enough to unsettle big emerg-
ing markets like Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey,
despite their ﬂexible currencies. They became known as the
“fragile ﬁve”.
The tantrum demonstrated that ﬂoating currencies could
not insulate emerging economies entirely from global ﬁnancial
forces, as Ms Rey has argued. But recent research by Maurice
Obstfeld, Jonathan Ostry and Mahvash Qureshi of the IMF con-
ﬁrms that ﬂexible exchange rates still oﬀer more autonomy than
dollar pegs. And that autonomy is greater still in countries with
narrower trade deﬁcits, lower inﬂation and lower levels of debt. 
The fragile ﬁve seem less delicate today than they did in
2013. In the intervening years, all of them have narrowed or elim-
inated their current-account deﬁcits; all except India have bene-
ﬁted from an improvement in the competitiveness of their cur-
rencies; and all except Turkey have reduced inﬂation and credit
growth. In both India and Brazil, the combined debt of house-
holds and non-ﬁnancial corporations has declined as a propor-
tion of GDP since the taper tantrum. In South Africa it began fall-
ing in 2016, and in Indonesia it has increased only slowly. 
The credit growth causing most concern among emerging
economies is not in the formerly fragile ﬁve but in China. Its stock
of outstanding credit as a proportion of its GDP is a massive 213%.
This ﬁgure, known as “total social ﬁnancing” (TSF), is supposed
to capture all sources of ﬁnance for households and enterprises.
Economists often subtract some items from this total (such as
equity ﬁnancing) and add others (such as the local-government
bonds that have replaced some bank loans to infrastructure ven-
tures). But these adjustments do not greatly change the underly-
ing story.
What is scary about the number is how quickly it has risen.
Five years ago it was below 169%. The IMF has identiﬁed 43 previ-
ous cases in which a country’s ratio of credit to GDP has risen by
more than 30 percentage points in ﬁve years. In 38 of them the
boom ended in a ﬁnancial crisis or “major” slowdown. And in
two of the remaining ﬁve the crisis arrived a few years later.
Many economists worry that a similar fate awaits China.
Some bearish investors are counting on it. They have bet heavily
against the yuan in the belief that a ﬁnancial bust in China will
oblige its authorities to ease monetary policy and cheapen its

currency. Such exchange-rate ﬂuctuations are now common-
place in other emerging economies. But China is still an outlier. It
allows the yuan to move each day by just 2% either side of a
benchmark dollar rate it sets each morning. In August 2015 it tried
both to devalue the currency modestly and to introduce more
two-way ﬂexibility in its movements, but succeeded only in cre-
ating self-fulﬁlling expectations of further depreciation. 
For a few months China seemed caught in the same trap
that ensnared other Asian emerging markets in the late 1990s. It
appeared to face an invidious choice between vigorously tight-
ening monetary policy to defend the yuan, or letting the curren-
cy fall. But China had four defences that other economies lacked.
Its dollar debts were modest relative to the size of its economy; it
still had a large current-account surplus, which brought in a
steady stream of dollar earnings; it was sitting on a bigger stock-
pile of foreign-exchange reserves; and it had retained closer con-
trols on capital outﬂows. 
Between August 2015 and January of this year it lost over
$500bn of reserves as it tried to cushion the yuan’s decline. It
cracked down on what it deemed to be wasteful overseas acqui-
sitions by Chinese ﬁrms. And it subjected requests for dollars by
companies and individuals to heightened regulatory scrutiny, in-
cluding a daunting increase in paperwork. Eventually it was able
to quash the downward pressure on the currency. Over the ﬁrst
eight months of this year the yuan strengthened by over 5%
against a dollar that had lost much of its upward momentum. In
August, the dollar value of China’s foreign-exchange reserves in-
creased for the seventh month in a row. 
Whatever its impact on the yuan, will China’s credit boom
nonetheless result in a sharp slowdown in growth? To answer
this question, it helps to scrutinise why its credit-to-GDP ratio
rose so quickly in the ﬁrst place. During the crisis year of 2009,
the ratio jumped because credit grew dramatically, thanks to Chi-
na’s stimulus eﬀorts; but since then credit growth has been slow-
ing steadily (see chart). The ratio has nonetheless continued to
rise because nominal GDP has expanded unusually slowly. 
Many economists point out that the credit-intensity of Chi-
na’s economy deteriorated between 2011 and 2016. It took more
credit to generate a yuan of growth. The reason may be that
much of this credit was spent not on newly produced assets such
as buildings or machinery, but on existing assets such as land and
previously constructed buildings. This kind of spending adds
nothing to GDP, which measures only new production, not
transfers of ownership of existing wealth. 
If that credit mix could be
reversed, it would help China
to reduce leverage without re-
ducing growth. The relation-
ship between new credit and
new production would im-
prove. Fortunately, that
im-
provement has already got un-
der way: credit growth has
slowed in recent quarters even
as nominal GDP growth has
picked up. In response, China’s
credit-to-GDP ratio in the sec-
ond quarter fell by a fraction of
a percentage point. If it contin-
ues to stabilise, it will lift a big
macroeconomic
cloud still
hanging over emerging mar-
kets—especially those that pro-
vide the raw materials for Chi-
na’s growth. 7

Many families in this suburb of Soweto, a formerly black town-
ship in greater Johannesburg, are still crammed into makeshift
housing. When it is hot outside, the temperature inside is “times
two”, says one resident, who shares six rooms with 20 others.
And when it turns cold, the chill inside is also “times two”.
On the other side of the railway tracks the government is in-
vesting heavily in Walter Sisulu Square, where in 1955 the African
National Congress (ANC) and its allies adopted the Freedom
Charter, a statement of principles for a post-apartheid nation.
The charter’s commitments, written in stone on a monument in
the square, include demolishing slums and building well-lit sub-
urbs. They also include transferring ownership of the mineral
wealth beneath the soil to the people. The contrast between
what the charter says and what the slum itself reveals tells you
how broken the system is, says one squatter.
The resources beneath South Africa’s soil, including iron
ore, precious metals and coal, ought to be an unmitigated bless-
ing. Johannesburg, the city of gold, owes its existence to these
riches. Its landscape is still dotted with piles of sandy residue, or
“tailings”, from mining and quarrying. The industry accounts for
over 20% of South Africa’s exports and employs over 450,000
people. But it also adds to the volatility of South Africa’s econ-
omy and the pugnacity of its politics. 
Mining and quarrying shrank by 4.7% in 2016, then re-
bounded, growing by 4.3% year-on-year in the ﬁrst half of 2017.
This improvement partly reﬂects stronger growth in China,
which consumes almost half of the world’s coal, 30% of its gold

ly escape the ups and downs of global commodity cycles, they
can do a lot to moderate them. By containing the upturns, they
can cushion the downturns. The key to this lies not in the mining
industry itself, but in a country’s central bank and ﬁnance minis-
try. Resource-rich economies need equally resourceful macro-
economic policies. 
One of the best examples is Chile. Its ﬁscal rule curbs gov-
ernment spending when the copper price exceeds its long-term
trend, as judged by an independent committee of experts. Dur-
ing good times, ﬁscal restraint makes room for mining to boom
without unduly squeezing the rest of the economy. During bad
times, it leaves scope for ﬁscal easing to oﬀset the damage.
Chile’s ﬁscal benchmarks were better calibrated than the
rule Russia introduced in 2008 (and overhauled in 2013). Rather
than allow an independent committee to estimate the long-term
oil price, Russia used a backward-looking average. According to
the IMF, that resulted in a benchmark oil price of $85 a barrel in
2016 when prices had already fallen to $42. 
Russia was forced to abandon its ﬁscal rule in 2015. By then
the country’s central bank had also given up trying to defend the
rouble, allowing it to fall in line with the price of crude. At the
time Russia’s devaluation was humiliating. But a cheaper ex-
change rate can be a godsend for an oil exporter when the price
of crude drops. Russia’s diminished currency kept the rouble val-
ue of oil revenues steady. And by boosting Russia’s competitive-
ness, it helped to oﬀset the damage that lower oil prices inﬂicted
on the country’s trade balance. Unemployment is now lower
than it was in 2013, when oil prices were around $100 a barrel.
Having survived the M-shaped commodity cycle, resource-
rich emerging markets can hope for an easier script in the years
ahead. China’s growth has stopped slowing and OPEC produc-
tion has stopped rising. The cartel decided in November 2016 to
cut production by over 3% to 32.5m barrels per day (a decision
matched by restraint from 11 other oil producers, including Rus-
sia). America, meanwhile, has become an “unwitting swing pro-
ducer” of oil, in the words of the Economist Intelligence Unit, a
sister company of The Economist. When crude prices drop below
$45 a barrel, shale producers withdraw, pushing the price back
up. When prices rise above $56, America’s nimble operators in-

Economists have questioned whether the “resource
curse” is real. Rather than resource dependence leading
to slow growth, it could be the other way around

vest in new rigs, pushing the price back down. So another bout of
commodity-price volatility should not scupper the emerging-
market recovery. 
The economic instability and political division sometimes
associated with natural resources have caused some economists
to think of them as a curse, not a blessing. In a seminal paper pub-
lished in 1995, Jeﬀrey Sachs and Andrew Warner, two economists
then both at Harvard, found that economies dependent on re-
source exports grew more slowly than others not so blessed.
But economic thinking on this issue is also prone to divi-
sion and swings in sentiment. Several researchers have ques-
tioned whether the resource curse is real or just a statistical illu-
sion. The seminal Sachs-Warner study, they say, may be marred
by reverse causality: rather than resource dependence leading to
slow growth, it could be the other way around. This is because
the two authors calculate resource exports as a proportion of
GDP, so anything that lowers GDP will mechanically increase re-
source dependence by their measure, creating the illusion of a

jewellery and over 40% of its steel. But the industry’s economic
prospects remain hostage to its political fortunes. 
Like any industry, mining must oﬀer suﬃciently rewarding
pay and proﬁts to attract the capital and labour it requires. Unlike
other industries, however, mining tends to generate excess re-
turns or “rents” on top of that. Bosses, workers and politicians
are then tempted to squabble over the division of those rents,
sometimes to the detriment of the sector as a whole. This kind of
economic volatility and political bitterness are two of the more
troublesome “tailings” from resource wealth, not only in South
Africa but in many emerging markets. In 11 of the 24 countries in
MSCI’s benchmark equity index, resource rents exceeded 5% of
GDP between 2011 and 2015. That qualiﬁed them as “resource-
rich”, according to the World Bank. The rents of all 24 members
taken together also amounted to about 5%
of their combined GDP. 
Many of these resource-rich econo-
mies have gone through a twin-peaked or
“M-shaped” cycle since the mid-2000s.
Their commodities sector (as a proportion
of GDP) peaked on the eve of the ﬁnancial
crisis in 2007, plunged, then rebounded
between 2008 and 2011 and faltered again after 2014. The ﬁrst
drop reﬂected a collapse in demand following the global ﬁnan-
cial crisis. The second one was more complicated. A slowdown
in Chinese commodity purchases played a part, especially in the
case of coal and construction-related resources such as iron ore.
But in the case of oil, a rise in supply (and projected supply) was
more important. The boom in tight oil and shale production in
America prompted OPEC, the oil exporters’ cartel, to pump more
crude to defend its market share. Cheap energy, in turn, cut the
cost of agricultural production and dampened demand for bio-
fuels, leading to lower prices for grains and soyabeans. 
It is not easy to cope with a commodity cycle of this magni-
tude, driven by a boom in demand in the world’s second-biggest
economy, then a supply boom in the biggest. In the face of these
global forces, emerging economies can resemble the squatter’s
house in Kliptown: their economies run twice as hot when com-
modity markets warm up, and twice as cold when the tempera-
ture drops. But although resource-rich economies cannot entire-

causal link from resources to growth.
Economists may have missed the blessings of natural re-
sources because they were looking in the wrong place. Oil, gold,
copper and other endowments may add to the level of GDP but
not its growth rate. Imagine, for example, a $100bn economy
growing at 1% a year. Suppose it suddenly discovers a big plati-
num deposit, which yields a steady additional income of
$100bn, year in, year out. That would double the country’s GDP
to about $200bn, much to the beneﬁt of its people. But it would
also halve the country’s growth rate, because now half of this
$200bn economy is growing at 1% and the other half not at all.
Graham Davis of the Colorado School of Mines calls this
phenomenon “resource drag”. In South Africa the mining and
quarrying industry has been growing more slowly than the
economy as a whole since 1980, dragging down South Africa’s
overall GDP growth by about 0.4 percentage points. But having
both the resources and the drag is still better than having neither.
Patricio Meller of CIEPLAN, a Chilean think-tank, reckons
that economists have been biased against natural resources ever
since Adam Smith, who witnessed impressive advances in pin-
making but comparative stasis in agriculture. Even in Smith’s day
that was a mistake, says Mr Meller. After all, Britain’s industrial
revolution owed a lot to coal-mining.
Mr Meller sees the natural resources in his country as a plat-
form for technological innovation. Many of the lorries that serve
Chile’s mining industry, for example, are remotely controlled by
people sitting in an oﬃce in Santiago, over 1,000km away. In-
deed, the combination of technologies—big data, end-to-end sen-
sors, analytics—now being applied to advanced manufacturing
could also be applied to mining and agriculture. 
The application of new technologies to commodities may
alleviate whatever curses natural resources can bring. But their
application to manufacturing industry is raising a diﬀerent fear
in labour-rich emerging markets. As industrial machines be-
come more sophisticated, will they increasingly replace industri-
al workers? And if fewer jobs are on oﬀer in metal-bashing and
clothes-making, who will employ them? 7

Premature deindustr ialisation

Sew what now? 

Automation is less of a threat to workers in the
emerging world than it is made out to be

BANGLADESH EXPORTS 60% more ready-made garments
than India, a country with over eight times its population.
On the busy roads of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital, white vans
nose through the traﬃc on “Emergency Export Duty”, according
to the ambulance-like letters painted on their sides. The success
of this quintessentially labour-intensive industry helped make
Bangladesh a lower-middle-income country in 2014, according
to the World Bank’s classiﬁcations.
But some think that Bangladesh’s garment industry now
faces a new problem almost as grave as the traﬃc: the threat of
automation. Robots are already common in other kinds of
manufacturing, but still rare in clothes-making. Of the 1.63m in-
dustrial robots in operation worldwide in 2015 (the latest year for
which ﬁgures are available), only 1,580 were in textiles, apparel
and leather, says the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). 
Robots ﬁnd garment-making so hard because its basic ma-

terials are so soft. When fabric is picked up or put down, it loses
its form, creasing, crumpling, folding and draping in unpredict-
able formations. That can make it hard for a robot to keep track of
what it is handling and where to apply itself. It might be “easier to
automate the activities of a fashion designer than to automate
the people who sew clothing”, suggests Michael Chui of the
McKinsey Global Institute. 
Jian Dai, a robotics professor at King’s College London,
once described the formidable feats of robotic dexterity required
even to iron a garment, something any teenager is quite able (if
not always willing) to do. It requires miniaturised infra-red sen-
sors to ﬁnd the edge of the fabric, which must then be squeezed
between robotic ﬁngertips in an “impactive grip”. The robot also
has to maintain the tension and smoothness of the material and
align its seams. To manage all this, Mr Dai writes, the robot needs
several moving parts linked in a “multiple kinetic chain”. 
One ﬁrm that is tackling similar challenges is SoftWear
Automation, based in Atlanta, Georgia, 8,000 miles from Dhaka.
Its Sewbot uses high-speed cameras to keep track of the fabric,
vacuum nozzles to pick up and rotate pieces, and rotating balls
embedded in a worktop to move the fabric along. “Our technol-
ogies enable the micro-manipulation and macro-manipulation
of the fabric to mimic what a seamstress could do,” says Palani-
swamy Rajan, the company’s CEO. His machines can already
make simple items like pillows and bath mats on a commercial
scale. Next year the company hopes to oﬀer a T-shirt production
line. It says that a single Sewbot operator will be able to produce
1,142 T-shirts in an eight-hour shift, 17 times the number a tradi-
tional garment worker could make in that time. 
These intriguing advances in Atlanta reﬂect broader pro-
gress in robotic technology. The machines are becoming cheaper,
safer, more versatile and easier to instruct, notes Mr Chui. Unlike
many existing industrial robots, which are kept in cages, the lat-
est generation are safe enough to be used in crowded work-
spaces. They can also be easily “programmed”, a word Mr Chui
puts in quotation marks, since no coding is required. 
These pieces of kit are no longer the preserve of high-in-
come countries like Japan or Germany. Of all the industrial ro-
bots shipped in 2015, a third ended up in middle-income coun-
tries, where they were mostly used in carmaking and electronics,

according to IFR. China was the world’s biggest single buyer. 
The rising eﬃciency of robots has made economists ques-
tion some of their traditional prescriptions for success in devel-
opment. Work by Simon Kuznets in the 1960s and 1970s suggest-
ed that modern economic growth requires moving resources out
of agriculture into industry, then out of industry into services.
This arc of industrialisation is supposed to carry poor countries
into prosperity before eventually turning down as sophisticated
services take over. 
But what if robots, not people, ﬁll the factories? The McKin-
sey Global Institute calculates that it would be technically possi-
ble (if not necessarily economically sensible) to automate 67% of
India’s manufacturing employment. It came up with similar ﬁg-
ures for Indonesia and Thailand. If poor countries cannot move
enough workers into industry, the beneﬁts of productivity gains
in manufacturing cannot spread widely through their econo-
mies. Their opportunities for development will be squeezed by
automation’s impactive grip. 
Indeed, the arc of industrialisation has already changed, ac-
cording to Dani Rodrik of Harvard University. In today’s emerg-
ing economies, industry’s share of employment is peaking at a
lower level than it used to do, and at an earlier point in their de-
velopment. This trend towards premature deindustrialisation is
“not good news for developing nations”, he notes. 
But Mr Rodrik’s results are not as depressing as they seem.
Asia, as he points out, has so far deﬁed premature deindustrial-
isation. The same, in aggregate, is true of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is
chieﬂy in Latin America that the arc of industrialisation has lost
height and reach. This Latin deindustrialisation may reﬂect the
gradual abandonment of “import substitution” after the 1960s,
when governments lowered the tariﬀs protecting local alterna-
tives to foreign industrial goods. It may also reﬂect the arrival of
China as a manufacturing superpower in recent decades. But it
probably has little to do with robots, which are no more preva-
lent in Latin America than elsewhere. 
Some researchers have questioned whether the develop-
ing world as a whole has deindustrialised. They argue that
manufacturing employment became geographically more con-
centrated after 1990, but no less important. Nobuya Haraguchi of
the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UN-
IDO), Charles Fang Chin Cheng of the University of New South
Wales and Eveline Smeets, a consultant, have painstakingly
pieced together employment data on over 100 developing coun-
tries, going back to 1970. They ﬁnd that the average of each coun-
try’s manufacturing-employment ratio has indeed declined
since the early 1990s, as Mr Rodrik showed. But when they look
at developing countries in aggregate, the share of manufacturing
employment is higher than in earlier decades (see chart).
These results are not as contradictory as they seem. To see
why, imagine that the world contained only two countries: Co-
lombia and China. In Colombia, industry accounted for about
30% of employment in 1990, according to the International La-
bour Organisation. That fell to around 20% in 2015. For China, the
opposite was true. On average, then, industry’s share remained
roughly the same in both years: around 25%. But in aggregate, in-
dustry’s share increased enormously, because a tenth of China’s
workforce is a much bigger number than a tenth of Colombia’s. 
China’s takeover of manufacturing employment may itself
have peaked. The number of Chinese working in industry start-
ed falling in 2013, and China’s share of world clothing exports has
also stagnated since then. This represents a “historic opportuni-
ty” for countries like India, notes Arvind Subramanian, chief
economic adviser to India’s government. Countries such as Ban-
gladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam are seizing it, but India itself is
lagging. Its handicaps are largely self-imposed. The country’s gar-

ment-makers pay high duties to import the man-made ﬁbres that
now dominate the industry. Exporters can get a refund, but the
procedure is cumbersome. Perhaps it could be automated.
As things stand, regulatory barriers are far more damaging
for South Asia’s garment-makers than automation. Indeed, the
practical people who orchestrate supply chains for clothing re-
tailers are somewhat sceptical about the role of robots in the in-
dustry. “There are many people who have done semi-automa-
tion. But fully automated garment factories, we have not seen
any…we’re probably years away,” says Spencer Fung, chief exec-
utive of Li & Fung in Hong Kong. The company’s chairman, Wil-
liam Fung, agrees. E-commerce may have transformed retailing,
but “the supply chain that supplies this highly digitised consum-
er market is actually analogue.” 
Automation can speed things up, but it also adds to costs.
The operator of one of SoftWear’s Sewbot lines may be 17 times
as productive as a traditional garment-worker, but the typical
cost of labour in the United States, even on the minimum wage,
is more than 18 times as much as in Bangladesh. And that does
not count the cost of the bot.

Bots for basics

SoftWear Automation itself is surprisingly measured in its
claims for its technology. “There’s the perception that robots will
take over and automate everything,” says Mr Rajan, the ﬁrm’s
boss; but he believes the sewbots will remain in the minority
even 20-30 years into the future. “I expect we’ll probably auto-
mate about 20-25% of the apparel industry,” he predicts. Robots
will take care of “the high-volume basics”. But “the higher fash-
ion, lower batch sizes are always going to be done by people.” 
SoftWear Automation occasionally receives calls from Ban-
gladeshi garment-makers, but the company serves only the
American market. “If you are looking to deploy our technology
because you think you can save labour costs, then it’s the wrong
reason to do it,” says Mr Rajan. Instead, his company aims to min-
imise transport costs, reduce environmental strains and relieve
acute American labour shortages. One of their principal custom-
ers supplies America’s armed forces, whose uniforms are re-
quired by law to be made within the country. This anachronistic
legislation is supposed to preserve America’s industrial capacity
to make the things its army needs, but “the average age of seam-
stresses in America is 56,” Mr Rajan points out. 
For the foreseeable future, then, the Sewbot is not a threat to
the abundant labour in countries like Bangladesh. Its existence
owes a lot to some cutting-edge innovation and more than a little
to some long-standing American protectionism. Unfortunately,
more examples of such protectionism are on the way. 7

Protectionism

Anti-trumping duties

Does the Amer ican president’s protectionism pose a
threat to emerging countr ies?

EVEN BEFORE THEY claim their baggage at the airport, visi-
tors to the city of San Luis Potosí in central Mexico see an ad-
vertisement for the site where Ford Motors was planning to build
a $1.6bn factory. The Planta Ford is still marked on a map in the ar-
rivals hall, albeit only on a Post-it note. Follow the map, and you
will see the factory’s white steel skeleton standing out against
the brown hills of the Gogorrón National Park.
Ford’s facility, intended to build its small Focus cars, would
have created 2,800 jobs directly, and many more indirectly. But in
January the company announced it was pulling out and invest-
ing $700m in Flat Rock, Michigan, instead. President Donald
Trump, who had threatened to impose border taxes on carmak-
ers that shifted production to foreign locations, was delighted.
“Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and cre-
ating 700 new jobs in the US. This is just the beginning,” he
tweeted to his many followers. Everybody in San Luis Potosí, by
contrast, was “a little bit upset”, notes one resident.
Eight months into his presidency, Mr Trump’s trade stance
does not look quite as upsetting to emerging markets as many
had feared. Despite his campaign threats, he has not imposed
35% tariﬀs on companies relocating to Mexico or 45% tariﬀs on
goods from China. Nor has he yet withdrawn from the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

So far the world has not embarked on a trade war, at least
judging by the ballistic evidence. The members of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) between them imposed about 11 new
trade restrictions per month in the seven months to mid-May
2017, the lowest rate since 2008. They also initiated 25 trade “rem-
edies”, such as anti-dumping duties or countervailing tariﬀs
against subsidised imports, which claim to redress unfair trade
(rather than restrict free trade). That was in line with the monthly
average for the past ﬁve years.
But there is no room for complacency. Sometimes the dam-
age Mr Trump has inﬂicted on the global trading system must be
measured not against the status quo but against what might have
been. In his ﬁrst week in oﬃce, for example, he withdrew from
the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership, a trade and investment agreement
with 11 other countries, including Chile, Mexico and Peru. The
agreement might have added 8% to the GDP of Vietnam by 2030,
according to calculations by Peter Petri of the Peterson Institute
for International Economics and Michael Plummer of Johns
Hopkins University, and almost as much to the economy of Ma-
laysia. White House oﬃcials have said that quitting America’s
trade agreement with South Korea is also a possibility, though no
longer a priority. Such a cavalier attitude towards existing agree-
ments will make future deals harder to strike. 
Mr Trump has also quietly undermined the World Trade
Organisation, and the multilateral principles it represents, by
working around it. His government has launched an investiga-
tion into China’s abuses of intellectual property, invoking old
American legal provisions that the WTO was supposed to sup-
plant. And he has refused to begin the process of appointing new
judges to its trade tribunals.
Rather than impose sweeping tariﬀs against entire coun-
tries, Mr Trump’s administration has turned to more targeted
measures, such as anti-dumping duties, against individual pro-
ducts. These trade “remedies” can be deployed without getting
bogged down in Congress. Indeed, the administration has cho-
sen to initiate many of these investigations itself, rather than
wait for aggrieved American industries to plead for them. 

Amer ica the dutiful

How much diﬀerence will this new American trigger-hap-
piness make? Duties against dumped or subsidised products cov-
ered 3.8% of American imports at the end of 2016, according to
calculations by Chad Bown of the PIIE. The investigations now
under way could almost double that ﬁgure to 7.4%. 
Not all of the new duties will apply to emerging economies.
The threat of steel restrictions poses a bigger danger to the Euro-
pean Union and Canada than to China. And many of the more
obvious emerging-market targets have already been hit. China’s
exporters, for example, are already accustomed to such pinprick
protectionism. At the end of last year the country was subject to
139 such measures, covering 9.2% of its American sales.
So the increased use of remedies will not be fatal to emerg-
ing-market exports, but it will be a growing irritant, especially if
the countries concerned feel compelled to impose tit-for-tat ta-
riﬀs. Retaliation would be easier to resist if the administration
were to act quietly, but quietude has not been one of its virtues.
The emerging economy most at risk from Mr Trump’s trade
instincts remains Mexico, which is now locked in a diﬃcult rene-
gotiation of NAFTA. America wants to tighten the agreement’s
rules of origin, which determine what counts as a North Ameri-
can product. It wants to add provisions against currency ma-
nipulation. It also seeks a freer hand to impose duties on
dumped, subsidised or surging imports, and it wants American
courts, not NAFTA panels, to resolve investment disputes. These
and other measures, it hopes, will eliminate the big trade deﬁcits

it now runs with both the other members, Mexico and Canada.
Yet it is not clear how a trade agreement like NAFTA can
curb a trade deﬁcit. Suppose a renegotiated agreement allowed
America to impose higher tariﬀs in the name of narrowing its im-
port-export gap. Those tariﬀs would limit the demand for foreign
currencies. That would reduce their price, making them more
competitive against the dollar. That, in turn, would tend to undo
the eﬀect of the tariﬀ. 
One NAFTA member already has experience of trying to
engineer a better trade balance by ﬁat. Back in 1993, Mexico re-
quired manufacturers to export $2-worth of cars for every $1-
worth of car imports. NAFTA phased out such practices, and
Mexico’s car industry has never looked back.
If Mexico has to concede anything to keep NAFTA alive, it
might accept a ban on currency manipulation. Since both Cana-
da and Mexico let their exchange rates ﬂoat, any such prohibition
would probably remain redundant. But it would allow Ameri-
ca’s president to claim an unprecedented breakthrough: incorpo-
rating currency safeguards into a trade agreement for the ﬁrst
time. That would make a good tweet. With luck, he and his team
would then declare victory and go home.
San Luis Potosí, for its part, seems to have shrugged oﬀ the
Ford setback. About 3km east of the abandoned site, BMW is
building a new factory of its own that will eventually employ
1,500 people. “I think the city is [enjoying] one of our best times,”
says a local resident. “For sure, other companies will come at the
end of the day.” Formal employment in the state increased by
7.7% in the year to May. The governor has boasted about the pace
of job creation on Twitter, where he has over 50,000 followers. In
matters of populism, two-way trade remains strong. 7

How populism can shape emerging markets

THE SOUND OF an orchestral horn ﬁlls the hall as musi-
cians warm up for an evening performance of Rachmani-
noﬀ and Tchaikovsky. The venue is a dramatic Beaux-Arts build-
ing that started life as the central post oﬃce of Buenos Aires. It
perfectly illustrates Argentina’s pendulum swings between lib-
eralism and populism. In 1946 it doubled as a headquarters for
the charitable work of the president’s wife, Eva Perón. In 1997 the
postal service was privatised during one of Argentina’s periodic
experiments with free markets and hard money. As that came to
a grisly end in the default of 2001, bankruptcy also ensnared the
post oﬃce’s new owner, a conglomerate led by Franco Macri. 
The postal service was renationalised early in the presiden-
cy of Néstor Kirchner, who led a new wave of “post-neoliberal”
populism. In 2005 Mr Kirchner decided to turn the defunct build-
ing into a cultural centre. His wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirch-
ner, who succeeded him as president, eventually completed the
project and named the building after him. Her chosen successor
lost the 2015 presidential elections to none other than Mr Macri’s
son, Mauricio, whose government swiftly rescheduled the debts
that his father’s company still owed to the state.
The Macri government has been tidying up a lot else, too.
Among other things, it consolidated Argentina’s multiple ex-
change rates, stopped propping up the peso and steadily relaxed

currency controls. In 2016 it returned to the international capital
markets, and earlier this year it sold a bond with a 100-year matu-
rity, usually reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. 
The populism Argentina is escaping has a long history in
the region. In its 1950s heyday, the movement successfully
crossed class boundaries, scrambling left and right. It champi-
oned domestic industry, opposing a suspect international elite.
To keep these disparate coalitions together, populists tried
to give something to everyone, notes Michael Conniﬀ of San
José State University. That usually meant favouring everyone to-
day at the expense of everyone tomorrow. Populist governments
presided over public spending ﬁnanced by borrowing, prices fro-
zen by ﬁat, local industry shielded from imports and wage hikes
unmatched by productivity gains.
Ultimately, such policies proved unsustainable. But as An-
drés Velasco, a former ﬁnance minister of Chile, has pointed out,
“ultimately” can take a very long time. Before it exhausts its lim-
its, populism typically moves through several distinct phases. It
often begins in weakened, underheated economies, where ini-
tially it works well, providing a boost to spending. “Everyone
will try to scare you with the spectre of an economic collapse,”
Juan Perón wrote in 1953. “But all of this is a lie. There is nothing
more elastic than the economy.”
However, an underemployed economy is far more elastic
than one going at full tilt. Once spending is strong enough to re-
store employment, reactivate idle factories and revive imports,
populism runs into capacity constraints. Budget and trade deﬁ-
cits widen and price pressure builds.
This inﬂationary pressure typically meets with one of two
responses. It can be oﬀset by high interest rates from the central
bank, if the populist leader allows it, squeezing the private sector.
Alternatively, the inﬂationary momentum can be left unchecked
until the public clamour for price stability brings the government
down or forces a retreat. 
Where do today’s emerging economies stand in this cycle
of populism? Brazil, like Argentina, is in a post-populist phase.
The previous government, led by Dilma Rousseﬀ, was never as
reckless as the Kirchners in Argentina, but it did overspend in ad-
vance of the 2014 presidential election. Having failed to predict
the commodity downturn in the second half of that year, Brazil’s
government was shocked at how inelastic the economy proved
to be. A zealous enforcement of the ﬁscal rules provided the pre-
text for Ms Rousseﬀ’s impeachment. 
Other emerging economies are in earlier phases of the cy-
cle. Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines talks like a populist, but
has so far left his economic policy in the hands of competent
technocrats. South Africa’s Jacob Zuma used to do the same, but
has since removed two respected ﬁnance ministers in the past
couple of years, turning the Treasury over to a loyalist instead.
Turkey’s central bank, for its part, is trying to keep a lid on inﬂa-
tion, but has received little public backing from the country’s
president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. 
Perhaps the most interesting case of a “pre-populist” emerg-
ing market is Mexico. It has largely embraced macroeconomic or-
thodoxy, demonstrating its commitment to open trade and in-
vestment policies by locking itself into NAFTA. But dis-
appointing growth, widespread corruption and gang violence
have left many Mexicans dissatisﬁed. The leading candidate for
the next presidential election, due in July of 2018, is Andrés Ma-
nuel López Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, who attacks
the crookedness of the establishment and seeks a revision of
NAFTA. In some ways, he is like a mirror image of America’s pres-
ident, leaning heavily to the left just as Mr Trump leans to the
right. In their politics, as in other ways, emerging economies are
beginning to resemble their rich counterparts more closely. 7

Convergence

Merging markets

Emerging economies are becoming more like their
r ich counterparts

THESE ARE NOT your father’s emerging markets, notes
Mark Dow, a money manager who used to work for the
IMF, on his blog. The phrase alludes to a 1980s car advertisement
contrasting a range of ﬂashy new models with the tried-and-
trusted versions bought by a previous generation. Today’s
emerging markets are also diﬀerent from earlier models. But un-
like the cars, they are less exciting than their predecessors. 
In the past, they suﬀered from a chronic lack of macroeco-
nomic credibility. They could not persuade outsiders to hold
their money or their debt through thick and thin, unless they an-
chored their exchange rates to the dollar and denominated their
debt in harder currencies than their own. So they have often
struggled to oﬀset downturns by easing either monetary or ﬁscal
policy. They could not cut interest rates for fear of sinking the cur-
rency and unleashing inﬂation, and they could not cut taxes or
increase public spending without raising fears of default. They
were locked into a “procyclicality trap”.
This lack of macroeconomic leeway left them vulnerable to
rising American interest rates and sudden outﬂows of foreign
capital. It also made it harder for resource-rich economies to cope
with the vagaries of the commodity cycle. But, as this special re-
port has argued, emerging economies have begun to grow out of
these handicaps. Their central banks have earned more inﬂa-
tion-ﬁghting credibility of their own, making it easier for their
governments to sell debt in their own currency. That, in turn, has
helped to loosen the pro-cyclicality trap. 

Cycling ban

This greater macroeconomic maturity should allow emerg-
ing economies to cope better with two global dynamics that
have often scuppered them in the past: the commodity cycle and
the Fed cycle. It is therefore unlikely that the Fed’s eﬀorts to raise
interest rates and trim its balance-sheet will condemn emerging
economies to another bout of turmoil like the taper tantrum of
2013, let alone the Volcker shock of 1979-81. That shock, which left
many promising Latin American countries languishing for a de-

cade, lent credence to the idea of
a middle-income trap. But this
report has argued that this dan-
ger was never as grave as many
people believed. 
Believers in the trap often
argue 
that once developing
countries have exhausted the
easy gains from cheap labour,
they stagnate. Some worry that
even the transient advantages of
cheap labour have been eroded
by automation, exposing poor
countries to “premature dein-
dustrialisation”. But a closer
look at the evidence suggests
that industrial employment in
emerging markets has not de-
clined, it has merely migrated to
the biggest of them, China.
Moreover, this migration may
now be reversing, as Chinese
employment shifts to services,
leaving gaps for other work-
shops of the world to emerge. 
Nine of the 24 members of
the benchmark MSCI
stock-
market index are already high-
income countries, according to
the World Bank, and others are
on the cusp. Indeed, the average
income per person of the index
members, weighted by the size of their economies, is now much
closer to the bank’s high-income threshold ($12,236) than it was
when the index began in the late 1980s. 
This new maturity is also reﬂected in these countries’ ﬁnan-
cial-market performance. In the past, emerging-market equities
oﬀered investors the prospect of higher returns, subject to higher
volatility. But over the past ﬁve years they have oﬀered a combi-
nation of risk and return that sits well within developed-market
norms, according to MSCI. In their market performance and their
macroeconomic policies, the gap between emerging economies
and the developed world has narrowed. It is therefore ironic that
one of the biggest dangers emerging markets face is a downward
convergence in their politics. 
President Donald Trump professes to admire the strong-
man politics of Russia, and he covets the trade surpluses of Chi-
na. Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, believes China has
borrowed the “American system” of manufacturing protection
proposed by Alexander Hamilton in the late 18th century. He
wants Mr Trump to bring that system back home. Rising protec-
tionism in America would limit the scope for emerging econo-
mies to grow rapidly through labour-intensive manufacturing.
And the opportunity for these economies to anchor their trade
and investment policies in multilateral agreements has also di-
minished, thanks to America’s disenchantment with such deals. 
Mr Agtmael hoped that his “emerging markets” label
would distance these economies from a long list of third-world
associations: “Flimsy polyester, cheap toys, rampant corruption,
Soviet-style tractors and ﬂooded rice paddies”. By those stan-
dards emerging markets have been 80% successful, shedding all
of these associations except the third. They bear little resem-
blance to the markets of the crisis-ridden 1990s, let alone the ones
Mr Agtmael named a decade earlier. As it happens, he is now a
grandfather, and these are not his emerging markets. 7

Itgave Spain, includingCatalonia, de-mocracy, a welfare state and much greaterprosperity(until a housingbubble burst in2008). Butthe system wasmade unwieldybya decision to grantregional autonomyacrossthe country, ratherthan justto theCatalans, Basquesand Galicianswho hadlongdemanded it. And ithasnotdimin-ished Spanish conservatives’ attachmentto a centralisingtradition, saysJosé ÁlvarezJunco, a historian ofnationalism atMa-drid’sComplutense University. “They’dlike to thinkSpain islike France and Ma-drid like Paris.” Asa result, Barcelona doesnothave the statusofa de facto joint capi-tal thatitdeserves.MrRajoyisthusconstrained bypres-sure from hisbase. “The PP winselectionsthanksto its[Spanish] nationalism and ex-plicitanti-Catalanism,” saysMrÁlvarez.Overthe pastfewdays, Spanish ﬂags havestarted to appearon balconiesacrossmuch ofthe country.MrRajoy’sdogged determination,sangfroid and quietruthlessnesshelpedSpain outofitsbankingcrisisand eco-nomicslump.

Ithasschooled two generationsin its(questionable) narrative ofoppres-sion.

Until now, the independence move-menthasbeen impeccablynon-violent, al-beitconstantlyprovocative. Butthe situa-tion isvolatile. IfMrPuigdemontand MrRajoycannotbetween them swiftlytakeconstructive stepstowardsan agreementor, worse, ifMrRajoyattemptsto arrest theCatalan leader, thatcould easilychange. 7THE proposal came outofnowhere.Afteryearsofswattingdown Ukrai-nian callsforinternational peacekeepingforces, VladimirPutin changed courseahead ofthe UN General Assemblylastmonth, puttingforward hisown plan forso-called blue helmetsin eastern Ukraine.Oﬃcialsin Kievand the Westdismissedthe Russian oﬀerasa cynical ploy.

As re-centlyaslastspring, Russian oﬃcials main-tained thatthe Ukrainian governmentwould soon collapse and thatthe Ukrai-nian elite, asone Kremlin adviserput itatthe time, would “come to theirsenses” andreturn to Russia’sembrace. The situation in Ukraine nowseems tobe turninginto “a stone around the neck”,saysFyodorLukyanovofthe Council onForeign and Defence Policy, a Russian gov-ernmentadvisorybody. The hopesthatUkraine would implode orthatMoscow-friendlyforcescould take powerin presi-dential electionsdue in 2019 have evapo-rated. The international backdrop has tilt-ed too.

When she could getherwordsout, MrsMayconfusinglycombined a de-fence ofthe free marketwith promises ofmore intervention in highereducation, en-stituentwho feltunable to vote Conserva-tive because she wasa nurse. “Thatwasallshe feltshe needed to say,” he reported.When itcomesto publicﬁnances, MrClev-erlyargued thatthe Conservativessimplyneeded to remind votersthatBritain’sﬁ-nancial messwasLabour’sfault: “Thatistheircosmicrole in life: to screwthings up,so we can come and ﬁxthem.” MrsMaydoubled down on thistheme. She wasin-troduced bya video outliningthe eco-nomicmessinherited bythe Conserva-tivesin 2010. Butseven yearshave passedand such explanationsare wearingthin.JeremyCorbyn haunted the event. Theprime minister, chancellorand foreign sec-retaryreferred to Labour’sleaderbyname20 timesin theirspeeches, havingbarelymentioned him atlastyear’sconference.Yetthe Toriesstill seem unsure howto at-tackhim. MrCorbyn wasvariouslypor-trayed asa pantomime villain and a threatto the nation. Membersmooed theirassentasMrJohnson laid into “thatNATO-bash-ing, Trident-scrapping, would-be abolisherofthe British army”. Philip Hammond, thechancellor, kicked oﬀhisspeech with a his-torylesson on Britain in the 1970sand thenawhistle-stop tourofcountrieswhere so-cialism hasbroughtmisery. Some minis-tersleftthe impression thattheirprioritywassimplyto blockLabour, ratherthangovern. “KeepingCorbyn outseemsto meadutyofanysensible politician, particu-larlya Conservative politician,” said Da-mian Green, the de facto deputyprimeminister, to a three-quartersemptyfringe.Brexit, skated overquicklybyMrs May,created the mostexcitementamongat-tendees, especiallywhen anyone suggest-ed itwould be hard, fastand easy.

Itwasthe ﬁrstnews thatBritain’sﬁfth-biggestairline had ceasedtradingand wasin administration.

Over30 aircraftwere hired tobringbackabout110,000 passengersfromabroad in whatwasbilled asthe country’sbiggestpeacetime repatriation.

Greybull boughtMon-arch in 2014, when the airline wasalreadystruggling, from the Swiss-Italian Mante-gazza familywho had setitup in 1968.Greybull pumped moneyinto Monarch,butthe airline had still been expected tolose over£100m nextyear, said Monarch’sboss, AndrewSwaﬃeld.Monarch had a good businessﬂying toEgyptand Tunisia. Butserviceswerestopped to both destinationsin 2015 afterthe bombingofa Russian airlinerover theSinai peninsula and the massshooting ofmostlyBritish holidaymakerson a beachatSousse. The numberofpassengersﬂyingfrom Britain to north Africa fell from177,000 in August2016 to 95,000 in August2017. The fall in the pound since June 2016compounded Monarch’swoes, asmanyofitscosts, such asfuel, were in dollars.More important, the airline failed toadaptto the changingaviation market. Itwascreated to service the boom in packageholidays. Itsﬁrstcharterﬂighttook oﬀfromLuton airport, where the companywasheadquartered, forSpain.

Despitecuttingcosts, Monarch could notachievethe economiesofscale to compete with itsrivals. AirBerlin and Alitalia wentbust ear-lierthisyearforsimilarreasons.

Heisalso gaﬀe-prone. The daybefore MrsMay’sbigspeech to the partyconferencehe joked, to nervouslaughterfrom hisfellowTories, thatSirte, in northernLibya, could become “the nextDubai” iftheycould “clearthe dead bodiesaway”.So whydoesn’tthe prime ministersackhim? One reason, aswith almosteverythingin British politics, lies inBrexit. Sackinga man whose alliescallhim the “godfatherofBrexit” mightupsetthe delicate balance offorcesin the cabi-net. Anotherreason isMrJohnson’spopularityin hisparty. AYouGovpollfound thathe isfavourite amongpartymembersto be the nextleader. The DailyTelegraph, a Tory-leaningnewspaper,splashed hisconference speech on itscoverwith the headline, “The roaringlion”. MrJohnson knowshowto cheerup the Conservative troopsata timewhen itisall too easyto give in to despair.Nevertheless, the party’spatience iswearingthin. Several ToryMPssuch asSarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen calledforMrJohnson to be sacked afterhisLibya remarks. Oﬀthe record, Tories fromall sidesofthe party, includingsomeBrexiteers, were happyto tell journaliststhatMrJohnson’stime wasup. He alsohasthe airoflastyear’sman.

Itis themain reason whythe paygap betweenmen and women in rich countriesisnolongernarrowing. Employersviewlonghoursasa sign ofcommitmentand leader-ship potential. Butfrom scarce, pricey childcare to shortschool days, the world is or-ganised forfamilieswith a parentathome—and thatisusuallythe mother.In the rich and middle-income coun-triesthatmake up the OECD, the medianwage ofa woman workingfull-time is85%be a problem forﬁrms—and forsociety.BHPBilliton, a miningcompany, hasfoundthatsiteswith more women are run moresafely. Heavilymale police forcesand fe-male nursingcorpsare unlikelyto have thebestmixofskills, experience and prioritiesto deal with crime victimsand patients ofthe opposite sex. One theoryforwhyboysdo worse than girlsin school isthe short-age ofmale academicrole models.The genderpaygap would shrinkifmen moved into female-dominated jobsand vice versa. Butin America such work-place genderintegration stalled about a de-cade ago aftersteadilyincreasingfor morethan two decades. Astudyof12 Europeancountriesconcluded thatbetween 1995and 2010 the share offemale workersinmostoccupationschanged little. Asimilarpattern hasbeen found in Australia.Two roads divergeMen and women are free to studywhattheywant, and discrimination atwork hasbeen banned fordecades. Butthere is plen-tyofevidence thatworkplace segregation,and men’sand women’sdiﬀeringcareerpaths, cannotbe explained awayasa mat-terofdiﬀeringpreferences.Research in Canada hascompared reac-tionsto adsforthe same jobsthatused ste-reotypicallymasculine words(leader,competitive and so on) orfeminine ones(such assupport, interpersonal and under-stand). Women found the “masculine”jobslessappealing, butnotbecause theyfelttheywould be unable to do them. Theyread the wordsasa signal ofa male-dominated workplace, where theywouldnotbelong.Stereotypesthatdiscourage men from thatofa man. Thisisnot, asmanyassume,because employerspaya woman lessthantheywould have paid a man in herplace.Data from 25 countriescollected byKornFerry, a consultancy, showthatwomenearn 98% asmuch asmen who do the samejob forthe same employer. The real reasonistwofold. Women outnumbermen in po-sitionswith lowersalariesand littlechance ofpromotion. And men and wom-en are segregated between occupationsand industries; those where women pre-dominate payless.Justa ﬁfth ofseniorexecutives in G7countriesare female. Acrossthe EuropeanUnion supervisorsare more likelyto bemale, even when mostoftheirunderlingsare female. Nearly70% ofworkingwomenin the EU are in occupationswhere atleast60% ofworkersare female. The top fourjobsdone byAmerican women—teacher,nurse, secretaryand health aide—are all atleast80% female. Occupationsdominated bywomenhave lowerstatusand pay. Primaryteach-ersin the OECDearn 81% ofthe average forgraduate jobs. Nursesearn lessthan policeoﬃcers; cleanerslessthan caretakers.Women’slowerearningsmean thatafterdivorcingorbeingwidowed, theyoftenend up poor. And skewed workforcescanMen, women and workThe gendergapWomen still earn a lotless than men, despite decades ofequal-paylaws. Why?InternationalThe EconomistOctober7th2017 International5912female-dominated jobsare atleastas in-grained. Florence Nightingale, who estab-lished the principlesofmodern nursing inthe 1890s, believed thatmen’s“hard andhorny” handsmade them unsuitable forthe job, “howevergentle theirhearts”.Some American nursingschoolsstartedadmittingmen onlyin 1981, aftera Su-preme Courtruling. Aplethora ofprogrammesand cam-paignsencourage girlsinto science and en-gineering. And theynowhave role modelsaplenty. Butcampaignsto getboysintoteachingand nursingare fewand farbe-tween. Men who become nursesoftenstumble into the job. MariusMalmo at theStavangerUniversityHospital in Norwayexplainsthat, afterhe failed to get into thepolice academy, a policeman oﬀeredfriendlyadvice: nursing, he said, used thesame “people skills”. He decided to try itfora yearbefore reapplyingto the police,butloved nursingand stayed. He says helikesintensive care and operatingtheatres,because theyare “where the action is”.Neitherchoice ofﬁeld norlackof ambi-tion can explain whythe share ofwomenshrinkshigherup the careerladder, even inindustriesthatwomen dominate. The pro-portion ofbusinessand managementde-greesearned bywomen hasgrown steadi-ly, butthatofwomen in managerial andseniorjobshasnotkeptpace. In Americaabouthalfofcollege degreesin businessawarded since 2000 have gone to women,butthe share ofseniorexecutiveswho arefemale hasremained stuckatone in ﬁve.Women used to be lesslikelyto ask forpromotion. No longer: a surveybyMcKin-seyin 2016 found thatwomen in corporateAmerica asked atthe same rate asmen. Italso found thatwomen and men were pro-moted atsimilarrates, exceptatthe lowestrungsofthe careerladder, where womenlagged behind. Apossible reason isthatmanagersare reluctantto promote womenwho are startingfamilies, orare likely to doso soon. Itso happensthatthe opportunity forthe critical ﬁrstpromotion often coincideswith wantingto starta family. Data fromBritain showthatthe age atwhich wom-en’spaystartsto fall behind men’stracksthe age atwhich theytypicallyhave theirﬁrstchild (see charton nextpage). ClaudiaGoldin ofHarvard Universityhasfound asimilarpattern forcollege-educated Amer-ican women.

Only13-37% offatherssaid theyhad done so, ofwhom more than halfsaidtheirpartnerhad also scaled back. When women give priorityto caringfortoddlerstheyfall behind. ArecentAmerican studyputthe motherhood pen-alty—the average bywhich women’sfu-ture wagesfall—at4% perchild, and 10% forthe highest-earning, mostskilled whitewomen. ABritish mother’swagesfall by2% foreach yearshe isoutofthe workforce,and by4% ifshe hasgood school-leavingqualiﬁcations.

She had beensure thata part-time oradministrative jobwasheronlypossible route backto work.Some newmothersleave theirjobs be-cause theypreferto be theirchildren’smain carers. Buttheyare also inﬂuencedbycensoriousattitudes. In manycountriesthe common opinion isthathavinga work-ingmotherisharmful forpre-school chil-dren. Germanscall a workingmotherofsmall children a Rabenmutter(raven-moth-er). When Anna, an academicin Berlin, re-turned to workfull-time hernine-month-old daughterwasthe youngestchild thenurseryhad evertaken. “Theyhad no ideawhatto do with her,” she says. AGermanfathersayshismother-in-lawlamentedthatputtingtheirtoddlersin child carewould turn them into “drug-dealers”.Often, the high costofchild care makesthe decision to leave worka forced one. InAmerica full-time child care costs85% ofthe median rent. And even where itis sub-sidised, mothersoften go part-time be-cause the school dayendslongbefore theworkingone. Butpart-time jobsare usuallyacareerdead-end. Manywomen switch to jobsrequiringlesseducation orexperience. Nearlya thirdofworkingwomen in Britain saytheyareoverqualiﬁed fortheirjobs, comparedwith lessthan a quarterofmen.

Men were two to three times less likely than womento think that, in their family, the majority of household and child-care duties fell on thewoman’s shoulders. They were more likely to say that such tasks were split equally. When we asked which partner had scaled back at work when their ﬁrst child arrived, wefound another perception gap. Both men and women were less likely to say that theirpartner had made adjustments than members of the opposite sex were to say they hadmade adjustments themselves. Perceptions in France diﬀered most: 55% of women saidthat they, and only they, slowed down at work, twice as high as the share of men who saidthat only their partners did so. Though it is unclear who is more accurate, many peopleare clearly ignorant about the reality of their partners’ lives. And even if men are open todoing more at home so their wives can do more at work, the necessity may not occur tothem. Gender equality could be boosted by some frank kitchen-table conversations.

Butmanyneverreturn because theycannotbear thethoughtofleavinga newborn in child care,orbecause payingforitwould wipe out allormostofwhattheyearn. When maternityleave islongerthan ayear, itreduceswomen’soverall participa-tion in the workforce and widensthe gen-derpaygap, saysOlivierThévenon of theOECD. Longperiodsawayfrom workcanmake skillsrusty. And too-generousar-rangementscan backﬁre. AGerman wom-an hasthe rightto return to herjob afterthree years’ maternityleave. In manycountriesmothersofyoungchildren areharderthan otheremployeesto ﬁre. Thediﬃcultyofcoveringforsuch longab-sences, and the fearthatthe occasional un-sackable motherwill slackwhen she re-turnsto work, mayputﬁrmsoﬀhiring orpromotingyoungwomen, even thoughsuch discrimination isillegal.In the 1970sthe Scandinavian countrieswere the ﬁrstto oﬀerparental leave, to beshared asparentswish. Butfewmen tookit. Makingthe paymore generousand ear-markingsome ofitforfathershelped. InSweden and Norway, which replace 80-100% ofearnings, about90% offathersnowtake parental leave. In Germanyatwo-month bonusforfatherswho takesome ofthe shared parental leave in-creased take-up bynewfathersfrom 21% to34% between 2008 and 2014. Ifno parental leave isreserved for fa-thers, couplesusuallydecide thatthemothershould take all ofit, partlybecauseshe hasstayed athome post-partum andtherefore knowsthe ropes. Thatdecisioncan shape a couple’sfuture, saysJeremyDaviesofthe Fatherhood Institute, a chari-ty, asitconﬁrmsthe motherasthe parent-ingexpert. Then itiseasierto relegate hercareerto second place.

In Britain,where some parental leave can be sharedbutpaternitypayislow, manymen give upthe idea oftakinga careerbreakwhen theyrealise justhowmuch itwould cost, saysMrDavies. “So progressive couplesend uplike familiesin the 1950s.” Seeminglygender-neutral policies forparentsmaybe used byfathersand moth-ersin diﬀerentways. AfterBritain expand-ed parental leave forfathers, forexample,some male academicsused theirleave towrite booksratherthan to do child care,thusenhancingtheirpromotion prospects. Children do notstop needingto belooked afterwhen theystartto walk.AmongOECD countries, greaterpublicprovision ofchild care and education forchildren aged underﬁve isstronglycorre-lated with higheremploymentratesformothersofyoungchildren. One ten-coun-trystudyconcluded thathalvingthe priceofchild care increasesthe total number ofhoursworked bymothersby7-10%.

On October3rd he paid a hastily-ar-ranged visitto TransportforLondon (TfL),the regulatorthatrecentlyruled that Uberwasnot“ﬁtand proper” to hold an operat-Japanese tech ﬁrm run byMasayoshi Son.One ofMrSon’smain conditionswasthatpowerbe shifted to more recentinves-tors.

Bench-mark, a venture-capital ﬁrm and an earlyinvestorin Uber, agreed to drop a lawsuitagainstMrKalanick.All could still unravel.

Lastyear, Ireland wasorderedto recover€13bn from Apple—smashingallpastrecordsforEUcorporate-taxcases.Aswith Apple, the commission con-cluded thatAmazon received illegal stateaid—in the retailer’scase between 2006and 2014—through a tax-cuttingarrange-mentunavailable to itsrivals. Itcame in theform ofa rulingfrom Luxembourg’staxau-thority, known asa “comfortletter”. Ama-zon accordinglymoved intellectual prop-ertyofvarioustypesinto a Luxembourgpartnership thatserved asan intermedi-arybetween Amazon’sEuropean opera-tions—whose headquarterswere a sepa-rate Luxembourgentity—and itsAmericanparent. Asa partnership, the go-betweenwasnotsubjectto taxunderLuxembourglaw(the statutorycorporate rate is29.22%).The European operatingﬁrm was. The operatingcompanywasrequiredto payto the partnership substantial royal-tiesfor, amongotherthings, the right to usethe Amazon name, therebyshiftinglots ofproﬁtto the untaxed entity. The commis-sion arguesthatthe level ofroyalty pay-mentswasinﬂated and did notreﬂect eco-nomicreality. Itsaysthe arrangementallowed Amazon to avoid taxon three-quartersofall proﬁtson itssalesin the EU(which the companydoesnotdisclose). Both Luxembourgand Amazon denywrongdoing.

Theﬁrm’s“bigshort” in early2007, when itbetthatsubprime securi-tieswould tumble, helped itto bookproﬁtsof$14bn in 2008-09and to perform relativelywell duringthe worstﬁnancial crisisfor80 years. Goldman also valuescandour, atleastinside the ﬁrm. Inthisspirititistime to acknowledge thatthe bank’sstrategicdirec-tion isbeginningto feel like a bum trade. Itsdefence isthatitis noworse than itsgroup ofpeers, butbeingaverage on Wall Streetis amug’sgame and the antithesisofthe Goldman way.While outsidersthinkthatGoldman’salumni run the world,on Wall Streetthe ﬁrm’saura hasdimmed.

Inevitablythatgivesrise to doubtsaboutthe ﬁrm’sstrategy,which isto slash costsand sittight, hopingthe industry’snuclearwinterends. So while lowerbonusesmean the paybill is downby42% since 2007, there hasbeen no wholesale retreatfrom themain businesses—advisingand lendingto companies, trading se-curitiesand assetmanagement. Meanwhile, the bankisgrap-plingwith three problems: mediocre proﬁtability, unconvincingcapital allocation and a trickymanagementsuccession.Backwhen itwasa partnership, Goldman wasmore proﬁt-able than Facebookisnow. Itsreturn on equitywas38% in 1998,before itwentpublic. In 2007 itsROEwas29%, butitfell to 9% inthe mostrecentquarter. Two-thirdsofthisdrop reﬂects toughercapital rules. Itslevel ofROEmatchesthe average ofJPMorgan,Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and BankofAmerica.

Forevery$100 ofsuch assetsGoldman made $1.9 ofpre-taxproﬁtsin 2016,lessthan the peergroup’saverage of$2.0. Each bankhasa diﬀer-entmixofbusinesses, butyoucan compare Goldman to a best-in-class“clone” made up ofJPMorgan’sinvestmentbankingandasset-managementdivisions. The clone made $2.2. (Goldmansaysthatthiscomparison istoo crude.)Mediocre proﬁtabilityreﬂectsunwieldyassetallocation.Goldman hastoiled to cutitsbalance-sheet, particularly in bond-trading.

The tradingarmtiesup two-thirdsofthis, especiallyitsderivativesbook. Itslend-ingoperation hasgrown, with exposuresto higher-riskﬁrms—those with a creditratingofBBBorless—rising151% to $129bn.Goldman doesnotreveal the ROEsofthese operatingseg-mentsbuttheycan be imputed. In 2016 the tradingunitappearsto have had an ROEof7% and itslendingunit5%. Mostﬁrmswould have wielded the knife deeper. The bankhasnewpro-jects, such asitssmall online consumerbank. Ithasreturned cashto shareholders. Butitscore strategyisto waitfortrading to recov-er. Thismayhappen. Volatilitymaypickup, European competi-torsmightquitthe game, oremergingeconomiescould boom. Itislessclearhowanyofthese eventswould liftthe tradingdi-vision’sreturnsto a punchylevel. There have been highs andlowssince the crisis, butitsaverage ROEhasbeen only10%, basedon currentcapital rules. Ifthe terrible trio ofBarclays, DeutscheBankand CreditSuisse quitthe tradinggame altogether andGoldman won a quarteroftheirbusiness, itstradingdivision’sROEwould be a lukewarm 9%. China’smarketsare boomingbutlocal ﬁrmsdominate, and Goldman isweakin India.Goldman’s“hang-in-there” strategyfeedsinto the discussionoversuccession. Lloyd Blankfein hasbeen the bosssince 2006,and—itmustbe said—overthe entire period hasthe best record ofanybankerotherthan Jamie Dimon atJPMorgan. Butmore re-centlyMrBlankfein mayhave been too tolerantofthe trading di-vision, where he and several lieutenantsmade theirnames.The problem isthateven ifhe goes, there isno quick ﬁx. Theﬁrm’sotherbusinesses—advisingcompaniesand assetmanage-ment—are excellentbutmature. Afewromanticsimagine Gold-man could return to beinga partnership, butthatissilly. In 1998the partnershad $6bn ofcapital tied up in it; nowtheywouldneed $97bn to buyit. MightGoldman combine with a commer-cial bank, a model itﬂirted with in the 1990sand which JPMorganhasperfected? The onlymajorlenderwithouta biginvestmentbankisWellsFargo, and the combined ﬁrm would have $3trn ofassets, enough to make regulatorsululate.The wonderyearsGoldman saysthatithasa “record ofadaptingto changingenvi-ronments” and notesthatitsaverage ROEoverthe pastten yearswaseightpercentage pointsabove the average ofitspeers. Thislegacymeansthatthe board will probablystickwith the plan andthe man foratleasta year. Afterthat, mediocre performancewould corrode morale and upsetexternal shareholders, whoown 90% ofthe bank. Ifno tradingupsurge comes, Goldman mayhave to shrinkmore. Itsreign hasbeen short. In the 1980sitwasnotyettop dogon Wall Streetand wasa nonentityabroad.

Sarah Anzia, atthe University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, examined 219 citiesbetween 2005 and 2014 and found thatthemean increase in theirreal pension costswas69%; higherpension costsin those cit-ieswere associated with fallsin public-sec-toremploymentand capital spending. The problem islikelyto getworse.Moody’s, a ratingagency, putsthe totalshortfall ofAmerican public-sectorpen-sion plansataround $4trn. Thatgap doesnothave to be closed atonce, butit doesmean thatcontributionsbyemployers(and hence taxpayers) will increase evenmore than theyalreadyhave (see chart).In a sense, thisisa meetingofirresist-ible force and immovable object. The forceisthe risingcostofprovidinga pensionlinked to a worker’sﬁnal salary(known ascareerrecords, and thusmaynotbeneﬁtfrom a full pension. Squaringthiscircle isnoteasy. Statesand local governmentshave tried to cutthe costto taxpayersofpension beneﬁts invariousways. First, theyhave oﬀered lessgenerouspensionsto newemployees. Butthatleavesthe bulkofthe liabilities intact.Second, theyhave reduced the extenttowhich pensionswill increase with inﬂa-tion via a cost-of-livingadjustment; thiswill save moneyin the longterm but, withinﬂation so low, doesnotsave much in theshortterm. Third, theyhave asked employ-eesto contribute more from theircurrentwages—ie, take a paycut.These changeshave made onlya smalldentin the problem. Biggersavingswouldhave to come in two areas. One seemsoutofthe question—cuttingpaymentsto thosewho have alreadyretired orthe beneﬁtsthatworkershave alreadyaccrued. Thetrickierissue iswhetheritispossible to cutthe future beneﬁtsofexistingworkers. A45-year-old, forexample, could keep the DBpension based on hispastearnings, but hisfuture pension would be based on a de-ﬁned-contribution (DC) system in whichthe ﬁnal income wasnotguaranteed.Makingsuch a change isdiﬃcult; itisunpopularwith workers, and in somestates, possiblyillegal. Arkansas, Illinoisand NewYorkhave deemed itunconstitu-tional to cutthe rightsofexistingemploy-ees. In otherstates, the courtshave ruledthatrights, once promised, can never bewithdrawn. California’sSupreme Courtmaygetthe chance to overturn thisrulingthisyearorearlyin 2018 because oftwocasescurrentlyin the system.The issue cannotbe tackled overnight.AsRob Dubow, the directorofﬁnance ofthe CityofPhiladelphia, pointsout, “Theproblem tookdecadesto create so itwill adeﬁned-beneﬁtorDBscheme).

Expertscan diﬀer, itseems. But smallchangesin assumptionscan make a hugediﬀerence to the amountemployersneedto contribute. Accordingto the NationalAssociation ofState RetirementAdminis-trators, cuttingthe return assumption byaquarterofa percentage pointincreases therequired contribution rate (asa proportionofpayroll) bytwo to three points.In consequence, itisin no one’sinterestto make more realisticassumptionsaboutfuture returns.

So the game of“extendand pretend” continues.Butthe dangerofoptimisticprojectionsisthat, ifmissed, theysimplycreate a big-gerlong-term hole. David Crane isa cam-paignerforpension reform and a formeradviserto Arnold Schwarzenegger, Califor-nia’sgovernorfrom 2003 to 2011. In aspeech aslongago as2010, he pointed outthatin 1999, CalPERS(the fund thatcoversmoststate employees) had assumed an8.25% long-term return, and an annual pen-sion costto the state of$450m. Overthe fol-lowingten years, thataverage wasactually$2.3bn. One reason whycostsrose so fast isthatthe state granted generousbeneﬁt in-creasesto itsworkersin 1999, based onthose optimisticreturn assumptions. The dangerofthe currentoptimism isthatthe American stockmarketisata re-cord high, and, even usingtheirsanguinereturn assumptions, state and local pen-sion plansare only72% funded.

There will be no easyanswers. 7“THE retirement-savingscrisisis awomen’scrisis,” saysSallie Kraw-check, co-founderofEllevest, a ﬁnancial-advice ﬁrm forwomen in America. Whenitcomesto retirementincome, women arefarworse-oﬀthan men. The genderpen-sion-gap maybe lesswell-known than thegenderpay-gap, butitisin factfar larger. Amongthose retired in the EU, womenon average receive 39% lessin pension in-come—from state and workplace pen-sions—than men do (see chart). Thisputswomen atgreaterriskofold-age poverty.The European Institute forGenderEquali-ty, a think-tank, warned in a studyin 2015thatitalso makesthem more likelyto staywith abusive partners. Reformsto Euro-pean pensions, tyingbeneﬁtseven closerto individual contributionsand thusin-come, mean the gap maywiden further. The schism isprimarilya reﬂection ofthe labourmarket. Women on averageworkfewerhoursthan men, in lesswell-paid jobs, forfeweryears. So ofcoursetheirworkplace pensionsare smaller. Butretirementismore costlyforwomen. In Eu-rope theyretire on average earlierthanmen and live ﬁve yearslonger. Longer livesare nota problem ifthe state ora companyhaspromised to paya ﬁxed income untildeath. In the EU, annuitiesare notallowedto discriminate on gendergroundsand soare a betterdeal forwomen than men. Butwomen also have longerperiodsofillnessand are twice aslikelyto live alone in oldage. And theytend to be more cautiousthan men, often preferringcash orﬁxed-in-come investments. Mercer, a consultancy,found thatwomen are 67% more likelythan men to investin a defensive fundwith a lowerexpected level ofgrowth. Sowomen withouta ﬁxed pension tend to beworse oﬀ.The gap isgreatestin countrieswhereworkplace pensionsmake up a bigchunkofretirementsavings, orwhere state bene-ﬁts—such associal securityin America—are linked to lifetime contributions. In theNetherlands, which hasa longtradition ofquasi-mandatoryworkplace pensions,men are notonlymore likelyto have aworkpension pot, butitwill also be twiceaslarge, because mostwomen workpart-time and retire earlier. In Germanythe gap isfarmore pro-nounced in the westthan in the east,where more women work, partlya hang-overofthe communistpast. Then womenworked almostasmuch asmen and pen-sionswere tied to yearsworked, notin-come. Thathelpsexplain the small pen-sion gapsamongthe retired in formerSovietcountries. Such historical legaciesmustbe keptin mind when projectingwhatthe gapsmightbe in the future, saysOle Beier, from the OECD,a think-tank.Afewrecentdevelopments, however,mayaggravate the problem, notablyasteadyshiftfrom publicto private pen-sions. Thisisvital ifstate pensions are to beaﬀordable associetiesage. Butunlesswomen earn and save more, the gap willwiden. And afteryearsofprogressin manycountries, the paydiﬀerential betweenmen and women hasstopped narrowing.Add to thisthe growingdivorce ratesamongthe over-60s(in America theyhavedoubled since 1990), and itiscleara stormisbrewing, mosturgentlyforwomen en-teringretirement. Some women can counton spousal pensions, othersmaynotbe solucky. Women startingtheircareershavemostcause forconcern. Theirpensionswill depend more than previousgenera-tions’ on whattheyputin.Prescriptionsfornarrowingthe gap inworkforce payare well-known. Accesstoaﬀordable child care, paid parental leaveand ﬂexible workingall help. Abolishinglowerretirementagesforwomen, asishappeningin mostOECD countries, willalso help. Buteven so, forthe immediatefuture women are likelyto continue tohave diﬀerentcareertrajectoriesfrommen’s, with more breaks—forraisingchil-dren and caringforthe elderly—and fewerpromotions. Diane Garnick, from TIAA, aﬁnancial-servicesﬁrm, saysthatmanywomen thinkthatso longastheyputthe(default) recommended share oftheirpayinto a savingspottheyare on track, even ifin absolute termsthe numberistoo low.She suggeststhatpartofthe solutioncould be foremployersto nudge women tocontribute a largershare oftheirpay to-wardstheirpension than men do. She esti-matesthatan American woman graduatestartingon the same salaryasa man willneed to save 18% ofhersalarycomparedwith a man’s10% to achieve the same re-tirementoutcome overa lifetime. MrBeieraddsthatitalso makesa bigdiﬀerence ifpension savingscontinue duringmaterni-tyleave, thanksto (near) full maternity pay. Merelyfocusingon equality, however,isnotenough. The chartmightsuggest thatfemale pensionersin Estonia are sittingpretty. Yetamongthe 75-plussersin the EU,none ispoorerthan an Estonian; and al-mostnowhere isthe gap between maleand female life-expectancygreater, mean-ingolderwomen often live alone in pover-tyorclose to it.

Britain isto join a longlistnextyear. Since the poorboth spend a higherproportion oftheirincome on food andtend to eatlesshealthily, theyare themain targetsofsuch taxes.

In Sep-temberLegend, the largestshareholder ofLenovo Computers, announced thatitwould acquire 89.9% ofBanque Inter-nationale à Luxembourg, the oldestprivatebankin the Grand Duchy, from a Qataricompany. Legend said itwanted to providebankingservicesto companiestakingpartin China’sﬂagship “Beltand Road” projectto build a latter-daySilkRoad to Europe.OtherChinese ﬁrmshave boughtsmallerstakesin European banks. In MayHNA Group, a part-ownerofHainan Air-lines, increased itsholdingin DeutscheBankto 9.9%, becomingitslargestshare-holder. Fosun, a bigconsumergroup, owns24% ofMillennium BCP, Portugal’slargestlisted bank. Unlike Geely, however, Le-gend, HNAand Fosunhave experience inthe Chinese ﬁnancial sector.After2014 Chinese companieshadsharplyincreased theirdirectinvestmentin foreign companies(see chart). Largeﬁrmsmade high-proﬁle acquisitionsofproperty, sportsteams, ﬁlm companiesand otherassetswith tenuousconnectionsto theircore activities. Concernsover capi-tal outﬂowand corporate debtled the Chi-nese governmentto introduce regulationslimitingoutward investment. Geely’spurchase ofSaxo BanksuggeststhatChinese companiesare graduallyre-gainingtheirappetitesforforeign deals,even outside theircore businesses.

Since the 1980s, however, tax-dodgershave been spoiltforchoice: theycan hide assetsanywhere from the Baha-masto HongKong. The percentage ofglo-bal wealth held oﬀshore hasincreased dra-matically. Butithasbeen hard to say howmuch thatis, and who ownsit. Fewoﬀshore centresused to disclosesuch data. Butin 2016 manyauthorised theBankforInternational Settlements(BIS) tomake bankingstatisticspubliclyavailable.Usingthese data, a newstudybyAnnetteAlstadsaeter, NielsJohannesen and Gabri-el Zucman, three economists, concludesthattaxhavenshoard wealth equivalent toabout10% ofglobal GDP. Thisaveragemasksbigvariations. Russian assetsworth50% ofGDPare held oﬀshore; countriessuch asVenezuela, Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emiratesclimb into the60-70% range. Britain and continental Eu-rope come in at15%, butScandinavia atonlya fewpercent. One conclusion isthathigh taxrates,like those in DenmarkorSweden, do notdrive people oﬀshore. Rather, higher oﬀ-shore wealth iscorrelated with factorssuch aspolitical and economicinstabilityand an abundance ofnatural resources.Proximityto Switzerland also remainsagood indicator. Butassetsheld there havedeclined since the ﬁnancial crisis(seechart), whereasthose in HongKonggrewsixfold from 2007 to 2015. The territorynowrankssecond behind Switzerland. MrZucman attributesthisto foreign pressureon Swissbanksfollowingrecentscandals,coupled with a surge ofwealth in Asia.

Yetplentyofdata are still missing.

Researchersmade esti-matesto plugthe gap, buttheirﬁgures arelikelyto be conservative. MrZucman thinkstaxhavensshouldbe forced to be more transparent, and thatinstitutionsthatfacilitate taxevasionshould face stiﬀerpenalties.

So itgoesfor “initialcoin oﬀerings”, orICOs. Anewone bya ﬁrm called POWinvitesFacebookusersto claim tokensfornothing; when theylater be-come convertible into othertokens, the ﬁrstto take advantage ofthe oﬀercould “become worth $124bn…makingthem the richestperson on Earth”, the blurb says. Nota bad return forno moneyinvested and no riskborne. Howeverbizarre, bubblesare hard toresist: no one wantsto be the onlyone oftheirfriends leftout.Theycan also be ﬁnanciallyruinous. Butgamblingon a craze,even a highlydubiousone, can be aboutmore than blind greed.The ICOboom isan outgrowth ofthe emerging, occasionallyinscrutable world ofcryptocurrencies. These are a form ofmon-ey(bitcoin and etherare examples) used in transactions whichare recorded on a distributed publicledgercalled a blockchain.An ICOisa scheme to raise fundsforan enterprise written into acontracton a blockchain. To buyin, puntersuse cryptocurrencyto payfortokens. Those tokensbecome the workingcurrencywithin the newenterprise. Anewsocial network, forinstance,mightfund itselfthrough an ICO, then allowusersto spend theirtokenson goodsorserviceson the networkonce itisup and run-ning. In successful projects, demand fortokensshould rise andearlyinvestorsshould proﬁt. ICOsresemble both a newform ofcrowdfunding, and a technological leapfrogoverthe regulationsthathem in more orthodoxfundingstrategies. Theyare also allthe rage. Ether, the currencyused on the ethereum blockchain, isup bymore than 2,400% againstthe dollaroverthe pastyear andboastsa marketcapitalisation ofnearly$28bn. ICOshave so farraised nearly$2bn in 2017.Thislookslike irrationalityin action, bound to end in tears.Why, then, should the partycontinue? Maniasare asold asﬁ-nance, and economistshave devoted plentyoftime to studyingthem. Though often blamed on easycredit, human nature alonecan goad a ragingbull. AsCharlesKindlebergerexplained in hisbook“Manias, Panicsand Crashes”, enthusiasm fornewmarketsortechnologiesfrequentlyresultsin excessive optimism, whichultimatelycollideswith realityin a spectacularcrash.Thatseemsatoddswith the idea ofan eﬃcientmarket, inwhich assetpricesreﬂectthe discounted value ofexpected futureproﬁts, and in which easy, risk-free moneyisa rarity. Butecono-mistshave learned thateﬃciencyisa somewhatloose constrainton markets. The discounted value ofdividends, forinstance, va-riesbymuch lessovertime than stockmarketindices, meaningthatpeople’sviewsofthe state ofthe world gyrate more than his-torysuggeststheyshould. Marketsare betteratsetting pricesforindividual stocksthan in aggregate—in Paul Samuelson’swords,theyare “micro-eﬃcientand macro-ineﬃcient”.Yetthatmaybebecause individual stocksare more likelyto provide well-in-formed investorswith opportunitiesfora quickno-risk proﬁt.TheICOcraze certainlyappearsto entail a departure from rea-sonable values. Such deviationscan happen when takingthepessimisticside ofa betisdiﬃcult—shortingstocks, forinstance(ie, sellingsecuritiesthe investordoesnotown in the hope theprice will fall). In some accountsofthe tech boom ofthe 1990s,the small ﬂoatofmanynewtech stocksmade shortingthemnearlyimpossible; asissuance increased, however, bears couldhave theirsay, and marketstanked. Housing, too, isfamouslyhard to short; in the global crisisthose fewﬁnanciers who foundvehiclesto betagainstmortgage-backed securitieseventuallymade a fortune. There are some opportunitiesto shortcryptocur-rencies, butessentiallynone forICOtokens(somethingthose in-tendingto buymightreﬂecton, ifreﬂection istheir thing).Human quirksalso playa role. RobertShiller, who helpedcreate the subﬁeld nowknown asbehavioural ﬁnance (and wonaNobel prize), reckonsthatideasaboutmarketsspread like anepidemic. Atanypointin time, multiple storiesaboutthe futureare potentiallytrue, and have evidence supportingorundermin-ingthem. Sometimes, particularstoriesbecome infectious. Inves-torsundertheirswayheargood newsand are deafto the bad—and spread the bullish bugto others. Thispushesup prices, bol-steringthe bulls. An ICOmaybe a consequential innovation, soearlyentrantswill make a mint. Butitmaybe thatregulators willpreventthem becomingmore than a curiosity(both China andSouth Korea have banned them). WorseningnewsforICOscouldmake pessimisticstoriesthe nextvirus.Cryptos through the tulipsViral optimism maybe especiallycommon in the winner-takes-all contestsso frequentwithin digital markets. Platform-basedﬁrms(which aim to provide a digital space within which otherenterprisescan do business) orsocial networksgrowmore valu-able astheygain users. People wantto be where everyone else is.In such cases, one ofmanycontenderseventuallydominates,and those with a stake in itssuccess, whethersharesor tokens,reap vastrewards. Butbecause investorslackperfectforesight, thelevelsatwhich marketsvalue nearlyall contendingﬁrms will, inhindsight, appearto have been obviouslybubbly. In the sameway, the value ofthe winningﬁrm, which looked laughably highduringthe bubble, will laterlookreasonable. One ortwo oftheICOs—and cryptocurrenciesthemselves—stand to followsuch apath, iftheycome into wide use. Thinka crypto version ofGoo-gle (and pitythose holdingtokensforcrypto-AltaVista).Burstsofinvestorenthusiasm sometimes(ifnotalways) spurexperimentation and investment, layinga foundation for futuregrowth. Caution isneeded, however. Marketsare notperfectly ef-ﬁcient. Buttheyare usuallyeﬃcientenough to punish those whomistake a beton one version ofthe future fora sure thing. 7Manias, panics and ICOs Crypto-coin mania illustrates the crazyand not-so-crazysides ofbubblesFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchangeThe EconomistOctober7th2017751NOBELweek, a round oflecturesandceremoniesheld everyDecemberinStockholm, which climaxeswith theaward ofthe prizesthemselvesand a sub-sequentbanquet, isa leisurelyaﬀair. Sinceprizewinnerscome from all overtheworld, thatisa good thing. Itgives themtime to recoverfrom theirjetlagbeforetheymeetthe KingofSweden, and themedalsand chequesare handed over. Thisyear, three ofthe prizewinnersmaypartic-ularlyappreciate that, fortheyare some ofthe scientistswho have helped explainwhyjetlagexistsin the ﬁrstplace. JeﬀreyHall, Michael Rosbash and Mi-chael Youngare, between them, responsi-ble forworkingouthowthe endogenousclocksoffruitﬂies—and, byextension, ofotherorganisms—run whatisknown asthe circadian rhythm. Thisisthe internalcycle (circaisthe Latin for“about” and diesthe Latin for“day”) thatmatchesthebody’sphysiologyto the alternation oflightand darknesscaused byEarth’srota-tion. Itcontrols, amongotherthings, sleeppatterns. Hence the discovery, once jet en-ginesmade rapid travel acrosstime zonespossible, thatsomeone ﬂyingfrom, say,London to NewYork, will take several daysto adjustto NewYorksolartime.DrHall and DrRosbash worked atBran-deisUniversity, in Massachusetts. DrYoungoperated separately, atRockefellerUniversity, in NewYork. Theirﬁrststep, in1984, wasto isolate a fruit-ﬂygene calledperiod, which had previouslybeen foundto help control circadian rhythms. At athan halfofthose awarded forphysicssince 1985 have been given forworkdonemore than two decadesbeforehand. Thisyear’s, though, wasdiﬀerent. Itwent toRainerWeissofthe MassachusettsInsti-tute ofTechnology, and BarryBarish andKip Thorne ofthe California Institute ofTechnology, all ofwhom were involved inthe detection, justtwo yearsago, of gravita-tional waves. Such wavesare one ofthe manypredic-tionsofAlbertEinstein’scentury-old the-oryofrelativity. AsEinstein realised, gravi-tyisa resultofmassdistortingthe spaceand time around itself. Thatdistortionmodiﬁesthe pathsofobjectsmovingnear-by. Crunch the equationswhich describethisprocess, and theysuggestthatmovingmassesshould create rippleswhich radiateoutinto the universe.Spottingsuch susurrationsrequiressensitive machines. All three laureatesworked on an American gravitational-wave detectorcalled LIGO, which wascompleted in 2002. LIGOworksbysplit-tinga laserbeam in two and sendingthedaughterbeamsup and down a pairoftunnels, each 4km long, which are setatrightanglesto each other. Anypassinggravitational wave should stretch andcompressthe two armsin diﬀerentways,causinginﬁnitesimal changesin the time ittakesthe laserbeamsto traverse them. Inorderto conﬁrm thatitreallyisseeing agravitational wave the machine hastwosuch pairsoftunnels—one in Washingtonstate and the otherin Louisiana. Agravita-time when gene sequencingwasin itsin-fancy, thiswasremarkable enough. Dr Halland DrRosbash then wenton to measurethe concentration in ﬂybrainsofthe pro-tein thisgene encodes. Theydiscoveredthatthe protein’sconcentration cyclesupand down overthe course of24 hours,peakingatnight. Theyalso measured lev-elsofthe messengermolecule producedbyperiodgenes, which carriesthe recipeforthe protein to a cell’sprotein-makingmachinery. That, too, cyclesdaily—peakingafewhoursbefore the protein does. The crucial partofthe storyisthat theprotein itselfinhibitsthe action of periodgenes. The more ofitthere is, the less activethe genesare. Thatreducesproduction ofthe messengermolecule, which reducesproduction ofthe protein, which permitsthe gene to reactivate. And so on. Lotsofothergenesand proteinsare in-volved aswell—manyofwhich were alsodiscovered byDrHall, DrRosbash and DrYoung. Some ofthese serve to linktheclockto information from the eyes, permit-tingitto stayin synchronywith the sun.Butitisthe underlyingcycle ofperiodgeneactivity, regulated bythe messengermole-cule and the protein, thatisthe actual pen-dulum ofthe biological clock.AmatterofgreatgravityThe physicsprizewinnersbroke recordsabouttime in a diﬀerentway.

Despite itssensitivity, LIGO’sinitial runcame up empty-handed. Itwasonlyafter aseriesofupgrades, startingin 2010, thatitbecame sensitive enough to detectthewavesﬁnallyand unambiguously. Theﬁrst—prizewinning—spot, in 2015 isreck-oned to have been the consequence oftwoblackholescolliding1.3bn lightyearsfromEarth. Since then, more discoverieshavebeen made. Afewdaysbefore the Nobelaward, LIGOannounced the detection ofitsfourth gravitational wave. And more de-tectorsare comingonline. The fourth de-tection wasaided bya European instru-ment, VIRGO, based in Italy. Otherdevicesare underconstruction in India and Japan.Aspace-based system called LISA, with“arms” millionsofkilometreslong(and, asaresult, much highersensitivity) is sched-uled forlaunch in the 2030s. Butthisyear’sphysicsprize honoursmore than justanotherconﬁrmation ofEinstein’scleverness. Up until now, astron-omershave had to relyon the electromag-neticspectrum—from radio waves,through visible light, to gamma radia-tion—to gaze atthe universe. The detectordesigned and builtbyDrWeiss, DrBarish,DrThorne and several hundred othersci-entistsoﬀersa newwindowon the world,and could help astronomerssee things,like black-hole collisionsorthe state oftheuniverse shortlyafterthe BigBang, thatelectromagnetism cannot. Into the freezerThe chemistryprize wentto JacquesDubo-chetofLausanne University, in Switzer-land, Joachim FrankofColumbia Universi-ty, in NewYork, and Richard Henderson ofthe LaboratoryforMolecularBiology, inCambridge, Britain. Each contributed tothe developmentofcryoelectron micros-copy, a technique thatpermitsthe shapesofbiological molecules, such asproteins,to be seen withoutmanyofthe diﬃcultiesinvolved in preparingthem foroldertech-niques, such asX-raycrystallographyorconventional electron microscopy.DrDubochetinvented a wayoffreezingsamplesthathasproved crucial to the tech-nique. Asample—say, a protein ofinter-est—issuspended in waterand drippedonto a thin metal mesh. Thismesh isthenplunged into liquid ethane, ata tempera-ture ofaround -180°C. The speed ofplung-ingiscrucial. Do ittoo slowlyand the wa-terin the sample will turn into ice crystalsthatdestroythe protein molecules. If donefastenough, though, the waterturnsnot toice, butinto a glassystate thatpreserves theproteinsforstudy.DrHenderson turned to thistechniquewhen a protein he wastryingto prepare forX-raycrystallographywould notcrystal-lise, and could not, therefore, be examined.In 1990, aftermore than 15 yearsofeﬀort, hebecame the ﬁrstto use itto produce a pic-ture ofa protein, bacteriorhodopsin, thatwasasdetailed asX-raycrystallographycan provide. DrFrank’scontribution wasmathemat-ical. He developed a method fordeducingthe three-dimensional structuresofpro-teinsfrom the ﬂatsnapshotsthata cryo-electron microscope produces. The up-shot, afteryearsofreﬁnement, isa newand betterwayofexaminingbiologicalmolecules. Since itisoften the shapes ofthose moleculesthatdetermine theirfunc-tion, ﬁndingoutexactlywhatthe shapesare iscrucial forresearchers. Forinstance, itallowsdrugsto be designed deliberately tointeractwith moleculesratherthan simplyguessingwhatchemicalsmightactasdrugsand screeningthem bythe million.Whethercryoelectron microscopyreal-lycountsaschemistrymightbe debated.Physicistswould have a case forclaiming itforthemselves. Butwhereverittruly ﬁtswithin the taxonomyofscience, itis, inmore waysthan one, a cool invention.7The virtue of uprightnessAtten-shun!OFFICE desksatwhich youstand areall the rage. Abundantevidencesuggeststhatsittingdown forlong peri-odsisbad forhealth, and thatworkingstandingup isthusbetterforyou. Butisitbetterforthe job? Apiece ofresearch justpublished in Psychological SciencebyYanivMama ofAriel University, in Israel,and hiscolleagues, suggestsitmight be.Standingtakesmore eﬀortthan sittingdoes, and mighttherefore be expected torequire more mental attention. The mus-clesinvolved have to be monitored andﬁne-tuned constantlybythe brain. Psy-chological experimentssuggestthatattention isa ﬁnite resource. Standingmightthusbe expected to reduce theamountofitavailable to be given else-where. Acounter-hypothesis, though, isthatstandingcreatesmild stress—andexperimentshave also shown that, whenpeople are understress, theircognitiveperformance improves.To distinguish between the two, DrMama putsome volunteersthroughwhatisknown asthe Stroop testwhiletheywere standingorsitting. The Strooptestrequiresparticipants(in this case 50universitystudents) to state the printedcolourofwordsthatare themselves thenamesofcolours. In some cases, themeaningofthe word and the colourinwhich itisprinted are the same. In others,theyare diﬀerent(eg, the word “blue”printed in yellowink). Decadesofexperi-ence have shown thatittakesa volunteerlongerto state the colourofthe ink whenitisdiﬀerentfrom the meaningof theword than itdoeswhen theyare identi-cal, and thatthe gap can be increased stillfurtherbyimposingothermental de-mandsatthe same time.The upshotwasthatthose who werestandingwhen theytookthe testdidsigniﬁcantlybetteratitthan those whowere sitting. The gap between the twoscoresofthe standingvolunteerswasabout100 milliseconds. Between thosesitting, itwasabout120 milliseconds.

Re-searchersfrom diﬀerentcountriesfre-quentlycollaborate with each other, a pro-cessmade evereasierbythe rise ofelectroniccommunications. Sometimes,theyactuallychange countryto do so. Ma-rie Curie moved from Poland to France.Guglielmo Marconi moved from ItalytoBritain. Nikola Tesla moved from Austria-Hungaryto America.Those are famoushistorical examples,butthese dayssuch migration iscommon-place. Presumably, all the gaddingaboutleadsto betterresearch. Butscientists donotlike to workon presumption, so twostudiespublished in Naturethisweekhavetested the idea. Both conclude thatyes, itprobablydoes.CassidySugimoto ofIndiana Universi-ty, in Bloomington, and hercolleagueslooked atpaperslisted in “Web ofScience”,adatabase thattrackshowoften an articleiscited byanother. Theyrestricted theiranalysisto studiespublished between2008 (the ﬁrstyearforwhich the databaseheld complete listingsofa paper’sauthorsand theirinstitutional aﬃliations) and2015. Thatnarrowed the ﬁeld to around14m papers, on one ormore ofwhich some16m diﬀerentresearchershad been listedasan author. DrSugimoto classiﬁed re-searcherswhose countryofaﬃliation re-mained unchanged duringthe periodstudied as“non-mobile”. Thiswastrue of96% ofthem. The remaining4%, who hadchanged countryatleastonce, DrSugi-moto classed as“mobile”. She then looked atthe numberofcita-tionseach scholar’spublished papershadreceived. More inﬂuential workwould beexpected to garnermore citations. Thus re-searchers’ citation recordsare commonlyregarded asproxymeasurementsforthequalityofthe science theyproduce. Sheand hercolleaguesfound that, whatevertheircountryoforigin, mobile researchersproduced more highlycited worksthandid theirnon-mobile peers. The boost in ci-tationsranged from 10.8% forNorth Ameri-can scholarsup to 172.8% forscientistsfromeastern Europe.DrSugimoto’sanalysisdoesnot, admit-tedly, showwhetherhigh citation isa resultofmovingcountryormerelya conse-quence ofonlythe brightestand best mak-ingsuch moves. Butthe second paper, byCaroline WagnerofOhio State University,in Columbus, and Koen JonkersoftheEuropean Commission’sJointResearchCentre, in Brussels, suggeststhatthese peri-pateticindividualscertainlydo beneﬁt thecountriesthathostthem.DrWagnerand DrJonkersused regres-sion analysis, a statistical technique, tolookforcorrelationsbetween a country’sspendingon research and development(R&D), the ﬂowofscientistsin and outofit,and the qualityofthe science produced byitsresearchers(asindicated bythe numberofcitationstheyreceived). The pair discov-ered thatplaceswith large numbersof sci-entistscomingand goingdid indeed pro-duce papersthatwere more highlycited(see chart). Theyfound no such relation-ship between a country’sR&Dspendingand itsscientiﬁcimpact. High-spendingcountriesproduced more papers, butpro-portionatelyno more ofthe highlycitedonesthan countrieswhich spentless.One notable outlier, the United States,wasranked highlyforscientiﬁcimpact bythe analysis, despite scoringpoorlyonopenness. But, compared with the otherson the list, the United Statesisboth hugeand hasa large home-grown scientiﬁcworkforce thatismobile between thememberstatesofthe union. The bestanalogyto thisthatDrWagnerand DrJonkerscould come up with wasthe European Union. Thishasmore peoplethan the United States(510m comparedwith 320m), also permitsunfettered travelbetween itsmembersand, like the Ameri-can federal government, hasresearch pro-grammesthatprovide cash forscientistsfrom diﬀerentinstitutionsto collaborate.Accordingto DrWagnerand DrJonkers, EUscientistspublished around 40% ofthe toptenth ofthe world’smost-cited papersin2014, while America produced around35%.

Itisa well-studiedspecies, and amongthe factsthathaveemerged aboutitisthatindividual birdsdo, indeed, have distinctpersonalities. Inparticular, some are measurablybolderand more tolerantofpotential threats,such asnearbyhuman beings, than others. The team’sresearch area wasthe Bo-tanicGarden in Dunedin, the citywherethe universityisbased. Thisisopen to thepublic, butsome areasare more frequent-ed byvisitorsthan others. Dunnockshavesmall territories, so itwaspossible to mea-sure the amountofhuman disturbance inagiven territorywith reasonable preci-sion. And, byringingeach ofthe dunnocksin the garden with colour-coded bands itwaspossible to identifyindividualsbysight. Altogether, the researcherslooked at99 ofthem.Theyworked outa bird’slevel ofthreattolerance bythe simple expedientofhav-ingone oftheirnumber(asfaraspossiblethe same person each time) walktowardsit, and then measuringhowclose that indi-vidual could getbefore the bird ﬂew away.Theydid thisseveral timesforeach bird ev-erybreedingseason, and repeated the pro-cessoverthe course ofthree seasons.Aparticularbird’sﬂightdistance (ie,howcloselyitcould be approached beforeitdeparted) was, theyfound, constantwithin a breedingseason. From season toseason mostbirdsgota little bolder—pre-sumablyastheylearntmore abouttheworld and whattheycould safelygetawaywith. Butthisincrease in boldnesswith agewassmall compared with the diﬀerentstartingpointsofbold and timid birdswhen theyﬁrstarrived in a territory. Itdidnot, therefore, much aﬀectthe factthat, onaverage, birds’ ﬂightdistanceswere in-verselycorrelated with the level ofhumandisturbance in theirterritories. This wasaconsequence ofdisturbed territoriesbeingsettled bybold birds, and undisturbed ter-ritoriesbyshyones.In the case ofdunnocks, then, naturewinsovernurture.

That, atleast,isthe conclusion reached byJoel Thorntonofthe UniversityofWashington, in Seattle,and hiscolleaguesin a paperjustpub-lished in Geophysical Research Letters. Theydemonstrate thatlightningstrikesthe Indi-an Ocean and the South China Sea almosttwice asoften alongshippinglanesas itdoesotherareasofthese waters. DrThornton and histeam considered1.5bn strikesrecorded in thispartof theworld bythe World Wide LightningLoca-tion Network(an international collabora-tion led byDrThornton’scolleague, RobertHolzworth) between 2005 and 2016. Asthemap shows, those strikesthathappenedoverthe ocean were concentrated in placesmostplied byships. In particular, the ship-pinglane thatpassesfrom the south of SriLanka to the northern entrance oftheStraitsofMalacca, and thence down thestraitsto Singapore, positivelyglows withlightning. (Itswestward extension to theSuezcanal wasoutside the studyarea.)

Nordoesit seemplausible thatthe shipsthemselves(admit-tedlymade ofmetal, and also the talleststructureson whatisotherwise a ﬂat sur-face) are responsible forattractingall theextra strikesinvolved.

Youcould detect itin the objectsofeverydaylife: coins ofgold and silver, booksbound in leatherembossed with gold, stampsdoubling asworksofart. The middle classeslived insolid contentment, with enough space tobringup a familyand enough servants tolighten the domesticdrudgery. No won-derthe generation shattered bythe ﬁrstworld warand buﬀeted bythe Depres-sion, then bythe rise ofcommunism andfascism, looked backon the Edwardianera asan enchanted long-ago, whencivilised people were forevertaking teaon the vicarage lawn.

Iron, steel, cot-ton and steam enriched Britonsathome asglobalisation tookoﬀ.Bymid-centurytwo-ﬁfthsoftradedmanufactured goodswere produced in theUnited Kingdom. Aquarterofglobal tradeﬂowed through the country’sports. In 1851Britonshad an average income 65% higherthan the average German and 30% higherthan the average American. In 1900 Britaingoverned around a quarterofthe world’speople, with militaryspendingunder4%ofGDP. Prime ministersofthe era gavetheirnamesto Melbourne, Wellington,Palmerston North in NewZealand, PortStanleyin the Falklandsand Salisbury,nowHarare, Zimbabwe. Georgetown,Guyana and Victoria, Seychelleswerenamed afterthe century’smonarchs.Butto manysubjectsitdid notfeel soglorious. AsDavid Cannadine shrewdlyidentiﬁesin “VictoriousCentury”, hisvol-ume in the Penguin HistoryofBritain se-ries, economicturmoil often fuelled politi-cal discontent. The 1820s, 1830sand 1840swere marked bysevere slumps. Ludditesrioted againsttechnology, ordinarypeopleprotested forpolitical rightsunderthe ban-nerofChartism, and more than 1m Irishstarved in potato famines. Later, Britonsworried aboutthe newlyunited UnitedStatesand Germanyovertakingtheirecon-omy. Politiciansofthe 1880shad to dealwith Irish angeragainstlandlords, fuelledbya newand sometimesviolentnational-ism, and massstrikesbytrade unions, nolongerbanned.The century’smostsuccessful primeministers, both Tories, each won four elec-tions: Lord Liverpool wasin oﬃce from 1812to 1827 and Lord Salisburydiscontinuouslyfrom 1885 to 1902. Each had to deal with un-rest. Liverpool curbed civil freedoms,while Salisburyexpanded the empire andtried to rallyBritain forQueen Victoria’s1897 Diamond Jubilee.

The North wearied ofthe expense ofkeepingfederal troops inthe South, and the disputed election tochoose Grant’ssuccessor, in 1876, resultedin a deal to end Reconstruction. The Klanrose viciouslyagain. Would thingshavebeen diﬀerenthad Lincoln lived, his fullpresidencyfollowed directlybyeight yearsofGrant, withoutan interruption for theretrograde AndrewJohnson? Itisunknow-able. In a remarkablypithymemoir, writ-ten while he wasdying, Grantforecast this:“Astime passes, people, even ofthe South,will begin to wonderhowitwaspossiblethattheirancestorseverfoughtforor justi-ﬁed institutionswhich acknowledged therightofpropertyin man.” Imperfectthe18th presidentmayhave been, buthe wascertainlyfar-sighted. 7The EconomistOctober7th2017 Booksandarts8112DURINGthe 1960s, governmentswererespondingto political unrestand eco-nomicchallengeswith nationalisation,centralised planningand publicspending(ﬁnanced byheavytaxesand debt). Therewasintense pressure forSirJohn Cow-perthwaite, the ﬁnancial secretaryof HongKong, to join the crowd.Civil servantsin Whitehall had beenurgingtheircounterpartsin HongKong tointroduce high taxesforsome time. Localsdemanded spendingto addressa lackofhousingforcrowdsofpoorimmigrantsﬂeeingthe horrorsofpost-revolutionaryChina, and a territory-wide shortage ofdrinkable water. Meanwhile, the territo-ry’sexport-driven economywasthreat-ened byrisingglobal tariﬀs, prompting de-mandsforpublicincentivesto reorientproduction towardsthe domesticmarket.AnewbiographyofCowperthwaite byNeil Monnery, a formermanagementcon-sultant, tellsofa man who replied to thesedemandswith a qualiﬁed “no”, and in theprocessbecame thatmostunusual ofthings: a bureaucrathero to libertarians.Hisapproach would subsequentlybe la-belled “positive non-interventionism”,meaninggovernance stoppingjustshort oflaissez-faire. Publichousingwould befunded, butonlyfortinyﬂats; reservoirswould be built, butuserswould becharged. Much ofthe restwasleftto indi-vidualsand businessesto sortout, unfet-tered bygovernmentdirectives. “Money,”Cowperthwaite said, should be left“tofructifyin the pocketsoftaxpayers”.Cowperthwaite’sabilityto resist biggergovernmentwasborn in a lostera. He waseducated in classicsand economicsat atime when the insightsofAdam Smith pre-vailed. Thatgave him the foundation to de-bate with free-spendingcolleaguesinﬂu-enced byJohn Maynard Keynes. In 1945, he arrived in a HongKongin ru-insfrom a brutal Japanese occupation. Acombined military-colonial administra-tion engaged heavilyin economicmanage-ment, and Cowperthwaite’searlyjobsin-cluded managingthe trade in food and rawmaterialsand administeringprice con-trols, rolesthatdeﬁned a heavygovern-menthand. Buthe knewthatthe territory’slackofnatural resourcesmeantthatpost-crisisprosperitydepended on itsability toattractentrepreneursand capital.Thatmeantgovernment’srole wastoprovide freedom ratherthan help. Re-questsbyindustryforsubsidieswere rou-tinelyrejected. So too wasdeﬁcitgovern-mentﬁnancing, which could merelypushcoststo a future generation and make theterritoryvulnerable to ﬁnancial upheaval.Some ofhisideaswere radical: to ensurethattemporaryﬂuctuationsin businessconditionswere notused to justifygovern-mentcontrols, he banned the collection ofmacroeconomicstatistics. “We suﬀera greatdeal todayfrom theboguscertaintiesand precisionsofthepseudo-scienceswhich include all the so-cial sciencesincludingeconomics,” washisbluntappraisal. “I myselftend to mis-trustthe judgmentofanyone notinvolvedin the actual processofrisk-taking.” Thisfaith wasrewarded. Asindustriessuch ascotton spinning, enamelware and wigsde-clined and Cowperthwaite declined to of-ferassistance, businessesshifted their at-tention to promisingareassuch astoy andelectronicsproduction, and then ﬁnance.Migrantsfound workin the expandingin-dustries, becominga cogin a productiveengine ratherthan merelya cost.When Cowperthwaite stood down in1971histenure wasreckoned a huge suc-cess, butthatprovided onlylimited protec-tion forhispolicies. The embargo on datacollection wasreversed byhissuccessor.Subsequentadministrations, both Britishand Chinese, whittled awaythe restraintson governmentintervention. One persistentobjection to limited gov-ernmentparticularlyrankled Cowperth-waite—thatitwascallous. He wascon-vinced that“the rapid growth oftheeconomy…producesa rapid and substan-tial redistribution ofincome [and] makes itpossible to assistmore generouslythosewho are not, from misfortune temporaryorpermanent, sharingin the general ad-vance. The history[ofHongKong] demon-stratesthisconclusively.” Asthathistorybecomesincreasinglyremote, a biographyofa keyarchitectbecomesevermore valu-able.

Manyscholarsworkon the topicnonetheless,butfewoftheirﬁndingshave achievedconsensus.On one thing, atleast, mostagree:though animalscommunicate, onlyhu-manshave true language, with the powerto organise complexthoughtsinto a stringofwords, often aboutabsentorabstractthings. And mostscholarsalso reckonthatHomo sapiensisthe onlyspecies everto have had such language. Theythink itmusthave emerged somewhere between200,000 and 50,000 yearsago. NowDaniel Everett, ofBentleyUni-versityin Massachusetts, has, in “HowLanguage Began”, published a broadsideagainstthatidea. He thinksthatHomoerectus, Homo sapiens’spredecessor, hadsomethingthatcould be called language—and notjustgruntingproto-speech. Thiswould make language not200,000 yearsold, butsomethinglike 1.9m. Atissue ismore than chronology.Noam Chomskyhasproposed thatonehuman developed, through one geneticmutation, an abilitycalled “Merge”,about50,000 yearsago. “Merge” allowstwo linguisticunitsto be joined into a sin-gle one, such asa complexnoun phrase(the houseand the hill becomingthe houseon the hill) ora complexsentence (SallylovesLucybecomingpartofBill knowsthatSallylovesLucy). The mind can fur-thermerge and manipulate the newunitsto make even more complexones. This,called recursion, iswhatMrChomskycallsthe language faculty“narrowlyde-ﬁned”. Otherelements, like advances inauditoryprocessing, he thinks, are sharedwith animals, orare also used fornon-lin-guisticpurposes.MrEverettpublished, in 2005, an articleclaimingthatan Amazonian tribe he hadlived with foryears, the Pirahã, had no re-cursion. Thisled the pressto crown Mr Ev-erettasthe anti-Chomsky: MrChomskyhasspenthiscareeratMIT, focusingon the-ory. He iscausticand imperiouswith op-ponents. MrEverettlived in the jungle withhisfamilyand several diﬀerenttribes,learningtheirlanguages. He wentasa mis-sionary, onlyto renounce hisChristianity,quite publicly, lateron. MrChomskyis notknown forconcedingerror.MrEverettclaimsthatrecursion is nei-thernecessarynorsuﬃcientforhumanlanguage. Homo erectus, he thinks, proba-blyreallydid talksomethinglike “Me Tar-zan, youJane”—butwith thishe could doquite a lot. MrEverettproposesthat lan-guage required a seriesof“signs” ofad-vancingcomplexity. The ﬁrstisthe “index”,anon-arbitraryand non-intentional sign,like a hoofprintthatmakescleara horsehasbeen near. Nextcomesthe “icon”, anon-arbitrarybutintentional sign, such asadrawingofa hoofprintto represent ahorse. Homo erectusseemed to valuestonesresemblingthingslike a phallusand a fertile woman. Thisindicates ab-straction and “displacement”, where anobjectismade to representsomething notphysicallypresent.Then, MrEverettreckons, iconsdevel-oped into “symbols”—some ofthem spo-ken, arbitrarysoundsthat, unlike icons,had lostanyconnection to theirreferent(as“cat” soundsnothinglike a cat). Ges-ture and intonation would have been cru-cial to makingthese symbolsunderstoodand agreed upon. All the while, the brainand speech organswere evolvingto han-dle more and more complexutterances. When Homo erectusbegan usingsev-eral symbolsone afterthe otherin a morepredictable pattern (butnotyetrecur-sively), MrEverettthinkshe could be saidto be usinghuman language. The linguistpointsto circumstantial evidence: Homoerectuswould have needed itto build raftsorboatsand plan seaborne voyagestoreach placeslike Flores, an Indonesian is-land 24km from the nearestland, wheretoolsfrom thatera have been found.The intellectual and philosophicalstakesin the debate are high. Iflanguage isarecentgreatleap forward in Homo sapi-ens, thisimpliesthatall human languagesare fundamentallysimilar, while markingasharp breakbetween humansand otheranimals. Butiflanguage isan inventionrelyingon general-purpose partsof hu-mans’ brains, in interaction with local cul-ture overa million-plusyears, then hu-man languagesmaybe ratherdiﬀerentfrom each other, and more continuouswith the abilitiesofanimalsand distantancestors.

The next daythe newsdescribed anotherraid byagentsinvestigatingfraud on the project. Over thenextmonthshe looked on wrylyasthegrand vision wasslowlytrashed and keyﬁgureswere indicted. Comparingdemo-craticsystemswith authoritarian ones, hewonders“which ismore time-consuming:ourlengthyproceduresto arrive atdeci-sionsortheirlengthyproceduresto undothem.” Meanwhile he notesthatwhile Do-nald Trump the presidentrailed against in-eptgovernments, Donald Trump the prop-ertydeveloperplayed them expertlytowin permitsand subsidies: “Ifindeed thepublicsectorisdysfunctional then Trumpisthe monsteritcreated.” MrDe Graafcannotgive easyanswersto the tough questionsaboutarchitecture’spublicpurpose; there are none.

He gota biggerone when he said heanswered: “Mom, I was.” Hislistenerswere thinkingofthe missionaryposition,no doubt, and the hundredsofwomen hehad conquered with thatirresistible satur-nine charm. Buthe wasabsolutelyserious.Asthe man who broughtsexual liberationto America in the form ofclubs, casinos,BunnyGirlsand naked centrefolds, he toowasa preacherand a prophet. Butinsteadof“Thoushaltnot”, the creed ofPuritankilljoysdown the centuries, hiswas“Free-dom!”—and the loud tootingofa sports car,accessorised with beauties, drivingatspeed through America’sdrearilycon-formistsuburbsand itsherdsofsacredcows. Blessed isthe rebel, he cried; no pro-gresswithouthim.(AtthispointHefin hiswolﬁsh primewould pop anotherDexedrine, take a cou-ple ofpuﬀson hisever-presentpipe, spinround on hisgiantrevolvingbed and dic-tate the nextpara to hiseagersecretary. Hefin hisdotage would retie hissilkdressinggown, shuﬄe into hisvelvetslippers andgetone ofhisnubile assistantsto adjust hishearingaid, since too much Viagra—“thefountain ofyouth!”—had made him deaf.) Playboymagazine wasthe voice ofhisrebellion. He started itin 1953, with bor-rowed money, asa pleasure primerforyoungurban malesjustlike him. Itwasdedicated to the pursuitofhappiness andthe American dream: ifyouworked hard,youtoo could claim yourprize ofbig hi-ﬁrigs, ﬁne winesand bed-readygirls. Hepicked those himselfin seigneurial fash-ion; sometimes, in the photos, hispipewould be perched in an ashtraybesidethem. He liked hisPlaymatesto resemble aprettygirl nextdoor, to showthatnice girlsliked sextoo, in oroutofmarriage. Ifyoudoubted it, youonlyhad to read the Kinseyreportof1948, which had letthe sunshinein on the hyperactive sexlivesofthe citi-zenry. Whatwasthishypocritical hangupAmerica had, thisbugaboo of“sin”? Sexwasfun. Whetheritwasmorallygood orbad wasn’tthe point. The moralitydepended on the situation. All thatstuﬀaside, sexwasalso the beginningofcivili-sation, the life force. Itshould be celebrat-ed. YetAmerica had swarmed since itsfoundation with censors, prigs, prudes andbluenosesintenton sexual repression. Tokeep down a natural drive led to deviancyand crime, even witch-burnings, evenmassmadness(atleastashe understoodCotton Mather, orCatholicmedieval Eu-rope). And itwastyranny, pure and simple.Thiswashisphilosophy. He called itone, and laid itoutin longeditorials overmonthsand years. Thismeanthe had todefend itagainstloungingsneererslikeWilliam F. Buckley, who ﬂungwordslike“latitudinarianism” athim on TV. Well, hecould be an intellectual too, showing in themore literarypagesofPlayboy—with oﬀer-ingsfrom VladimirNabokov, RayBrad-bury, John Updike and JackKerouacandinterviewswith Orson Wellesand MartinLutherKing, amongmanyothers—thathewason the verycuttingedge ofculture. Black-satin corsetsWhatotherphilosophersreallydislikedwasthathe made moneyfrom it. Alot ofmoney. The ﬁrst-everrun ofPlayboy, withMarilyn Monroe clothed on the coverandinside naked, sold outovernight. Itwas thecoup ofa lifetime. By1958, proﬁtswere $4mayear. He branched outinto PlayboyEnter-prises: clubsand casinosacrossthe world,ﬁlms, cable, digital. Hisbunnylogo wasoncuﬄinksand shirts. The 1970swere hisbestyears, when he moved from Chicago to thePlayboyMansion in LosAngelesand ﬂewin a blackPlayboyjetwith attendants in ul-tra-briefblackleather. The 1980s, when helostgamblinglicencesin London and At-lanticCityand wasdogged byscandals,were rocky, and in 1988 he gave up controlofhisempire. Playboy’scirculation fell tolessthan 1m. Butbythen he wasso rich thathe could go on livinghisbigboy’sdream,wearinghiscaptain’shatin bed and parad-ingwith armfulsofgigglingconquestsclad, to hisorders, in “lingerie orless”. He backed civil rightsofmostsorts.Feminists, though, were the enemy. Theyseemed to wantwomen to be asexual,when the pointofhiscrusade wasto cele-brate theirwonderful diﬀerences: as dis-played bythose BunnyGirlswho staﬀedhisclubsand casinos, so cute in thoseblack-satin corsetsthatmade theirbreastsbigger, those bigearsand ﬂuﬀytails. (AllHef’sidea; he loved to have a menagerie athand.) Theywere free, too, to turn any clubmemberdown, exceptforNumberOnekeyholders. And he refused to run pornog-raphy, even in the 70swhen, duringthe“PubicWars”, Penthousedid. Shortofrealsmut, whycoverup such objectsofdesire?To manyhe wasa priapichorror, but tohimselfhe wasa romantic. Playboywasreallya boy-girl romance magazine. Theﬁrstpin-upshe fell forat14 were tastefuldrawingsofnudesfrom Esquire. He wasavirgin on hisﬁrstmarriage, and tried ittwice more, buthe liked variety. His careerwasa questforbeautyaswell asfreedom,he said, and Marilyn gloriouslytoppedand tailed it. He nevermether, orpaid herforthose photographs, buthe forked out$75,000 to getthe cryptin Woodlawn rightbeside hers. To spend eternitytogetherwasthe sweetestthought. And she, ofcourse, would feel the same. 7Livingthe dreamHugh Hefner, founderofthe Playboyempire, died on September27th, aged 91ObituaryHugh HefnerMore than just hot air?Kuala LumpurNovember 1st 2017More world leaders signed up in Paris in 2015 to an international agreement on climate change than had ever done so before.
