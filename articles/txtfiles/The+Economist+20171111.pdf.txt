Manypeople predictedthatAmerican foreign policywould take a disastrousturn. MrTrump had suggested thathewould scrap trade deals, ditchallies, puta ﬁgurative bomb un-derthe rules-based global orderand drop literal ones willy-nil-ly. NATOwas“obsolete”, he said; NAFTAwas“the worsttradedeal maybe ever”; and America wasfartoo nice to foreigners.“In the old dayswhen youwon a war, youwon a war. You keptthe country,” he opined, addinglaterthathe would “bomb theshitoutof” IslamicState (IS) and “take the oil”. So far, MrTrump’sforeign policyhasbeen lessawful thanhe promised. Granted, he haspulled America outofthe Parisaccord, makingitharderto curb climate change, and aban-doned the Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership, a bigtrade deal. However,he hasnotretreated pell-mell into isolationism. He has notquitNATO; indeed, some ofAmerica’seastern European alliespreferhistough-talkto the cool detachmentofBarack Obama.He hasnotstarted anywars. He hasstepped up America’sde-fence ofAfghanistan’sbeleaguered government, and helpedIraq recapture citiesfrom IS. In the partsofthe world to whichhe payslittle attention, such asAfrica, an understaﬀed versionofthe previousadministration’spolicycontinueson auto-pilot. AsMrTrump makesa 12-dayvisitto Asia, itishard to dis-misshim asa man whollydisengaged from the world. Manypeople ﬁnd reassurance in the sober, capable mili-tarymen who surround him (see page 20). Hischiefofstaﬀ, hisdefence secretaryand hisnational securityadviserall under-stand the horrorsofwarand will stop him from doing any-thingrash, the argumentgoes. Optimistseven speculate thathe mightemulate Ronald Reagan, byshakingup the dip-lomaticestablishment, restoringAmerica’smilitarymuscleand projectingsuch strength abroad thata frightened, over-stretched North Korea will crumble like the SovietUnion. Oth-ersconﬁdentlypredictthateven ifhe causesshort-term dam-age to America’sstandingin the world, MrTrump will bevoted outin 2020 and thingswill return to normal. Reagan, he ain’tAll thisiswishful thinking. On security, MrTrump has avoidedsome terrible mistakes. He hasnotstarted a needless rowwithChina overTaiwan’sambiguousstatus, ashe once threatenedto do. Congressand the election-hackingscandal preventedhim from pursuinga grand bargain with VladimirPutin thatmighthave leftRussia’sneighboursatthe Kremlin’smercy.And he hasapparentlycoaxed China to exerta little more pres-sure on North Korea to stop expandingitsnucleararsenal. However, he hasmade some seriouserrors, too, such asun-derminingthe deal with Iran thatcurbsitsabilityto make nuc-learbombs. And hisinstinctsare atrocious. He imagines hehasnothingto learn from history. He warmsto strongmen,such asMrPutin and Xi Jinping. Hislove ofgenerals ismatchedbya disdain fordiplomats—he hasgutted the State Depart-ment, losingbusloadsofexperienced ambassadors. His tweet-ingisno joke: he underminesand contradictshisoﬃcials with-outwarning, and makesrecklessthreatsagainstKim Jong Un,whose paranoia needsno stoking. Furthermore, MrTrumphasyetto be tested bya crisis. Level-headed generals mayad-vise him, buthe isthe commander-in-chief, with a tempera-mentthatalarmsfriend and foe alike. On trade, he remainswedded to a zero-sum viewoftheworld, in which exporters“win” and importers“lose”. (Are thebuyersofIvanka Trump-branded clothesand handbags,which are made in Asia, losers?) MrTrump hasmade clear thathe favoursbilateral dealsovermultilateral ones, because thatwaya bigcountrylike America can bullysmall onesinto mak-ingconcessions. The trouble with thisapproach istwofold.First, itisdeeplyunappealingto small countries, which bythewayalso have protectionistlobbiesto overcome. Second, itwould reproduce the insanelycomplicated mishmash ofrulesthatthe multilateral trade system wascreated to simplify andtrim. The Trump team probablywill notmake a bigpush to dis-ruptglobal trade until taxreform haspassed through Con-gress. Butwhen and ifthathappens, all betsare oﬀ—NAFTAisstill in grave peril.Ideas matterPerhapsthe greatestdamage thatMrTrump hasdone is toAmerican softpower. He openlyscornsthe notion that Ameri-ca should stand up foruniversal valuessuch asdemocracyand human rights. Notonlydoeshe admire dictators; he ex-plicitlypraisesthuggishness, such asthe massmurder ofcrimi-nal suspectsin the Philippines. He doesso notoutof dip-lomatictact, butapparentlyoutofconviction. Thisis new.PreviousAmerican presidentssupported despotsforreasonsofcold-warrealpolitik. (“He’sa bastard, buthe’sourbastard,”asHarryTruman isreputed to have said ofan anti-communisttyrantin Nicaragua.) MrTrump’sattitude seemsmore like:“He’sa bastard. Great!” ThisrepelsAmerica’sliberal allies, in Europe, East Asia andbeyond. Itemboldensautocratsto behave worse, asin SaudiArabia thisweek, where the crown prince’sdramaticpoliticalpurgesmetwith MrTrump’sblessing(see leaderon nextpage).ItmakesiteasierforChina to declare American-style democra-cypassé, and more temptingforothercountriesto copy Chi-na’sautocraticmodel (see page 27).The idea thatthingswill return to normal aftera singleTrump term istoo sanguine. The world ismovingon. Asiansare buildingnewtrade ties, often centred on China. Europeansare workingouthowto defend themselvesiftheycannot relyon Uncle Sam. And American politicsare turninginward: bothRepublicansand Democratsare more protectionistnowthantheywere before MrTrump’selectoral triumph. Forall itsﬂaws, America haslongbeen the greatest force forgood in the world, upholdingthe liberal orderand oﬀering anexample ofhowdemocracyworks. All thatisimperilled byapresidentwho believesthatstrongnationslookoutonly forthemselves. Byputting“America First”, he makesitweaker,and the world worse oﬀ.7EndangeredAmerican inﬂuence has dwindled underDonald Trump. Itwill notbe simple to restoreLeaders12LeadersThe EconomistNovember11th20171MARKETSand maniasgo to-gether. The latestfrenzy isforall thingscrypto. The price ofthe best-known digital currency,bitcoin, hasrisen bynearly700% thisyearand isnowabout$7,500; one enterprisingﬁrm re-centlyquadrupled itsshareprice simplybyaddingthe word “blockchain” to itsname. Butnowhere do alarm bellsringmore loudlythan in therealm of“initial coin oﬀerings” (ICOs), a form ofcrowdfundingin which ﬁrmsissue digital “coins” or“tokens” in return for apayment(typicallyin ether, anothercrypto-currency). ICOshave raked in more than $3.2bn thisyear, rivallingthe moneyﬂowingto internetstartupsfrom early-stage venture capital.Although mostofthese tokensare supposed to be used in ex-change forthe companies’ products, asin a corporate loyaltyscheme in the oﬄine world, investorsscentsomething diﬀer-ent: the chance to be in atthe birth ofanotherbitcoin. Itistemptingto dismissICOsasnothingbuta fraud’schar-ter. Theyare easyto pull oﬀ, requiringlittle more than a fewen-terprisingsoulsand an ambitious-soundingplan. Unlike eq-uity-owners, coinholdersgetno claim on an issuer’searnings.Projectsare beingmarketed to retail investors. In SeptemberAmerica’sSecuritiesand Exchange Commission (SEC)broughtitsﬁrstchargesagainsta token-issuer, for allegedlypromisingheftyreturnsfrom ﬁrmsthatbarelyexist. China andSouth Korea have banned ICOsaltogether. Yetthere isusuallymeaningin the madnessoftechnology-driven bubbles. The British railwaymania in the 1840shelpedcreate a national networkoftrain lines; the dotcom boomspawned ﬁrmssuch asAmazon and eBay. So itiswith ICOs.Theycan provide a source ofﬁnance forserioussoftwareprojectswhich otherwise have a hard time gettingoﬀ theground. Asan analogy, imagine thatin the earlydays ofthe in-ternetdomain nameshad been sold to ﬁnance the develop-mentofthe networkwith the promise thattheirvalue wouldrise asonline traﬃcgrew. ICOsmayalso give rise to newformsofﬁrm: because foun-ders, employeesand usershold coins, everyone hasan interestin seeingtheirnetworkgrow, asthiswill drive up the value ofthe token. One example ofthisisFilecoin, which in Septemberraised $257m and will allowtoken-holdersto buyand sell digi-tal storage on each other’scomputers. Enthusiastssaythatthese “crypto co-operatives” combine the advantagesofaﬁrm—lowertransaction costs, aggregation ofcapital—with adecentralised structure thatmeansno one controlsit orthedata itholds. Such hopesmayprove unfounded, butthere isachance thatorganisationsofthissortcould oﬀeran alternativeto the monolithictech giantsoftoday. The babyin the bathwaterForthese reasons, itiswrongforregulatorsto ban ICOs. Fortu-nately, mostare more thoughtful. Some, like the ﬁnancial-mar-ketauthoritiesin Quebec, have invited ICOsinto a regulatory“sandbox”, where lessstrictrulesapply(see page 59). The SEChasissued a useful reportgivingguidance aboutwhen a tokenisa security, meaningthatan ICOhasto complywith registra-tion requirements. Thismonth itwarned celebritiesagainstmakingendorsementsofan ICO(asFloyd Mayweather, a box-er, and ParisHilton, a socialite, have done).The bigtestofregulatorswill come when the ICObubblepops, asitsurelywill, and people lose money. Ifthe backlash issevere, ICOsand the organisationstheyﬁnance mightfall outoffavourforyearsto come. Alotoftoday’sICOssound silly,and some are scams; mostofthe projectstheyﬁnance will fail.Buttheymightjustcontain the seed ofa digital future thatisnotdominated bya fewonline giants. 7Initial coin oﬀeringsScam orsubstance?

Ahot-headed Arabian princeAll thisiswelcome. Butthe waythe prince isgoingabout en-actingchange isworrying. One reason isthathisambition toooften turnsto rashness. He led an Arab coalition into an un-winnable warin Yemen againstthe Houthis, a Shia militia, cre-atinga humanitarian disaster. He hasalso soughtto isolate Qa-tar, a gas-rich neighbour, succeedingonlyin wrecking the GulfCo-operation Council and pushingQatartowardsIran. Withfewerconstraints, he could become still more reckless. He israttlingthe sabre atIran overthe warin Yemen, and maybechallengingitin Lebanon. Duringa visitto Riyadh, the Saudi-backed Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, announced thathe would step down, and denounced interference byIran anditsclientmilitia, Hizbullah (see page 43). WhatpreciselytheSaudisintend to do in Lebanon isunclear. Butmanyworryabouta return to violence in a countryscarred bycivil warandconﬂictsbetween Hizbullah and Israel. Anotherconcern isthe economy. Prince Muhammad’splanfortransformation reliesin parton luringforeign investors. Buttheywill be reluctantto commitmuch moneywhen someonelike Alwaleed bin Talal, a prince and global investor, can be ar-rested on the crown prince’ssay-so (see page 42). LastmonthPrince Muhammad made a pitch to foreign investorsfor a newhigh-tech cityﬁlled with robots, NEOM. The glitzyeventtookplace in the same hotel complexthatisnowa prison.Athird cause fordisquietisthe stabilityofthe monarchy.Saudi rule hashitherto rested on three pillars: consensus and abalance ofpoweracrossthe sprawlingroyal family; the bless-ingofWahhabi clerics; and a cradle-to-grave system of bene-ﬁtsforcitizens. Prince Muhammad isweakeningall three byconcentratingpowerin hisown hands, pushingforsocial free-doms, and imposingausterityand privatisation. Much ofthishad to change. He could seeknewlegitimacybymovingtowardsgreaterdebate and consultation. Instead,space fordissentisdisappearingand executionsare rising. Theanti-corruption campaign isbeingcarried outwith little ornodue processto determine who isguiltyofwhat. Manyordin-arySaudisare cheeringfornow. Butthe arrestslook like XiJinping’spurgesin China, notthe rule oflaw. Ashemeetsresis-tance and hisbasenarrows, the crown prince mayrelyincreas-inglyon the securityapparatusto silence critics. That wouldonlyrepeatthe mistakesofrepublican Arab strongmen: social-lyquite liberal, butrepressive and ultimatelya failure. Manyhave predicted the fall ofthe House ofSaud, only tobe proved wrong. The mostlikelyalternative to itsrule, ﬂawedasitis, isnotdemocracybutchaos. The countrywould frag-mentand, in the scramble foritsriches, Iran would extend itspower, jihadistswould gain a newlease oflife and foreignpowerswould feel compelled to intervene. The world mustferventlyhope thatPrince Muhammad’sgood reformssucceed, while urgingrestrainton hisbad im-pulses. PresidentDonald Trump iswrongto cheerthe purgeon. The Westshould instead counsel the prince to act with cau-tion, avoid escalation with Iranand free political life athome.Prince Muhammad maybe heedingthe dictum ofNiccolò Ma-chiavelli thatitisbetterfora prince to be feared than loved. Butthisadvice comeswith a rider: heshould notbe hated. 716LeadersThe EconomistNovember11th20172taxesbylessthan the House bill would.

The durabilityofthis ur-ban legend istelling, however.Washington grandeesand foreign gov-ernmentshave invested extraordinaryhopesin the men thatMrTrump likestocall “mygenerals”.

Atothertimes, senior de-fence folkchafe atMrTrump’sdistinctlyun-Reaganish scorn forAmerican excep-tionalism and apparentbeliefthathe haslittle ornothingto learn from predecessors.MrPanetta, a formerCIA directoraswell asdefence secretary, White Housechiefofstaﬀand congressman, worriesthatgeneralslackmuch experience of thehorse-tradingside ofpolitics. Watching hisformeraide, MrKelly, underﬁre after tak-ingto the airwavesto defend MrTrump,MrPanetta oﬀersthe thoughtthat: “Ifyou’re a good chiefofstaﬀ, one fundamen-tal role isto tell the president‘no’.”Forall the risksofa national-securityteam thatisso heavilyweighted towardsmilitaryexperience, MrPanetta believesthatMrTrump’sgeneralsare “the besthope we have to restrain thispresident andto keep him on a more traditional foreign-policypath”.

He remainsa fan ofMrKelly’sgrasp ofthe national interestandthe importance ofstrongborders, to thepointoftellingthe president, with whomhe speaksregularly, thatthe chiefof staﬀwould make a good secretaryofstate afterMrTillerson.He creditsMrMattiswith crafting aplan of“annihilation ratherthan attrition”againstthe extremistsofIslamicState, butadds: “Thatbeingsaid, I’m notquite surehe hastotallyboughtinto the Trumpianworldview, thatAmerica isnotgoingto un-derwrite the securityofthe whole post-warrules-based international order.” MrBannon urgesMrTrump to seekgen-eralswho share his“America First” vision.He hasurged MrTrump to studythe exam-ple ofAbraham Lincoln and hisgenerals.“Lincoln wassold on the factthatthe gen-eralswere experts, and had all the plans forwinningthe civil war. But[to win] he hadto ﬁnd Grantand Sherman, who were pre-pared to execute hisstrategy, which was toburn the South down.”Marching to a diﬀerenttuneSuch whiﬀsofrawpoliticsare justwhatworriesformercommanderslike AdmiralMike Mullen, chairman ofthe jointchiefsofstaﬀfrom 2007 to 2011.

MrPowell andAlexanderHaigboth served assecretary ofstate, while MrHaigwasa White Housechiefofstaﬀ.Thistime feelsdiﬀerent, saysMr Mul-len, both because there are so manygener-alsin high oﬃce, and because “the countrytakessuch comfortfrom them beingthere.”In hisexperience, militarycareersmay pre-pare generalsforthe political world, with asmall “p”—hearingson Capitol Hill ortalkswith foreign counterparts. Butthe world ofPoliticswith a capital “P” issomethingmore alien, and perilous. In a speech in Oc-tober, MrMullen questioned whetherit isrightto depend “on retired generalsfor thestabilityofourcitizenry”.Itisbetterto have good generals thanbad men in powerful jobs. Butno one cabi-netsecretaryoraide can save the govern-mentfrom calamity. The American chainofcommand allowsformuch robustde-bate.

Manyconcernedthingsthe Chinese would have done any-way. Still, MrTrump seemed pleased, as healso wasbyMrXi’s(reiterated) pledge toenforce UN resolutionson North Korea. The question ishowlongthe summit’sbonhomie will last. UnderMrXi, Chinahasbecome more open in itschallenge toAmerican inﬂuence in Asia. The oﬃcialmedia have turned more sharplycritical ofAmerica’spolitical system. The problemhashardlyreached the embassy-burningstage (angrycrowdslastsurrounded theAmerican embassyin Beijingin 1999, afterNATO’smistaken bombingofthe Chineseembassyin Belgrade). Butthere isa whiﬀChina were to collapse, America wouldnotbe the main reason). Ithasbeenviewed 3m timessince the startof2016.The phrase “American airisso sweet” hasbecome a term ofonline abuse.

The term isnowused assarcasticcriticism ofall thingsAmerican. Formanyyears, despite upsand downsin policy, China’srulersstuckto a strategicviewthatthe United Stateswasessentialto theircountry’smodernisation. China,theyargued, needed American technol-ogyto upgrade itsindustriesand Ameri-can marketsforitsexports. Thatview hasbecome farlessstronglyheld asChina’seconomyshiftsawayfrom exportsand to-wardshome-grown innovation. In the pastyear, moreover, ithasbeen overlain by acompetingidea: thatChina’sglobal ambi-tionsrequire a dose ofanti-Americanism.Bucking the normIn a speech lastmonth ata ﬁve-yearlypartycongress, MrXi made those ambi-tionseven more apparent. He talked ofmovingChina “closerto centre stage” andofthe country’s“all-round eﬀorts” to pur-sue “great-powerdiplomacywith Chinesecharacteristics”. Itisnotclearwhatthesecharacteristicsare, butitisa safe betthattheydo notinvolve acceptingglobalnormsestablished byAmerica.

Astudyin 2016 byZhangKun andZhangMingxin ofHuazhongUniversityofScience and Technologyfound thatAmeri-ca wasfardown the listofcountries aboutwhich the Chinese expressfavourableopinions—belowGermany, Britain, France,Canada, Australia and Russia. Thingsmayhave changed since then because views ofMrTrump are warmerin China than inmostplaces. ButopinionsofAmerica itselfare unlikelyto have improved much. A sur-veyin the same yearbythe PewResearchCentre in Washington also found thatonlyhalfofChinese respondentswere favour-able to America—much lessthan the globalmedian “favourabilityrating” forthe Un-ited Statesof64% then. American opinionsofChina are evencooler. Pew’spoll in 2017 found moreAmericansexpressed negative viewsaboutChina than positive. Such attitudesmightnotaﬀectpolicybuttheycouldmake publicdissatisfaction easyto ignite.Anecdotal evidence suggeststhere isplentyofﬂammable material.

Xinhua’sdescription ofdemocracy’sself-destructive tendenciesechoesthat ofabookpublished in 1991called “AmericaAgainstAmerica” bya professoratFudanUniversity, WangHuning. Butthere arethree importantdiﬀerencesbetween Chi-na’sinteraction with America todayandthe wayitwasthen. One isthatMrWanghasjustbeen elevated to the party’smostpowerful body, the Politburo StandingCommittee, where he islikelyto be incharge ofpropaganda (thatis, projectingthe party’simage athome and the coun-try’sabroad). Havingin such a position anAmerica-scepticwho actuallystudiedthere isunprecedented.Next, the governmenthasstarted to ex-portwhatitcalls“the China model”. DengXiaopingonce said China wasnota modelforanyone. Atlastmonth’spartygather-ing, MrXi talked aboutChina “blazinganewtrail forotherdevelopingcountries”and oﬀering“Chinese wisdom and a Chi-nese approach to solvingproblems” (his“Beltand Road Initiative” oﬀerslotsofcash, too). Orville Schell ofthe Asia Soci-etyin NewYorksaysthisseemsto set up aclash notjustofcivilisationsand values,butofpolitical and economicsystems. Third, the anti-American strain nowseemsto run from the top ofthe Chinesestate (MessrsXi and Wang) to the bottom(Xinhua and internettrolls). Thatsuggestssuch sentimentisgainingstrength. Mr Ximaystill preferto exercise caution in hiscountry’srivalrywith America.Buthedoesnotseem to have moderated hisglo-bal ambitionsbecause ofMrTrump. And itwill take more than a dinnerin the Forbid-den Cityto wish those ambitionsaway. 7ZHOUXIAOCHUANsometimessoundsmore like a zookeeperthan a ﬁnancialoﬃcial. China’scentral-bankgovernorhasrecentlyspoken ofa menagerie ofbeastsstalkingthe economy, from blackswans togreyrhinosand crocodiles. Chinese inves-torsknowwhateach refersto: swansareunforeseen risks; rhinosare neglected dan-gers; crocodilespreyon ﬁnancial weak-ness. And theyhave surelyall heard MrZhou’swarningsbynow. In the pastmonth he hascommented publiclyfourtimes, makingthe case thatdebtistoo highand that, withoutstricterregulation, Chinacould face trouble. Alwaysa straighttalker, MrZhou hasbeen blunterthan usual. To be sure, he in-siststhatthe economyisin good shape. Butata newsconference lastmonth on thesidelinesofa CommunistPartycongress,he spoke ofthe threatofa “Minskymo-ment”—a conceptnamed afterHymanMinsky, an American who postulated thatstable economiesend up crashingbecauseofoverconﬁdence thatbenign conditionswill prevail indeﬁnitely. In an article pub-lished on the central bank’swebsite on No-vember4th, MrZhousaid China had accu-mulated “hidden, complex, sudden,contagious” risks. So whyexpresssuchconcerns, and whynow? Economicanaly-sisprovidesonlypartofthe answer. Theagenda ofChina’spresident, Xi Jinping,and MrZhou’simpendingretirementfromthe central bank, the People’sBankofChi-na, are atleastasimportant. Itmayseem odd thatMrZhouissound-inggloomyjustwhen China appearsto bemakingprogressin patchingup itsﬁnan-cial vulnerabilities. The government’sde-clared economicpriorityfor2017 isto curbﬁnancial risk. In a “regulatorystorm”, oﬃ-cialshave reined in borrowingbyhighly le-veraged ﬁrmsand strengthened supervi-sion ofﬁnancial dealings. Partlyasa result, creditgrowth thisyearisatitsslowestin more than a decade.Nominal economicgrowth hasacceler-ated to a double-digitpace. China’sonce-soaringratio ofdebttoGDPisthusneartostabilising, atleastfornow(see chart). Thestructure ofdebtalso lookshealthier. As-setsheld bypoorlyregulated shadowlend-ers(everythingfrom trustcompaniestopeer-to-peerschemes) fell from 86.5% ofGDP atthe startof2017 to 82.6% atthe endofJune—the ﬁrstsizeable drop, calculatesMoody’s, a ratingsagency. Butthisbackdrop helpsto explain MrZhou’sstridency: hisrhetoricissensiblycountercyclical. When investorswere pes-simisticaboutChina’seconomyin 2016,MrZhoureassured them thatgrowth re-mained strong. With sentimentturningpositive thisyear, he isremindingevery-one thatthe workofdefusingpotentialproblemsisnotdone. Also, MrZhoucannotsimplydecide onhisown whatto focuson. Formally, thecentral bankanswersto the State Council.In practice, itreportsto the president. Atlastmonth’spartycongress, MrXi stressedthe importance ofpreventingmajorﬁnan-cial risk. He also refrained from stating eco-nomictargets, which used to be de rigueurin leaders’ speeches. LarryHuofMacquar-ie Capital saysthiscould herald tougherdeleveraging(in China, GDP targetstend tofosterrecklesslending). MrZhou’swordsecho the prioritiesofhismaster. Compared with otherswho enjoysimi-larstatusin China, MrZhouspeakswithunusual conﬁdence, in a mannerrefresh-inglyfree ofpartyjargon. Butdespite hisoutspokenness, he ishighlytrusted by theparty’sleadership. He hasbeen central-bankgovernorfor15 years, the onlyminis-terial-level oﬃcial to straddle three admin-istrations. He wasdue forretirement atthelastbiggovernmentreshuﬄe ﬁve years agobutwaskepton, a creditto hisrare combi-nation ofﬁnancial knowledge and politi-cal skills. Nowhisgovernorship isending.Almost70, he hasperhapsjustweeksbe-fore retirementand appearsto be trying toburnish hislegacy. Overall, he islikelyto be well remem-bered. Abroad, MrZhouisseen asa savvypolicymakerwho hastried to open thecountry’sﬁnancial system more widely toglobal marketforces, forexample bypush-inghisgovernment(albeitwith limitedsuccess) to permitfreertrade in China’scurrency, the yuan. Some analystsfault MrZhouforlettingcreditgrowth getout ofhand. Thatisunfair: itisthe party’sleaderswho ultimatelydictate monetarypolicy.With MrXi himselftalkingmore aboutrisk, MrZhouisseizingthe chance to am-plifythe message.

TheChinese pressclaimsthe South Korean side made bigconces-sions, including, allegedly, a promise notto undertake furtherTHAAD deployments, orjoin America and Japan in an anti-Chi-na alliance.

We will move forward to-gether.” Roughly230 milessouth-west,Ralph Northam, Virginia’sgovernor-elect,pictured above, sounded similarthemes(withoutthe leaping): “Virginia hastold usto end the divisiveness...and to end thepoliticsthathave torn thiscountryapart.”In one sense, these statementsare boiler-plate. Everynewlyelected politicianclaimsa mandate, and everyone saysthathe will serve and unite the electorate thathispredecessordivided and ignored.Buttheyare also rejectionsofDonaldTrump, and the divisive political style hechampions. MrTrump did notcampaignwith Kim Guadagno orEd Gillespie, the Re-publican gubernatorial candidatesin NewJerseyand Virginia. Buthe loomed none-theless. MrsGuadagno and MrGillespieran race-baitingadsthatspuriouslylinkedMessrsMurphyand Northam to violentundocumented immigrants, hopingthatTrumpism withoutthe increasinglyun-popularMrTrump could prove a path tovictory.

He vowed toworkwith MrTrump afterhavingcalledthe presidenta “narcissisticmaniac” lastsummer. He admitted to havingvoted forGeorge W. Bush twice. Some worried that apeeved base would stayhome.In the end, MrNortham won byninepoints, exceedingthe marginsofboth theoutgoinggovernor, TerryMcAuliﬀe, in 2013and HillaryClinton lastyear. Exitpolls sug-gestthatvoterswho decided on a candi-date in the campaign’sﬁnal weekbroke forhim, which helpsto explain the pollsters’misﬁre. MrNortham did bestin the state’smostpopulousareas: Richmond, Tidewat-erand the liberal Washington suburbs.And he won farmore votesthan MrMcAu-liﬀe did—532,689 compared with 373,413 inthe state’sﬁve mostpopulouscitiesandcounties—indicatingan unusuallymoti-vated Democraticelectorate.Finger-pointingfrom MrTrump’scampbegan immediately. Breitbart, the politicswebsite run byhisformerchiefstrategist,Stephen Bannon, called MrGillespie a “Re-publican swamp thing.” From Asia MrTrump tweeted thatMrGillespie lostbe-cause he “did notembrace me”.In fact, exitpollsshowed that34% ofVir-ginia voterscasta ballot“to expressoppo-sition to PresidentDonald Trump”; MrNortham won 97% ofthatgroup. Aplural-ityofvoters(39%) said health care wasthemotivatingissue; MrNortham won 77% ofthem. MrGillespie did bestamongvotersmotivated byimmigration. Buttheycom-prised just12% ofthe electorate. MrTrump’snativism hasa durable butsmallcore ofsupportin an increasinglydiverseVirginia. MrNortham had longcoat-tails: JustinFairfaxwill be Virginia’ssecond blacklieu-MrMurphy’swin wasthe more rou-tine. Aformerambassadorand GoldmanSachsexecutive who spent$20m ofhisown money, he broughtin the bigguns tostump with him: BarackObama and Joe Bi-den; CoryBooker, the state’scharismaticand ambitiousjuniorsenator; and perhapsbiggestofall in NewJersey, Jon Bon Jovi, a1980s-rockstarand native son.The lastround ofpollshad MrMurphyup by14 points; he won by13.

Since the startof2017, 112 Americanshave been killed inmassshootings, makingitthe worst yearin more than three decades.Asked aboutthe Texasshooting,Donald Trump said itwasnot“a gunssituation” and noted that“youwould’vehad hundredsmore dead” had an armedneighbournotshotthe gunman ashe leftthe church.

Jeﬀ Flake,aRepublican senator, hasintroduced abill which would preventthose convict-ed ofdomesticabuse in militarycourtsfrom acquiringguns. Itislikelyto gonowhere: even afterthe massacre of 20children in Newtown, Connecticut, in2012, the Senate rejected a bill to expandbackground checks.America’spowerful gun lobby, ofwhich the National Riﬂe Association(NRA) isthe mostprominentgroup, isable to cowRepublican legislatorsintoinaction.

Butin recentyearstheyhave become contentious, servingasprox-iesforthe rancorousdebate between advo-catesofeducation reform and teachers’unions. The reformerschampion increas-ingaccessto charterschoolsand expand-ingeducational optionsin general; the un-ionsoppose such an agenda on thegroundsthatitcould attractstudents awayfrom districtsthatbargain with teacherscollectively. (Charterschoolsreceive pub-licmoneybutare run independently, usu-allybynon-proﬁtorganisationsbutsome-timesbyprivate companies.) In the pastfewyearsoutside donorswith ideologicalorﬁnancial interestsin such ﬁghts have be-come involved, focusingattention andmoneyon previouslyignored local races. Chalkbeat, an education newsorgani-sation, reported thatpolitical committeeson both sidesofthe dispute channelled atleast$1.65m into the school-board racesthattookplace on November7th in Den-ver, nearbyAurora and DouglasCounty.Otherareashave seen even more expen-sive contests. In LosAngeles, where threeboard seatscame up forelection earlierthisyear, outside groupspoured nearly$15m into canvassingand advertisementson behalfofthe candidates. Much ofthemoneycame from California CharterSchoolsAssociation, which supportschar-terschoolsand received nearly$7m fromReed Hastings, the co-founderofNetﬂix, inthe run-up to the election, and UnitedTeachersLosAngeles, a union which op-posescharters. Accordingto Carol Burris,the executive directorofthe Network forPublicEducation, an advocacyorganisa-tion, outside moneyhasalso fuelledschool-board ﬁghtsin Louisiana, Minne-apolis, and Perth Amboy, a town ofjust52,500 in NewJersey. Itisnotjustthe volume ofcash beingpoured into school-board electionsthat isstriking. So iswhere itcomesfrom. As withpolitical contributionsin general, the ori-ginsofdonationsin school-board races arebeingobscured. The electionsin Coloradoillustrate how. Political action committees(PACs), which pool contributionsfrommembersand putthem towardscam-paigningfororagainstcandidates, are re-quired to disclose theirdonorrolls. Butso-cial-welfare organisations, also referred toas501(c)4safterthe section ofthe tax codethatdescribesthem, are not. Those whowish to fund local racesanonymouslycandirecttheirmoneyto amenable 501(c)4s,which in turn donate to the PACs. In Colo-rado, forinstance, a PACcalled RaisingCol-orado, which supportsthe campaignsofcharter-school champions, hasreceiveddonationsfrom onlyone source: Educa-tion Reform NowAdvocacy(ERNA), the501(c)4 arm ofa non-proﬁtorganisationwith itsheadquartersin NewYorkCityand Washington, DC. Who hasdonated toERNAisa mystery. Pedro Noguera ofthe Graduate SchoolofEducation and Information Studiesatthe UniversityofCalifornia, LosAngeles,attributesthe growingfocuson school-board racesto the perception—especiallyamongthe veryrich—thatAmerica’sschool system isa failure. American stu-dentsranksigniﬁcantlybelowtheirpeersfrom otherdeveloped countriesin science,mathematicsand reading. Federal testingdata suggestmathsproﬁciencyamongfourth- and eighth-gradersisdipping afteryearsofimprovement. Such discouragingnumbers, coupled with fearsabouthowartiﬁcial intelligence and othertechnologi-cal advanceswill up-end traditional meth-odsofeducation, have motivated somewealthybusinesspeople to throwmoneyateducational reform.Sometimestheyhave tried to do this di-rectly. In 2010, MarkZuckerberggave$100m to Newark’spublicschool system.Much ofthatwasused to launch newchar-terschools. LastyearMrHastingsestab-lished a $100m educational foundation.Othershave funnelled moneyinto thehandsoforganisationsand politicianswho share theirviews. In addition to MrHastings, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaireand formermayorofNewYorkCity, Ar-thurRock, a Silicon Valleyinvestor, andheirsto the Walmartfortune have all dedi-cated large sumsofmoneyto campaigningforcharterschools. The backersofthese schoolsinsist thatindependence producessuperioracadem-icresults. Criticsargue thatwhere charterschoolsdo better, thatisbecause they donotenroll the same typesofstudents, suchasthose who are learningEnglish asa sec-ond language orwho have disabilities, andthattheyshed theirmostdiﬃcultstudentsbackinto the publicsystem. Studiesofcharterschools’ performance bythe Cen-tre forResearch on Education Outcomes(CREDO) atStanford University haveturned up mixed results. Areportpub-lished in 2013 suggested thatpupilsatchar-tersprogressed bythe equivalentofonlyeightadditional daysoflearningper yearcompared with theirpeerswho are educat-ed atconventional publicschools. But fol-low-up research suggeststhatcharterschoolshave been much more successfulwhen educatingpoorchildren in cities. Furthercomplicatingmatters, a recentstudyin California found thatcharterschoolswith unionised teachersmaydobestofall, a resultthatisanathema to bothsides. Thatthe data are ambiguousmeansthatcharterschools’ advocatesand unionswill continue to scuﬄe forthe foreseeablefuture. School-board electionsare there-fore likelyto remain ﬁercelycontested.

Asproof, manycite the race-baitingcampaign Ed Gillespie, formerlya plain-vanilla Reaganite, ran inthe Virginia gubernatorial contest. Thatmanymoderate Republi-cansare ﬂeeingCongresslookslike anotherclue; announcing hisretirement, SenatorJeﬀFlake ofArizona said he could notfacemakingthe ideological and moral compromisesthatstumpingforthe partyofTrump entails. In a forthcomingbook, George W.Bush expressesa fearthathe will turn outto have been “the lastRepublican president”, so utterlyisMrTrump unmooringhispartyfrom itsconservative internationalistprinciples.Thisisto some degree understandable. America’spoliticalhistoryisreplete with outsiders, from Theodore Roosevelt to Jim-myCarter, who have tried to reorientate theirparties, much asMrTrump isnowdoing. He also hassome advantagesforthis task.Political partieshave neverbeen weaker, due to manyof the fac-tors, includingthe introduction ofthe primarysystem and rise ofgridlockin Congress, thathelped fuel MrTrump’sinsurgency. Re-publicansin Congressare twice asdespised asthe president; just13% ofAmericansapprove oftheirperformance. No wonderPaulRyan, Mitch McConnell and the resthave been slowto resist hisassaulton theirprinciples. And the factthatMrTrump hasa di-rectline to millionsoftheirvoterson Twitter—maybe the mostdisruptive feature ofhispresidency—makesthem additionallywary. Yetdramaticpartyrealignmentsare exceedinglyrare, andthere isso farlittle evidence thatMrTrump isexecuting one.In recenttime there have been onlytwo unambiguousexam-plesofthe phenomenon: Franklin Delano Roosevelt’sreorienta-tion ofthe Democratsin the 1930s, from a small-governmentpartyto the architectsofthe NewDeal, and Ronald Reagan’smeldingofsocial and small-governmentconservativeswith na-tional securityhawks, to form the Republican coalition thathasendured until now. These makeoversshared common features,which the Trumpian takeovermostlylacks. First, both leadersbuilton long-standingpolitical forces. The NewDeal coalitionwasfounded on the rise oftrade unionism and migration ofpoorblacksfrom the Republicans. Reagan’srevolution wasfuelled bygrowingconcernsaboutgovernmentexpansion, in partwhipped up byBarryGoldwater’searlierRepublican campaign.Second, though there were losersfrom both realignments—the small-governmentDemocratswho leftRoosevelt’scoalition,the RockefellerRepublicanswho leftReagan’s—theywere moreaboutsynthesis, rallyingthe party’sexistingconstituentsaroundanewendeavour, than aboutexclusion. Third, Roosevelt andReagan clinched theirargumentswith theirgoverningrecord.Reagan’sre-election campaign ad “Morningin America”, depict-inga moral societybusilyprospering, givesa powerful sense ofthat. “Thisafternoon 6,500 youngmen and women will be mar-ried and with inﬂation atlessthan halfofwhatitwas justfouryearsago theycan lookforward with conﬁdence to the future,” itsavuncularnarratorintoned.MrTrump’sinsurgencycontainsatmostone ofthose ingredi-ents, in the form oflong-standingunhappinessamongsomeworking-classRepublicanswith the liberal immigration andtrade policiesfavoured bythe party’selite. Thiswasalso evidentin the Tea Partymovement, which wasin partfuelled by anti-im-migration sentiment, and thusplayed Goldwaterto MrTrump’sReagan. Yetitishard to see Trumpism, asboth a populist eco-nomicplatform and oppositioniststyle ofpolitics, asan enduringRepublican response to thismalaise, farlessan eﬀective one.Unlike Roosevelt’sand Reagan’sprojects, itappearstoo reduc-tive to survive in a two-partysystem in which successdependson coalition-building. Though MrTrump, who hasneverwon amajorityin a national poll, haspandered to pro-business Repub-licans, hisprotectionism isanathema to them. Asishis nativismto the suburbaniteswho trounced MrGillespie. The presidentmayalso be too toxicto eﬀectthe transformation hiscritics fear.He hasundercutortainted mostpeople who have worked withhim—which mattersbecause Trumpism looksheavilydependenton MrTrump. Unlike Reagan, he hasno armyofpressure groupsto push hisagenda. He also haslittle governingsuccess to pointto. Indeed, itisnotclear—consideringhe isyetto make good onpopulistpromisesto pull outofNAFTA, boostinfrastructurespendingand rewrite immigration laws—thathe even thinks ofthem asa governingagenda. He hasﬁlled thatgap with ethno-nationalistdog-whistling; where he hastried turningthe whistlesinto action—asin hisattempted travel ban—he hasbeen checked.As dayfollows nightThisdoesnotmean MrTrump hasnotchanged hispartymorethan mainstream Republicanswere expecting. (There isindeed asense thattheyare overcompensatingforpastcomplacency.) Butinstead ofcapitulatingorquitting, theyshould reﬂecton the crisisthatﬁrstenabled hisinsurgency.MrTrump’stakeoverwasa resultofthe party’sweakness, nothisstrength. The Reaganite coalition hasfrayed asits constituentshave adopted extreme and contradictorypositions. Aparty thatwantsto slash social securityand union power, asMessrs Ryanand McConnell do, isnotforthe working-classvoterswho pro-vide halfofitsvotes. Apartythatburnstrillionsof dollarsonavoidable wars, asGeorge W. Bush did, isnotforsmaller govern-ment. In MrTrump’sstruggles, thoughtful Republicansshouldsee the promise ofa second chance to tryto reconcile these con-tradictions. Perhapsthe resultingsettlementwould retain tracesofMrTrump’spopulism. The class- and race-based grievances heisneedlingwill endure. Butthatwould be much lessthan theTrumpian submersion manyRepublicansfearisalreadyuponthem.

The leapfrog model

Technology in Afr ica is making huge advances, says Jonathan
Rosenthal. But its full beneﬁts will be reaped only once basics like
power supplies and communications are widely available

TO FLY NORTH from Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic
(CAR), is to look down on a country that has become hell. The dark shad-
ow cast by the UN helicopter passes over mile after empty mile of green,
fertile land. The few signs of former habitation—a homestead on top of a
hill, the remains of a once-ploughed ﬁeld—have been burned to the
ground or overrun by bush. After an endless succession of conﬂicts, al-
most all the people have ﬂed to refugee camps guarded by the UN.
There are many reasons why the CAR is in such a wretched state,
but high among them is that it is Africa’s most remote country, with al-
most no connections to the outside world. Even ideas struggle to cross its
borders. Fast internet and mobile-phone reception is available only in
and around Bangui. Its people are largely illiterate. It is, in short, a country
that technology has skipped over.
Yet the CAR is an exception.
Across the rest of sub-Saharan Af-
rica, countries are on the cusp of a
tech-driven transformation that
is already beginning to make peo-
ple healthier, wealthier and bet-
ter educated at a pace that only re-
cently seemed unimaginable. 
The ﬁrst taste of these new
possibilities came when mobile
phones swarmed across the con-
tinent a decade ago. Within just a
few short years hundreds of mil-
lions of people were able to
phone and text for the ﬁrst time,
bypassing monopolistic
state-
owned phone companies that
kept customers waiting for land-
lines indeﬁnitely. And leapfrog-
ging over old technologies and
business models with mobile
phones quickly made other sorts
of leaps possible. Thanks to M-
Pesa, a service that lets people send money through their phones, every-
one with a phone suddenly also had, in eﬀect, a bank account in their
pocket. As mobile money has lowered transaction costs, it has brought
down barriers to innovation in all sorts of other areas, allowing lenders
quickly to assess credit risks, insurers to sell life and medical cover in
small chunks and new energy ﬁrms to sell electricity by the day or week. 
Some of these innovations are emerging from the thriving tech
hubs that are popping up across Africa, but most of the technology trans-
forming the continent comes from elsewhere. The $50 smartphones on
which apps connect motorcycle taxis and customers in Rwanda are Chi-
nese, for instance. However, these technologies are often being com-
bined in new ways to solve uniquely African problems. If you want to
book a truck to move your cow, or get an ambulance to go to hospital, you
will probably turn to an African startup. 
For an example from the ﬁeld of medicine, take Dougbeh Chris
Nyan, born in Liberia and educated in Germany, who spent most of his
career in America, developing tests for infectious diseases. Since moving
back to Liberia after its Ebola epidemic in 2014-15, he has been working
with scientists both there and in America on a battery-powered device

that provides a quick and cheap test for six diﬀerent infections at
a time. It is fairly common in Africa (though rare in the rich
world) to see patients with multiple diseases such as malaria,
yellow fever and HIV. Mr Nyan’s machine “is an Africa-induced
innovation”, he says. “We are forced to be inventive to become
masters of our destitution.” 
Much of the money going into African technology comes
not from philanthropists but from hard-nosed investors looking
for attractive returns. In 2016 African tech ﬁrms raised a record
$367m. Although paltry by the standards of Silicon Valley, this is
helping to stimulate the setting up of ﬁrms such as Flutterwave, a
Nigerian payments company, and Zipline, which uses drones to
deliver blood to clinics in Rwanda. 
To be sure, the argument that Africa can catch up with the
West through technical wizardry has many critics. To begin with,
hundreds of millions of Africans are still without power or safe
drinking water, never mind phones or the internet (see map).
Corruption and misrule are widespread, and too many econo-
mies depend on commodity exports. In 2016 weak commodity
prices were partly responsible for a slowdown in economic
growth across sub-Saharan African to 1.4%, its most sluggish pace
in more than two decades. With the population growing by
about 3% a year, people on average got poorer last year.
Moreover, technology is advancing far more slowly in Afri-
ca than it is in the rich world, so the gap has been widening in re-
cent years. “The poverty gap is a technology gap,” says Kwabena
Frimpong Boateng, Ghana’s science and technology minister. It
is also a knowledge and education gap. Three-quarters of chil-
dren in their third year of schooling in Kenya, Uganda and Tanza-

nia are unable to explain the meaning of
the sentence “The name of the dog is Pup-
py” after reading it aloud. If the education
system cannot prepare youngsters for jobs
in a tech economy, Africa risks falling even
further behind. 
Yet a school in Mpigi, a town near
Kampala, Uganda’s capital, shows that
technology can also make teaching far
more eﬀective. A class full of children in
bright yellow uniforms chant in unison
after their teacher: “The letter q sounds
like kw, the letter s sounds like sss” as she
holds up ﬂashcards with letters on them.
The school, run by Bridge International
Academies, represents the biggest and
boldest eﬀort yet to improve teaching in
poor countries by putting technology in
teachers’ hands. 
Each teacher works from an electron-
ic tablet that has scripted lessons. This en-
ables the head teacher, as well as staﬀ at
Bridge, to follow the progress of each class.
It becomes instantly obvious if teachers
fall behind with their lessons or do not
show up for work. Last year Liberia hand-
ed over the management of 93 state
schools to various private operators, in-
cluding Bridge. A follow-up study showed
that children at the Bridge schools learned
about as much in one year as their peers in
the state system did in two.
Other ﬁrms are experimenting with
putting technology in the hands of stu-
dents rather than teachers. At the low end
of the cost scale is Eneza Education, a Ken-
yan ﬁrm that allows students to revise and take mock tests using
text messaging on basic mobile phones. At the other end are ini-
tiatives such as the Kio Kit, a set of rugged tablet computers that
can be used by children in the classroom.
Many of these initiatives are still embryonic, so data on
which ones work are scarce. But there are some encouraging
signs that even simple interventions can make a big diﬀerence. A
study of adult education in 160 villages in Niger by Jenny Aker of
Tufts University and Christopher Ksoll of the University of Ot-
tawa looked at whether weekly phone calls from researchers to
teachers and their students would improve the quality of learn-
ing. Remarkably, those calls seemed to result in much higher
grades for the students.

Tech-fr iendly

This is not just a top-down process in which people with
technology force it upon others. Given an opportunity to grasp
that technology, many in Africa do so with both hands. In a tech
hub in Lagos, Nigeria, enthusiastic youngsters tap away on lap-
top computers, practising coding skills that many have picked up
through online portals such as Udacity or by watching YouTube
videos. Jean-Claude Bastos, who sponsors an annual innovation
prize in Africa as well as a tech hub in the slums of Luanda, Ango-
la, recalls how alarmed he was when he ﬁrst put a 3D printer into
the centre, only to ﬁnd that the youngsters there immediately dis-
mantled it. “They took it apart, then put it back together, then did
it again. Now if anything in it breaks they rebuild it on intuition,
like it is a motorbike or car,” he says. 
In that spirit, this report will argue that a cluster of new

technologies promise to have a huge impact on Africa, not least
because they can help solve some of Africa’s biggest and longest-
standing problems. These include weak state-run education sys-
tems, a high burden of disease, broken infrastructure and low
productivity on farms and in factories. What made mobile
phones so much more important in Africa than in the rich world
was that for hundreds of millions of people they were the ﬁrst
and only form of telecommunication available. Equally, if a vac-
cine is developed for malaria, it will make little diﬀerence in the
rich world but could save millions of lives in Africa. “Invest-
ments in health R&D for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and other dis-
eases will be a massive boon for poor countries where the dis-
ease burden is highest,” says Bill Gates, whose foundation funds
some of this research. “The same is true for innovations like bet-
ter seeds that enable poor farmers to increase crop yields.”
What will all this technology add up to, and will it be
enough to help Africa close its gigantic income gap with the rich
world? The ﬁrst thing that needs to happen is for the continent’s
people to gain broad access to the most basic technological build-
ing blocks: electricity, phones and internet connections. “You
cannot have a 21st-century economy without power and connec-
tivity,” says Erik Hersman, a founder of several startups in Kenya.
“But if you have those, you can do almost anything else.” 7

Energy

Good night, gloom

Afr ica might leapfrog straight to cheap renewable
electr icity and minigr ids

WHEN SATELLITES TRAIN their cameras onto Africa at
night, it is almost as if they are peering back to an age before
electricity. The rich world is awash with great glowing orbs for
the main population centres and orange tentacles for the roads
that link them. But apart from speckles of light around the biggest
cities, much of Africa is dark. 
Of all the measures of the continent’s poverty, few are
starker than that about two-thirds of its people have no access to
reliable electricity. The Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ex-
perts led by Koﬁ Annan, a former UN secretary-general, puts the
number of Africans without any power at 620m, most of them in
villages and on farms. The panel found that in nine African coun-
tries fewer than one in ﬁve primary schools had lights. A study
by the World Health Organisation found that about a quarter of
clinics and hospitals in 11 African countries have no power of any
kind, and many of the rest get it from generators that often break
down or run out of fuel. 
Such power shortages cost lives. In Nigeria each year an es-
timated 36,000 women die during pregnancy or childbirth,
many because they deliver their babies in the dark in clinics such
as the one in Makoko, a slum perched on stilts above a lagoon in
Lagos, Nigeria’s biggest commercial city. It has just a few rough
wooden beds in a small room with a doorway so low that peo-
ple have to stoop to enter it. Straightforward deliveries are done
by candle and torchlight, says one local resident, a ﬁsherman. If
anything goes wrong, the mother is carefully passed down to a
small ﬁshing canoe and taken to a bigger hospital across the la-
goon. By then it is sometimes too late. Without power even the
simplest health precautions can become diﬃcult. “If you don’t
have electricity you don’t have a fridge, and if you don’t have a

fridge you can’t store vaccines,” says Jasper Westerink, who runs
the African business of Philips, a Dutch multinational ﬁrm.
Businesses across the continent have to contend with fre-
quent blackouts, known as dumsor in Ghana, from the Asante
words for “oﬀ and on”. They rely on expensive backup genera-
tors, so the electricity they use is among the costliest in the world.
The full impact of intermittent and high-cost energy on Africa’s
economy and society is hard to measure, but it seems safe to say
that this is the biggest single barrier to development. 
The World Bank reckons that if they had continuous energy
supplies, sub-Saharan Africa’s economies could be growing by
two percentage points a year faster, on average, than they do
now. A more limited study looking at the impact of blackouts on
small ﬁrms in Ghana found that power shortages sometimes al-
most halved their revenues, and in aggregate cost the economy
about 2% of GDP. Putting this right will require a huge investment
in generating capacity. But thanks to a happy combination of in-
novation and falling costs for renewable energy, Africa may now
be able to leapfrog ahead not once but twice, skipping both pol-
luting fossil fuels and, often, the electricity grid itself. 
Last year Africa added a record 4,400MW of renewable-
power capacity, roughly enough to meet Nigeria’s current con-
sumption, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
This is partly due to falling costs: the price of solar panels has
come down by more than 80% since 2010, and that of wind tur-
bines is also dropping fast. A recent study led by Anton Eberhard
of the University of Cape Town found that grid-connected wind
and solar renewable energy in South Africa is now among the
world’s cheapest.
But the dash for renewables also has to do with geography.
One of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy in Africa
is hydropower as Africa dams its biggest rivers, including the
Blue Nile, across which Ethiopia is building the Grand Renais-
sance Dam. When it is ﬁnished in a few years’ time it will more
than quadruple the country’s electricity-generating capacity,
from about 2,200MW to 8,700MW. The Congo river, for its part,
has the potential for the world’s largest hydropower station, with
a theoretical output of about 40,000MW, where it plunges down
a set of rapids between Kinshasa, the capital, and the sea. If it
were ever built, it would generate about 20 times more power
than the Hoover Dam in America, enough to light up South Afri-
ca, the continent’s most industrialised country.
Yet generating power is useful only if it can be sent to where

it is needed, and in many parts of Africa electricity grids seldom
stretch beyond big cities. Adding a house to the grid even in a
compact country such as Rwanda typically costs about $2,000,
which is more than the country’s average annual income per per-
son. The APP reckons that expanding grid power across Africa to
reach almost everyone would cost $63bn a year until 2030, com-
pared with the $8bn a year that is being spent now. 

Solar gain

Another set of innovations is oﬀering to sidestep this pro-
blem with mini rooftop solar installations that can power a
home, or slightly larger “micro-grids” that can light up a village.
Rooftop solar systems usually consist of a small solar panel and a
small rechargeable battery and controller which typically pow-
ers four lights, a radio and a phone charger. Most systems have a
built-in connection to the mobile-phone network that allows the
provider to switch it on or oﬀ remotely. Instead of shelling out
$250 or so upfront for an entire system, customers can buy elec-
tricity for the equivalent of 50 cents a day using mobile money. If
they run out of cash, their power is cut oﬀ until they are in funds
again. Thanks to this new “paygo” model, venture capital is pour-
ing into an industry that now has at least half a dozen signiﬁcant
ﬁrms. The largest of them, M-Kopa, has electriﬁed more than
500,000 homes and is adding almost 200,000 more a year.
Across the industry as a whole perhaps a million families now
have rooftop power. At current rates of expansion, the total may
double every 18 months or so. 
Prices for these systems are also falling fast. The Global Oﬀ-
grid Lighting Association reckons that prices of small solar-pow-
ered lights fell by 80% between 2010 and 2015. It forecasts that
those for a large home system, including low-powered lights,
television and radio, will fall by 45% between now and 2020.
The electrifying growth of rooftop solar energy is now
sparking another round of innovation, some of which may in
time travel back to the rich world. Azuri Technologies, a com-
pany based in Cambridge, England, is programming its systems
to forecast how much power each household will use that eve-
ning. It then subtly adjusts the brightness of lights or the televi-
sion to reduce power consumption on cloudy days. 
The main problem with rooftop solar systems is that they
produce only small amounts of power. They enable clinics to
keep functioning at night and to keep vaccines cool, and small
shops to stay open longer and oﬀer chilled drinks. But they can-
not run power-intensive machines such as welders or mills,
which require much larger solar installations and bigger batter-

ies. Still, in the past few years a growing number of energy-inten-
sive businesses such as mines have been putting up solar panels
to replace diesel generators. The IEA reckons that this can cut a
ﬁrm’s energy costs by half.
These bigger systems are also beginning to play a role in
powering villages with “minigrids”, which are much cheaper
and easier to install than full-scale national power grids. Data on
the spread of minigrids and their economic impact in Africa are
scarce, but a study by the Rockefeller Foundation in India found
that when minigrids were installed in villages, small businesses
increased their sales by 13% and incomes rose across the area. “If
you want to drive the productive use of electricity and move
people up the economic ladder, then you need a minigrid,” says
Deepali Khanna of the Rockefeller Foundation. The Smart Vil-
lages Initiative, which has brought together scientists from Cam-
bridge and Oxford Universities to get minigrids adopted more
widely in poor countries, found that once smallholder farmers
have electricity, they quickly adopt a range of other technologies
such as irrigation pumps and smartphones to get long-term
weather forecasts. “You then soon ﬁnd support industries spring-
ing up to feed this higher level of economic activity in the vil-
lages, together with a general increase in well-being,” says John
Holmes, a co-leader of the initiative. 
Minigrids have been relatively slow to take oﬀ because of
their high capital costs, but several organisations are trying new
business models to spread the expense. The Rockefeller Founda-
tion is exploring whether mobile-phone companies can become
anchor customers of minigrids. That would help to secure the ﬁ-
nance needed to build the grid, but also to reduce one of mobile-
phone companies’ biggest expenses: diesel for the generators
that power their masts. By one estimate this accounts for as much
as 60% of the cost of operating their networks in Africa. Minigrids
can thus help to spread not just energy but, just as important,
phone and internet connectivity. 7

Connectivity

The right connections

Beeﬁng up mobile-phone and internet penetration

WITH ITS SNAZZY technology hubs and army of bright
young programmers, Kenya can rightly claim to be east Afri-
ca’s tech startup nation. It was here that mobile money ﬁrst took
oﬀ, and it is here that oﬀ-grid solar power is making its biggest im-
pact. Even the election in August was meant to be a showpiece of
tech wizardry, with voting stations automatically beaming the
results via mobile internet to a computer in the capital, Nairobi,
to prevent tampering. But it turned out that about a quarter of the
country’s 41,000 polling stations did not have mobile-phone re-
ception and sent in incomplete results, leading to allegations of
vote-rigging. That helped persuade the courts to order a re-run. 
Most other countries are far worse placed. On average, not
even one in two people in Africa has a mobile phone, and many
have to walk for miles to get a signal. The economic costs of this
low penetration are enormous: every 10% increase in mobile-
phone penetration in poor countries speeds up GDP growth per
person by 0.8-1.2 percentage points a year. And when people get
mobile internet, the rate of growth bumps up again.
Apart from being useful in their own right, mobile phones

enable a range of other innovations such as mobile money that
improve lives and speed economic growth. A study in Kenya by
Tavneet Suri of MIT and Billy Jack of Georgetown University
found that M-Pesa, the mobile-payments system, alone lifted al-
most 200,000 families (about 2% of Kenyan households) out of
poverty between 2008 and 2014. 
If phones are powerful tools for alleviating poverty, broad-
band internet is even more potent. Jonas Hjort, of Columbia Uni-
versity and the International Growth Centre in London, and Jo-
nas Poulsen, of Uppsala University, looked at African economies
before and after they got connected, between 2006 and 2014, to
the big undersea internet cables that now cocoon the continent.
They found that connection caused a huge jump in employment
in areas that were able to access fast internet as companies set up
websites or used e-mail to sell their goods abroad. Not only were
people much more likely to have jobs, those jobs were more like-
ly to be good ones. The study also found that once countries got
fast internet connections, the number of new startups rose and
companies increased their exports. “I’m a ﬁrm believer in the hy-
pothesis that some of these transformative technologies can
help Africa leapfrog,” says Mr Hjort. One example of how this
also works for entrepreneurs is found in Nairobi’s slums, where
the arrival of fast internet connections led to the emergence of a
cottage industry selling video-editing services abroad.

Broadening out

For all the good the internet can do, its reach in Africa is still
limited. In some poor countries, such as Niger, Burundi and
South Sudan, less than 5% of people have access to mobile inter-
net. Across the continent as a whole only a quarter of Africans
can get the internet on their phones, according to the GSMA. Even
fewer have access to fast broadband delivered by cable; the Inter-
national Telecommunications Union (ITU) says that under one
in 100 people in Africa has cable internet, compared with about a
quarter in rich countries. Those who do mostly live in big cities
such as Johannesburg, Lagos or Nairobi. And even there the in-
ternet is expensive, partly because the data have to travel thou-
sands of kilometres through cables under the sea. TeleGeogra-
phy, a research ﬁrm, reckons that the wholesale cost of internet
connectivity in Johannesburg is about $9 a month for each mega-
bit per second of capacity, about 20 times as much as in London
and about ten times as much as in Los Angeles, even after big falls
over the past few years (see chart).
When these fat cables are connected to mobile-phone tow-
ers and the data beamed out, the costs rise yet again. The ITU cal-
culates that in poor countries the average cost in 2016 of the
smallest mobile-internet package was equal to 14% of the average
national income per person, putting it out of most people’s reach.

That forces users to buy their internet access in small chunks,
sometimes for as little as ﬁve cents at a time, which they then
hoard, turning on their phones’ data connection to send mes-
sages and then oﬀ again. “People use the internet in ways that we
would not recognise in the West,” says Andy Halsall, chief exec-
utive of poa!, a Kenyan startup oﬀering cheap internet access.
“Here you wouldn’t click on an advert or update an app because
it will use up your day’s allowance of data.”
Three complementary developments promise to help
spread aﬀordable phone and internet connections to all but the
most remote villages. The ﬁrst is a huge increase in the capacity
of the undersea internet cables connecting Africa to the rest of
the world. Since 2015 the total bandwidth available has more
than doubled and next year it will increase again as several new
cables come ashore. The eﬀects of competition on prices are al-
ready being felt. The cost of a connection between Johannesburg
and London is now less than one-ﬁfth of what it was in 2014, ac-
cording to TeleGeography. In other African countries prices have
dropped even more, says Nic Rudnick, the chief executive of Li-
quid Telecom, Africa’s biggest broadband internet company.
“You can now take a megabit of data from London or Paris and
deliver it to Lagos for about $2,” he says. “Just a few years ago that
would have cost you $600.” 
That still leaves the problem of getting fast internet from the
backbone out to homes and oﬃces. Much of this last-mile con-
nectivity relies on mobile-phone networks, but crowded and ex-
pensive radio waves are keeping the costs of mobile internet
high. “Fibre-optic cable makes up the arteries of the internet, but
wireless is the capillaries,” says Steve Song at the Network Start-
up Resource Centre. “But there is this massive bottleneck be-
cause regulators are struggling to make spectrum available.”
This provides an opportunity for a new breed of startups
that are disrupting mobile-phone and cable internet companies
by oﬀering Wi-Fi internet access. Wi-Fi signals can carry a lot
more data per second than those used by 3G or 4G phones. And
Wi-Fi equipment is cheap because it is mass-produced by many
competing ﬁrms. Radio transmitters able to beam Wi-Fi signals
over a distance of up to 50km cost less than $1,000, compared
with hundreds of thousands of dollars for those used by mobile-
phone ﬁrms. And unlike the spectrum used by mobile phones,
which is usually auctioned oﬀ and then taxed, the radio waves
that carry Wi-Fi are free. That allows ﬁrms such as poa! to sell in-
ternet packages with unlimited downloads in Kenya’s slums for
as little as 50 cents per day. Other ﬁrms, such as BRCK, which also
builds its own rugged wireless networking equipment, hope to
push costs low enough to provide connections without charging
the consumer, relying on advertisers instead. 
Cheap mobile-phone calls and internet access, in turn, will
pave the way for innovation in all sorts of areas, from farming to
health care to manufacturing. Start with agriculture. 7

Agr iculture

Yes, we have no
bananas 

How technology can cure market failures

WITH EMERALD-GREEN tea plantations stretching out as
far as the eye can see, the town of Nandi Hills has its for-
tunes planted ﬁrmly in the rich, red soil of Kenya’s highlands. In
the cool of a dark market, women traders surrounded by beans,
mangos and bananas wait for custom. Bananas seem an uncom-
plicated crop, but Pauline, a middle-aged tea farmer who also
grows fruit and vegetables, says she used to ﬁnd it hard to know
when to harvest and send them to market. They stay fresh on the
tree for weeks, but ripen quickly once harvested. If she and sever-
al other farmers tried to sell them on the same day, there would
be a glut and she would not even recover the cost of taking them
on the half-hour journey. “Sometimes I would just bring them
back to the farm and feed them to the animals,” she says. Yet on

other days there might be no bananas available to buy at all.
This market failure, leaving both farmers and customers
unhappy, is caused almost entirely by poor communications. It is
also easily solved. 2KUZE, a simple e-commerce system devised
by MasterCard with funding from the Gates Foundation, is now
linking up thousands of farmers and traders in a virtual market-
place, using text messages on basic mobile phones. A trader
might type in a request for honey that goes out to all the beekeep-
ers in the area. Those with honey to sell will respond. A middle-
man who aggregates many such orders will then collect it, pay-
ing the farmer on the spot using mobile money, before delivering
it to the market.
Such simple technologies might not seem to amount to
much in rich countries, but in many parts of Africa they can
make a big diﬀerence, improving farmers’ incomes as well as cut-
ting prices for consumers. They can also have a huge impact on
farm productivity and crop yields, which in Africa have been
largely stagnant for decades even as they have soared elsewhere.
Farming accounts for about a third of sub-Saharan Africa’s econ-
omy and employs more than half its adults. Most farms are tiny
and methods are much the same as they have always been, not
least because teaching millions of small farmers about modern
agronomy and animal husbandry is cumbersome and expen-
sive. Yet even a little knowledge can go a
long way. On a hillside about an hour
north of Nairobi, David Twara points to
his coﬀee bushes and explains how sim-
ple changes to the way he farms, such as
carefully applying fertiliser from a plastic
bottle top and pruning back old stems,
has increased his output by about 50%. 
Mobile phones and computers can
play a big role in spreading this knowl-
edge. A number of large agricultural ﬁrms
such as Olam, one of the world’s biggest
buyers of cocoa beans, are trying out ways
of using mobile phones and text mes-
sages to connect with tens of thousands
of small farmers. Olam has mapped the
location of each of its smallholder cocoa
suppliers, using smartphones, which en-
ables it to share information on market
prices and farming techniques. Wefarm, a
company based in Britain, has established
a social network for farmers that lets them
exchange information by text message. It
already has more than a quarter of a mil-
lion members in Kenya and Uganda. 

Have you done your weeding?

Such initiatives can make a big dif-
ference. A study in Kenya by researchers
from Harvard and Stanford universities
found that farmers who were sent text
messages with simple advice such as “re-
member to weed this week” increased
their yields of sugar cane by 11%. As sen-
sors become cheaper and internet con-
nectivity spreads, smallholder peasants
in many parts of Africa will be able to
gather data on soil and weather condi-
tions and get tailored farming advice from
intelligent computer systems. They can
also upload pictures of pests from their
mobile phones for identiﬁcation. And in-

FOR EACH OF the past three years South
Afr ica has lost more than 1,000 rhinos to
poachers, despite intensive eﬀor ts to protect
them using armed rangers, drones and
specially trained tracker dogs. Guarding
rhinos is par ticularly diﬃcult because they
roam across vast areas of veld where poach-
ers can hide easily. But two novel approaches
using ar tiﬁcial intelligence may help rangers
catch their hunters. The ﬁrst was developed
by a group of computer scientists who had
previously used ar tiﬁcial intelligence to
detect roadside bombers in Iraq and in-

Collared

surgents in Afghanistan. In South Afr ica
they used machine learning to predict where
rhinos were most likely to be feeding the
following day. The computers also crunched
histor ical data on poaching incidents to
identify areas where they were likely to
happen. Rangers and drones could then be
sent to patrol in areas most likely to have
both poachers and rhinos, says V.S. Subrah-
manian, who worked on the project at the
University of Maryland.
Scientists from IBM used a diﬀerent
approach to protect rhinos in the Welgevon-
den game reserve near Johannesburg in
South Afr ica, using radio collars and a data
network. The collars they have developed
can beam back the position and the speed at
which the animals wear ing them are moving.
Instead of attaching these to the rhinos,
they are collar ing other animals such as
impala or zebra that normally move along-
side rhinos. The data being sent back are
constantly monitored by computers for
speciﬁc patterns of movement. If a natural
predator gets into a herd of zebras, they will
scatter. But if a man with a gun approaches,
the animals will all star t to move in the
opposite direction, providing the rangers
with an early warning of intruders. So in-
stead of relying on just a dozen rangers to
keep an eye on things, the park beneﬁts from
hundreds of four-legged sentinels, each one
connected to a computer in the cloud.

already making their mark in
combination with mobile ﬁ-

insurance 
for
their crops and animals. If its
automatic weather monitors in
the ﬁeld detect a drought, farm-
ers receive a payout through
their phones without having to

also helping protect rhinos and
other
endangered animals
from poachers (see box on the
previous page). 
There are still big gains to
be had from planting better
seeds. Ethiopia’s government, for instance, has doubled the yield
of crops such as chickpeas and lentils by investing in crop re-
search. But one of the most useful recent innovations is surpris-
ingly low-tech. Trials conducted by Britain’s aid department and
the Gates Foundation have found that rugged triple-layer plastic
bags for storing harvested crops are remarkably eﬀective in re-
ducing losses from pests, which often eat as much as a quarter of
what has been gathered. Use of the airtight bags, which cost
around $2 each and hold about 100kg, boosted farmers’ incomes
by as much as 50%. Multiply improvements like this by 51m—the
number of farms in Africa—and the numbers quickly add up. 7

Health care

Doing more with less

Technology can make scarce medical resources go
further

AT THE END of a long row of benches where young moth-
ers wearily try to soothe their squirming babies is a clue to
both the enormous challenge involved in reducing infant mor-
tality in Africa and the huge potential for doing so. Perched on
the edge of an examination table in the only clinic oﬀering care
in a community north of Nairobi is a small silver-coloured horn
that looks a bit like a trumpet. Known as a Pinard horn, it is used
to check the heartbeat of a baby in the womb. In the rich world
the device, invented in 1895, was long ago replaced by doppler ul-
trasound machines, which do a much better job. Yet in many
parts of Africa it remains in widespread use because it is cheap
and does not need electrical power.
It is partly for want of better equipment that some of the
world’s highest rates of infant mortality are found in African
countries. The continent accounts for about two-thirds of all
deaths relating to pregnancy and childbirth around the globe,
even though it makes up only one-sixth of the world’s popula-
tion. And one infant in nine dies before their ﬁfth birthday, many
for lack of simple diagnostic tools. But that may be changing. An
innovation hub in Nairobi set up by Philips, a Dutch electronics
ﬁrm, has developed a wind-up portable doppler ultrasound
machine that needs no power and provides a digital readout of a
fetus’s heartbeat. A trial that pitted wind-up ultrasound moni-
tors against Pinard horns in Uganda found that the digital ver-

T E C H N O L O G Y I N A F R I C A

sion identiﬁed 60% more cases urgently needing treatment. 
Another innovation from the same hub is a chest monitor
that straps onto a baby and measures its rate of breathing to help
diagnose pneumonia. The company plans to package both de-
vices into custom-made backpacks kitted out with a solar panel,
a rechargeable light and battery-powered phone charger for use
by midwives and community health workers. This kind of
equipment is part of a plan to reshape primary health care in Af-
rica, using technology for cheaply diagnosing illnesses and mak-
ing better use of the limited numbers of doctors and nurses. 

Talk therapy

Babylon Health, a British startup that raised $60m to pro-
vide health advice in the rich world via a smartphone app, set up
an operation in Rwanda about a year ago. It now has more than
600,000 Rwandan clients, who pay less than a dollar for each
telephone consultation with a doctor assisted by a computer.
Artiﬁcial intelligence is also helping to solve more complex
problems. IBM has research centres in Nairobi and Johannesburg
where it is turning computers loose on issues such as how drug-
resistant TB spreads through communities and understanding
how genes that oﬀer protection against malaria contribute to an
increased risk of certain cancers. 
Robots, too, are making an appearance in health care. Of
the 7m people infected with HIV in South Africa, which is suﬀer-
ing the world’s largest epidemic of the disease, only about half
are currently being treated. The long queues of patients lining up
at the Helen Joseph hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa’s
busiest HIV clinic, show just how desperate the need is. The dis-
ease is already pushing South Africa’s public health system to
breaking-point. 
Epidemiologists hope to bring HIV under control by dou-
bling the number of people getting treatment. But the health sys-
tem cannot aﬀord to double the number of doctors, nurses and
pharmacists it employs, so it is turning to technology, including
robots. At the Helen Joseph, which sees 750 patients a day, a ro-
bot pharmacist is already at work helping to pick out drugs and
wrap them up for patients. Humans still check its work and hand
over the drugs, but waiting times in the clinic have come down
from more than four hours to less than 20 minutes. Researchers
are now working on ATM-style dispensaries that will be able to
provide patients with medication even faster.
Mobile phones can also play a role. Amref Health Africa, a
not-for-proﬁt group, is working on a mobile-phone app that can
be used to train community midwives and health workers. Mé-
decins Sans Frontières, a medical charity, is experimenting with
smartphone cameras to diagnose malaria, and researchers in
Australia are working on a
smartphone app that can tell
whether a patient’s cough indi-
cates asthma or pneumonia. 
Africa’s shortage of pro-
fessionals such as doctors and
pharmacists is forcing it to ex-
periment with technology, says
Solomon Assefa, the head of
IBM’s research eﬀort in Africa.
Rich countries are not yet un-
der the same pressure, but age-
ing populations and a rising
burden of chronic diseases are
already stretching their bud-
gets. The lessons learned in Af-
rica may soon come in useful in
the West, too. 7

Technology may help compensate for Afr ica’s lack of
manufactur ing

ALONG A WINDING road down the edge of an airport
near Pretoria, South Africa’s capital, is an aeronautical ver-
sion of a Mad Max world. An old UN cargo plane rusts in a ﬁeld.
Jammed up against fences are aeroplanes of various vintages
and states of disassembly. “Airheads” (aviation enthusiasts)
scrounge for parts to get their machines aloft again. 
Just around the corner is one of the most modern aircraft as-
sembly plants anywhere in the world. In it stand two brand new
prototypes of the Advanced High Performance Reconnaissance
Light Aircraft, or AHRLAC, designed to ﬁll a gap in the market for
a rugged aeroplane jam-packed with sensors that can patrol bor-
ders, look for poachers and drop guided weapons on insurgents. 
This is not the ﬁrst military aircraft designed in South Afri-
ca. During apartheid the country circumvented an arms embar-
go by building its own attack helicopters. But these planes are a
private venture aimed at a niche in the export market. The ﬁrm
that makes them, AHRLAC Holdings, has had some early suc-
cesses. On the production line a wing that will be mounted on

the ﬁrst aircraft for export is taking shape. The factory is prepar-
ing to churn out between two and four planes a month, though it
will not say who has ordered them, or in what quantities.
Signiﬁcantly, these planes were designed and built in an en-
tirely novel way using the latest computers, which reduced the
time it took to develop them from decades to just a few years. The
digital design is so precise that its robot-made parts ﬁt together
like a child’s Meccano set, making assembly quick and cheap. “It
is easier designing something new with a completely clean sheet
of paper,” says Andries Uys, a metallurgist working on the plane.
Legacy aircraft ﬁrms such as Boeing would “have to change 50
years of procedures and practices” to adopt such techniques.
The new plane is more than just a business venture for its
backers, which include Paramount Group, Africa’s biggest de-
fence ﬁrm. It started as a project to preserve engineering skills
and reverse a brain drain of young local aerospace graduates
who were leaving to work abroad, says Ivor Ichikowitz, Para-
mount’s founder. But it has morphed into a multimillion-dollar
venture that is spurring the development of other technologies
across South Africa. One taking shape in a nearby government
laboratory is the world’s largest 3D printer, which can print air-
craft parts from powdered titanium. 
In many parts of the world advanced robotics and 3D print-
ers are seen as a threat to manufacturing jobs. Yet in most of Afri-
ca manufacturing has never taken oﬀ, contributing just 5% of the
continent’s jobs, compared with 15-18% in other developing re-
gions, so robots will not kill many jobs. Instead, they oﬀer the op-
portunity to create new ones by helping African ﬁrms overcome

The shar ing economy, Afr ican style

IN HOTEL BARS in many par ts of Afr ica,
foreign businessmen like to regale each other
with tales about the diﬃculty of arranging
even simple things like accommodation or a
safe r ide from the airpor t. The head of a big
Amer ican investment bank recalls how he
bagged the last available room in a swanky
Lagos hotel, only for the door to fall oﬀ as he
entered. When he complained, the reception-
ist said, “No problem” and sent up two burly
guards to stand in the doorway all night. Your
correspondent’s contr ibution to this fund of
stor ies is about the disturbed night he spent
in a brothel af ter unwittingly booking into a
hotel with a reassur ingly international
franchise in its name.
Nowadays such mishaps are becoming
rarer, thanks largely to the shar ing economy.
A business traveller can hail a car from the
airpor t using a smar tphone app and travel
directly to an apar tment in Lagos or Accra
rented through Airbnb, at a fraction of the
cost of the oﬀer ings of the formal travel
industry and with much less hassle. That lets
him sidestep two of the main impediments to
trade and investment in many par ts of Afr ica.
But new apps and star tups will have an even
greater impact in areas where they solve

Or consider Flare, which bills itself as an
Uber for ambulances. Nairobi does not have a
centralised ambulance-dispatch system.
Getting one can take hours and require calls
to as many as 50 hospitals and ambulance
companies. Flare hopes that, through a
smar tphone app, it can dispatch ambulance
dr ivers to patients in much the same way that
cab-hailing companies link taxis and r iders.
“The really cool thing about what we’re doing
is that it is cloud-based and smar tphone-
dr iven,” says Caitlin Dolkar t, one of Flare’s
co-founders. LifeBank, a star tup in Lagos, is
working on a system that will do much the
same for blood deliver ies in a city without a
centralised blood bank. 
Meanwhile entrepreneurs in Niger ia are
looking at a tractor-shar ing service, and a
group in Kenya is trying out an app that will
link people who want to ship goods with
those who have empty or idle trucks. “Afr ica
has a lot more ineﬃciencies [than r ich coun-
tr ies], but that also means more oppor tuni-
ties,” says James Middleton, one of the
co-founders of Moovr. “Just as Afr icans
skipped past ﬁxed phone lines straight to
mobile phones, they can skip past owning a
vehicle straight to the shared economy.”

speciﬁcally Afr ican problems.
Take Moovr, an Uber for cows that was
founded by a group of students at King’s
College London. They hope to connect truck
dr ivers with farmers in remote areas who
want to get their cattle to market. For now
many of those farmers will each walk a single
cow to town, sometimes taking a week or
more, and then have to accept whatever pr ice
they are oﬀered.

bottlenecks in production and by lower-
ing barriers to making and selling things
to the world. Without the rapid advances
recently seen in digital design and manu-
facturing, the AHRLAC would never have
taken ﬂight. 
Other examples abound. In IBM’s
new innovation centre in Johannesburg a
3D printer turns out cases for wearable
electronics that IBM is developing to track
the spread of infectious diseases. Additive
manufacturing is helping to lower the cost
of innovation for ﬁrms across Africa. Until
recently, when BRCK wanted to make a
prototype for its Wi-Fi transmitters, it had
to order it from abroad, wait for weeks and
pay up to $250 in shipping and taxes for a
small part. Now that 3D printers are avail-
able in Nairobi, BRCK can get new proto-
types made in days for about $25.
Yet there are many aspects of tech-
nology where Africa is not moving fast
enough. In 2016 it bought only 400 indus-
trial robots, or less than 0.2% of the world’s
total. The lion’s share, 86%, went to Asia.
One reason why Africa buys so few is that its labour costs are low
and ﬁnance is diﬃcult to come by. Besides, it does not export a lot
of manufactured goods. That is a problem, because it runs huge
trade deﬁcits with the rest of the world and needs to export more
than just raw materials to provide jobs for the millions of young-
sters leaving school every year. It also matters because African
ﬁrms that export tend to grow faster and raise their productivity
more quickly than those that do not, says Dirk Willem te Velde of
the Overseas Development Institute in London. Africa’s weak in-
frastructure and ineﬃcient ports have put many potential ex-
porters oﬀ investing there. However, Andela, a high-tech ﬁrm,
demonstrates how pure brainpower can be exported from a
snazzy oﬃce block in Lagos to sophisticated customers halfway
round the world without going near an overcrowded port or bro-
ken railway line. 
Andela was founded on the premise that “talent is distri-
buted evenly around the world but opportunity is not,” says Je-
remy Johnson, the ﬁrm’s chief executive. It ﬁnds talented young
computer programmers (many of whom have taught them-
selves to code online, using websites), trains them intensively
and gets them to work remotely with mainly American tech
ﬁrms. The company (which counts Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg
among its investors) says its model is diﬀerent from that of Indian
outsourcing ﬁrms such as Tata Consultancy Services because its
developers become fully ﬂedged team members of the ﬁrms
they are contracted to, even though Andela bills for them and
provides ongoing training. For example, Andela collaborates
with Fathom, a company in Austin, Texas, that provides cloud-
based software used by water utilities across America, so in one
corner of the Lagos campus large blue banners proclaim “Fath-
om Team East”. Fathom’s oﬃce in Austin has a similar sign say-
ing “Fathom Team West”. 
Part of Andela’s appeal is that the cost of hiring a Nigerian
developer is less than half that of a similarly qualiﬁed worker in
Texas or California. More important, it helps tech ﬁrms overcome
a desperate shortage of good programmers. “We’re trying to ﬁnd
the best talent in every corner of the world, which means look-
ing beyond our own backyard,” says Chris Lambert, chief tech-
nology oﬃcer of Lyft, an American ride-hailing ﬁrm, who recent-
ly visited Lagos to see Andela. 

The Economist November 11th 2017

T E C H N O L O G Y I N A F R I C A

The search for talent has brought
other big tech ﬁrms to Africa too. Amazon,
for instance, opened a large centre in Cape
Town in 2004 where it developed much
of the technology used in its Elastic Cloud
Compute platform, now the main plank
of its web-services business. “This is
where we are building the next-genera-
tion technologies for Amazon Web Ser-
vices,” says Geoﬀ Brown, AWS’s regional
manager for sub-Saharan Africa. “In 2015
we continued expansion and opened an
oﬃce in Johannesburg, and since then
have added hundreds of jobs in the coun-
try to support the growth of AWS in Africa
and around the world.” 
Such businesses employ only a mi-
nuscule share of the local workforce, so
their direct impact is small, but the indi-
rect eﬀect will be signiﬁcant. Andela takes
about 40 people a month into its four-year
work-and-training programme. Its ﬁrst
graduates are due to ﬁnish soon, having
worked with startups across America.
Many of them want to found their own
technology ﬁrms, bringing to bear not just their newly acquired
skills but also a Silicon Valley mindset that embraces entrepre-
neurialism and a willingness to experiment. “We are hoping that
the people we are training in Andela today will become the
founders of the next Andela in ﬁve years’ time,” says Seni Suly-
man, who runs the Nigeria operation. In that sense, ﬁrms such as
Andela may be helping to deal with the real deﬁcit in Africa,
which is not a shortage of technology but of people willing and
able to adopt and adapt it.
“There is lots of tech already out there in the world. When
we go looking for it we can ﬁnd it,” says David Kelly, who runs a
venture-capital ﬁrm that starts greenﬁeld businesses in agricul-
ture and food processing throughout Africa. “It is the tech-adopt-
ers who are missing.” 7

AT LUNCHTIME IN Mombasa, Kenya’s humid port city,
groups of men gather in the shade for the day’s bunge la
mwananchi (people’s parliament), where they debate the latest
news and politics. Everyone takes his turn to discuss whether the
local governor is any good, or whether a group of men arrested
on charges of drug-smuggling should be extradited to America.
Then the debate turns to economics. “Why should we export all
of our tea to Britain?” asks one man. “It is because of the law of
comparative advantage,” retorts another. “How will Kenya ever
be able to catch up with the rich countries in Europe and Ameri-
ca?” To this, nobody has an answer.
That tech and innovation can play a big role in making
some countries richer than others is not in question. About half
the diﬀerences in GDP per person between countries are due to 

1

S P E C I A L R E P O R T

T E C H N O L O G Y I N A F R I C A

2 diﬀerences in productivity. Countries that encourage their ﬁrms
to innovate, and that invest in educating their people and push-
ing the boundaries of science, generally grow richer than those
that do not. Yet the hope that ideas and technologies would ﬂow
across borders like air and be adopted by poor countries, letting
them catch up quickly, has been realised only in part of the
world. Asian countries such as Japan and later Taiwan, South Ko-
rea and China embraced many of the world’s latest technologies
to build formidable manufacturing economies. But Africa was
largely left out of the most recent waves of globalisation, in
which labour-intensive manufacturing moved out of Europe
and America and into Asia. In 1990 African countries accounted
for about 9% of the developing world’s manufacturing output. By
2014 that share had slumped to 4%. 
One reason was pinpointed in a recent study by econo-
mists at the Centre for Global Development in Washington, DC.
It found that labour costs in Africa are about 60% higher than in
comparable countries such as Bangladesh. More striking still, the
capital cost of employing a worker in Kenya, at $10,000, is about
nine times as much as in Bangladesh. This is partly because indi-
rect costs caused by unreliable infrastructure, crime, corruption
and poor regulation, among other things, can account for 20-30%
of the total costs incurred by ﬁrms in Africa. 

Run, or walk ﬁrst?

So can technology help change the fortunes of Africa, or
should the region’s governments focus on getting ports and pow-
er to work? Among those arguing for concentrating ﬁrst on pow-
er, telecommunications and transport is Calestous Juma, a pro-
fessor at Harvard’s Kennedy School, who sees these as
“foundational infrastructure” upon which other industries can
grow. It is wrong to assume that “Africa can leap into the service
economy without ﬁrst building a manufacturing base,” he says.
Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the African Development
Bank, takes a similar view, even though he pioneered the use of
mobile-phone wallets to distribute fertiliser subsidies in a previ-
ous role as Nigeria’s agriculture minister. “You cannot develop in
the dark,” he says. “It requires a major eﬀort to ﬁx structural prob-
lems as well as infrastructural problems in Africa, so we

shouldn’t kid ourselves that we
can just bypass those.”
Yet there is also reason to
hope that even if technology is
not a panacea, it can still help re-
duce some of the costs and fric-
tions of doing business in Africa.
A recent paper for the World
Bank found that African ﬁrms
using the internet are nearly
four times as productive per em-
ployee as those that do not. But
until just a few years ago most
ﬁrms on the continent did not
get to enjoy the beneﬁts of high-
er productivity for lack of inter-
net connections. 
In much the same way that
solar power and minigrids are
changing the lives of villagers,
emerging technologies may pro-
vide big industrial ﬁrms with
power on an industrial scale.
One promising source is small-
scale 
liqueﬁed natural gas,
which will deliver commercial
quantities of gas without the
need to build huge pipelines.
“Technology is now letting you
get atomised, bite-sized bits of
infrastructure,” says Tope La-
wani, a co-founder of Helios, a
private-equity ﬁrm with investments across Africa.
To be fair, not all infrastructure can be “virtualised”, least of
all ports, roads and railways. But technology is steadily dis-
mantling barriers to growth. When venture capitalists made big
bets on African e-commerce ﬁrms such as Konga and Jumia, they
did not allow for the many diﬃculties such enterprises would
encounter. Cities such as Lagos had no reliable street maps and
addresses, no big logistics ﬁrms and no electronic payments sys-
tems to bill customers. Delivery drivers on motorcycles would
keep having to ask for directions, so deliveries took much longer
than expected. Often the buyers would have no cash and would
refuse to accept the goods. “There was a lot of hype and people
didn’t take into account the complications of operating in Afri-
ca,” says Manuel Koser, a founder of Silvertree Internet Holdings,
which invests in internet retail companies across the region.
Now companies such as Flutterwave and Paystack are
building electronic payments systems that will reduce costs
across the economy and enable others to build internet-com-
merce ﬁrms on them. What3words, a British ﬁrm that has invent-
ed a way of mapping places down to a grid reference identiﬁed
by three words, is helping governments like Nigeria’s to assign a
unique postcode to every home. 
Whether such eﬀorts will be enough to allow Africa to
catch up with the rich world, let alone “leapfrog” ahead of it, re-
mains far from certain. Yet that may be the wrong question to
ask. A more nuanced one would be whether the technologies
discussed in this report—from the internet and mobile phones to
simple plastic bags—can help overcome some of the barriers that
have long held back Africa’s economies and people. And on that
the evidence is clear, whether in the form of better health care for
mothers, more eﬀective education for children or bigger crops
and higher prices in the market for farmers. All this adds up to
grounds for optimism. 7

Through a seriesof“democraticconventions” acrossEurope(anotheridea tried outin France) shepherded byNathalie Loi-seau, hisEurope minister, MrMacron will seekto assemble a pro-gramme forthe 2019 election, and perhapsthe basisforhis owngroup in the parliament.

Astudyof90 countriesbyFairTrialsInternational, a campaigninggroup, found thatin 1990 just19 used someform ofplea-bargaining. Now66 do. Plea-bargainingtookoﬀin Americaaround 1920 with Prohibition, which led toasteep increase in the numberofcriminaloﬀences. By1930 the numberoffederalsiﬁed. Amongthe countrieswhere Ameri-ca helped newgovernmentswith legal re-formsare Bolivia, Colombia, Poland andRussia. Plea-bargainingwasoften amongthe suggested reforms. OPDAT isnowhelpingto write guid-ance on criminal procedures, includingplea-bargaining, in Croatia and the west-ern Balkans. In Ukraine ittrainsjustice oﬃ-cialsin the system. Lastyearitstarted workwith Guatemala on introducingplea-bar-gainingto cleara backlogofcases.American inﬂuence, however, isnot theonlyreason forplea bargains’ spread. Tran-sitionsto democracyoften involve shiftingfrom “inquisitorial” systemsassociatedwith discredited regimes, in which judgesplayan investigative role, saysRebeccaShaeﬀerofFairTrialsInternational. Ascountriesadopted adversarial systems, inwhich judgesactasrefereesbetween theprosecution and defence, theyalso soughtto expand capacity—and introducingplea-bargainingenabled them to handle morecases. More broadly, plea-bargainingcan cutcostsand delays. Withoutan incentive toplead guilty, even defendantsfacingover-whelmingevidence maydecide to taketheirchancesin court. Finland brought inplea-bargainsin 2015 aftera seriesofcasesin which the European CourtofHumanRightsruled thatithad violated citizens’rightto a timelytrial.Aplea bargain can even oﬀeran imme-diate route outofjail. Around the world al-most3m people are held in pre-trial deten-tion. Manydefendantsspend longerinpre-trial detention than the maximum sen-tencestheyface. Atthatpoint, “ofcoursetheywantto plead guiltyto getoutof pri-son,” saysIsadora Fingermann, a Brazilianformercriminal lawyerwho nowworksincriminal-justice reform.Anotherbeneﬁtofplea-bargaining isprosecutionsunderthe Prohibition Actalone waseighttimesthe total ﬁgure forallfederal prosecutionsin 1914. Bargainingwith defendantsto plead guiltyin returnforlighterpunishmentseemed like theonlywayto cope. Prohibition ended in1933, butplea bargainsdid not. Since 1970,when the Supreme Courtruled thattheywere permissible, theyhave become ubiq-uitous. In 1980 some 19% offederal defen-dantswentto trial. In 2010 the share wasbelow3%, where itremains. Practice in othercountriesvaries wide-ly. In Australia, England and Russia morethan 60% ofcasesare resolved with pleabargains. In Chile, India and Italy, the shareislessthan 10%. Some recentconvertstoplea bargainshave adopted them withvim. In Georgia, which hasallowed themsince 2004, the share ofconvictionsthat in-volved a plea bargain rose from 13% in 2005to 88% in 2012.

Butsince then aseriesofmiscarriagesofjustice and newpsychological research suggestthat, all toooften, thatiswhathappens. In 2002 Brian Banks, a high-school foot-ball player, wasaccused ofrape and kid-nappingbyan acquaintance. Afterhisar-rest, prosecutorsoﬀered him the chance toplead guiltyand spend justa fewyears injail, orto go to trial where he could face upto 41yearsifconvicted. He tookthe deal.Afterhe wasreleased, hisalleged victimcontacted him. Theymetand, in a conver-sation which he recorded, she admittedthatshe had invented the incident. In 2012he wasexonerated.MrBanksisnotalone in pleading guiltyto a crime he did notcommit. Ofthe 149Americansabsolved ofcrimesin 2015, 65had pleaded guilty. The Innocence Project,an organisation thatusesDNA evidence tore-examine convictions, hasproven the in-nocence of300-odd people, mostofthemconvicted forrape and murder. Atleast 30had pleaded guilty. Accordingto the Na-tional RegistryofExonerations, a collabo-ration between several lawschools, aquarterofAmericanscleared ofmurderbetween 1989 and 2012 had confessed. Butsuch ﬁguresonlyhintatthe scale of theproblem. Often, plea bargainsare condi-tional on givingup the rightto challenge aconviction later. And exoneration eﬀortsfocuson seriouscrimes, where sentencesare longand there ismore likelyto be fo-rensicevidence. Researchersare startingto demonstratehowcommon false confessionsare likelyto be. In a studyin 2013 byLucian Dervanofthe BelmontUniversityCollege ofLaw,togetherwith Vanessa Edkins, a psycholo-gistatthe Florida Institute ofTechnology,studentswere asked to solve logicpro-blems, ﬁrstin a team and then alone. Anaccomplice ofthe researchersasked halfthe participantsforhelp on the second set.All were then accused ofcheatingand of-fered a “plea bargain” to avoid penaltiesthatcould include losingthe payment forparticipation and havingtheirsupervisorsnotiﬁed. Nearly90% ofthose who had aid-ed the accomplice confessed. Butso did amajorityofthose who were innocent.MrDervan isnowrunningstudiesin Ja-pan, which isintroducingplea-bargaining,and South Korea, which maydo so. Japan,where criminal suspectsmaybe held for 23dayswithoutcharge, often with onlymini-mal contactwith a lawyer, perhapsde-prived ofsleep, isalreadyworryingly goodatextractingconfessions. Plea bargains arebeingbroughtin aspartofthe horse-trad-ingovera largercriminal-justice reform, inwhich prosecutorsopposed to routine re-cordingofinterrogationshave managed tolimitit, in exchange forformal recognitionofplea-bargainingand otheraidsto inves-tigatingcomplexcrimes. Earlyresultssuggestthatthe “inno-cence issue” isuniversal, saysMrDervan.Diﬀerencesin legal systemsdo notchangethe rate offalse confessionsmuch. Anoth-erstudyhe isconductingsuggeststhatguiltyparticipantsare no more likely toplead guiltyifoﬀered a bigincentive ratherthan a small one. Innocentones, however,become more likelyto make false confes-sionsasthe incentive—in otherwords thepenaltyforrejectingthe deal—rises.The fearthatplea bargainsmayinducefalse confessionsmeansmanycountrieshave strictrulesregardingtheiruse. Japanwill limitthem to seriouscrimeswhere theaccused informson someone else. In Ger-many, South Africa and Spain defendantsare shown all the evidence to be presentedagainstthem before theydecide whetherto accepta deal. In Germany, the discount-ed sentence cannotbe lessthan the statu-toryminimum forthatcrime. In England,sentencescan be cutbyatmosta third.In America, bycontrast, prosecutorshave broad freedom to slash sentences, in-cludingforcrimesthatcarrythe death pen-alty. Extremelylongsentences, manda-tory-sentencingrulesand untrammelledprosecutorial discretion add up to a systemthatalmostseemsdesigned forabuse. And yetso entrenched are plea bar-gainsin America thatthe occasional at-temptsto do withoutthem have failed. Be-tween 1975 and 1990 theywere banned inAlaska. Even then, theyhappened infor-mally. Judgesmade implicitdealswith de-fendantswho pleaded guilty. One studyfound thatsentencesaftertrialsfor violentcrimeswere, on average, 445% longerthanthose given afterpleas. Forfraud, theywere 334% longer. The Texan cityofEl Pasobanned plea-bargainingin 1975. Duringthefollowingtwo yearsthe trial rate doubledand the two judgesassigned to criminalcasescould notcope. Ten more were as-signed to help them, buteven so prosecu-torsstarted to strike secretbargains, withjudges’ encouragement. The ban waseven-tuallyrescinded.The extensive use ofplea-bargainingcan reshape an entire criminal-justice sys-tem. Bydeﬁnition, itmeansfewertrials—and therefore feweroccasionson whichpolice and prosecutorsmustmake a solidcase in an open courtroom. The ability tocarryoutinvestigationscan atrophy. Andstatutesthatare vague orunjustmay go un-challenged because so fewcasesgo to trial. Fordefendantswho plead guilty, theconsequencesgo beyond any(reduced)sentence theymustserve orﬁne they mustpay. In Europe criminal recordsare usuallywiped clean ofall butthe mostserious of-fencesaftersome time, provided people donotre-oﬀend. In the meantime, however,sensitive jobssuch asteachingorpublicadministration are likelyto be oﬀ-limits.And minortransgressions, such astraﬃcoﬀences, maybe punished more harshly.In manyAmerican statesthe conse-quencesare more severe and long-lasting.Criminal recordsmayneverbe expungedand maymean beingbarred from voting,evicted from publichousing, denied wel-fare orturned awaywhen applyingfor ajob. The extra legal restrictionsplaced onpeople with criminal records, some bi-zarrelyspeciﬁc, mean theyare more vul-nerable to future charges. In Illinois, forex-ample, itisa crime to own a dogthat hasnotbeen spayed orneutered—butonlyforpeople with a criminal record.Tilting the scalesAll thissuggeststhatdefendantsshouldcarefullyweigh the long-term conse-quencesofa guiltyplea. Butitseems theydo not—even when explicitlynudged to doso. In a separate study, MrDervan foundthatinformingparticipantsaboutthoseconsequencesmade little diﬀerence to thelikelihood thattheywould accepta deal.“Ifpleadingguiltymeansyougetto gohome, mostwill plead guilty,” he says.When the justice system isstacked againstdefendants, theyare unlikelyto gambletheirfuturesforitsgreatergood. 7The EconomistNovember11th201753For daily coverage of business, visitEconomist.com/business-ﬁnance 1ATFIRSTglance the chip businessandthe Serengeti appearto have little incommon.

In particular, he has con-nectionsto America’sprivate-equityin-dustry. SilverLake, a prominentbuy-outﬁrm thatownsa stake in Broadcom, is pro-viding$5bn in ﬁnancingforthe proposedtakeover, alongside banks. Mostsemiconductorﬁrmsare run byelectrical engineerswho see engineeringasthe solution to theirproblems, says MrTan, who wasborn in Malaysia, studiedengineeringatthe MassachusettsInstituteofTechnologyand then businessatHar-vard BusinessSchool. He tackleshisindus-trymore like a private-equityboss, ﬁndingﬁrmsthatare bloated and cuttingcosts.“He ran through Broadcom with a ma-chete,” saysStacyRasgon ofBernstein Re-search. Accordingto LinleyGwennap ofthe LinleyGroup, a consultancyfocusedon semiconductors, MrTan eliminated anentire layerofmanagementatBroadcomand nowhasaround 20 businessunitsre-portingdirectlyto him.

There isno end in sight. MrTan hassuggested thatnewowner-ship could lead to a more amicable rela-tionship between Qualcomm and custom-erssuch asApple, although there islittleevidence forthatview. In a fewareas, in-cludingconnectivitychipsthatenableWi-Fi and radio-frequencychips, Broad-com and Qualcomm compete; havingagiantﬁrm with more marketpowerisnotlikelyto please chip buyers. Ifthey com-bined, with no divestments, Qualcommand Broadcom would control between50%-60% ofthe marketforWi-Fi chips and27% ofradio-frequencychipsformobiledevices.

Broadcom could raise itsprice tosee through a deal, orpursue a hostile bid.Buteven ifBroadcom winsthe support ofQualcomm’sbossesand shareholders,there are large risks, saysGeoﬀBlaber ofCCSInsight, a research group. With Qual-comm’spendingpurchase ofNXPandBroadcom’sofBrocade, whatlooksat ﬁrstglance like a mergerbetween two giants isactuallya four-sided deal. Itwould be diﬃ-cultto unite so manydiﬀerentdivisionsand businessunitsall atonce. Asecond riskisregulatory. The Euro-pean Commission’songoinginvestigationofQualcomm’sproposed acquisition ofNXPissuggestive ofthe close scrutiny thatanothermega-deal in chipscould receivein Europe, saysThomasVinje, head of anti-trustatCliﬀord Chance, a lawﬁrm, in Brus-sels.

He vowsthatslashingthe rate ofcorporate tax willcreate millionsofjobs. In the end, on No-vember2nd, Republican leadersin theHouse ofRepresentativesunveiled themodestlynamed TaxCutsand JobsAct. Some businessleaderscheered. The USChamberofCommerce called ita “once-in-a-generation opportunityto ﬁxthe pro-blem”. The National Association ofManu-facturersdeclared the plan “a grand slamforhardworkingmanufacturers”. The billisexpected to reach a vote thismonth inthe House, afterwhich itmustbe recon-ciled with a Senate taxbill due soon.The centrepiece ofthe plan isa big re-duction in the headline rate ofcorporatetaxation from 35% to 20%. The proposalalso allowscapital investmentto be de-ducted in full immediately, ratherthanovertime. Itwould move America to a ter-ritorial system thattaxesﬁrmson incomewhere itisearned, while taxingthe $1.3trnorso ofcash parked overseasbyAmericanmultinationals(MNCs) at12%. Thatallbroadlypleasesbusiness.Butthere islessthere than meets theeye. American ﬁrmsdo appearto paynear-lythe highestratesin the world, but thanksto existingdeductions, creditsand loop-holes, the actual taxrate paid byﬁrms isal-readycloserto 20% than 35% (see chart).The laudable proposal to allowthem towrite oﬀinvestmentsin full immediatelyisscheduled to expire afterﬁve years. Andthe reform ofMNCtaxation includesan ex-cise taxof20% on all paymentsmade byﬁrmsin America to foreign aﬃliates, a mis-chievousbordertaxthatangersMNCsasitwould disruptglobal supplychains.Those grumblespointto a biggerpro-blem forMrTrump. Though billed asaboon forbusiness, the House taxplan hasnumerousprovisionsthatthreaten power-ful industries. These vested interests arenowbusytwistingarmson Capitol Hill.Homebuildersand real-estate agentsarefumingabouta change to a long-standingsubsidyforhomeowners. The proposalwould cap the deductibilityofinterestpaid on mortgages(see page 63). Today,people can deductintereston home loansworth up to $1m. Underthe House propos-al, thiswould be cutto $500,000. The Na-tional Association ofHomebuilderswarnsthiscould cause a housingrecession. The National Federation ofIndepen-dentBusinessalso opposesthe bill, claim-ingit“leavestoo manysmall businessesbehind”. The House plan introducesa 25%taxrate fornon-corporate “pass-through”businesses, such aspartnershipsand cor-porations, which todaypasson businessincome directlyto shareholdersfortax-ation on theirpersonal taxreturns. Own-ersofsuch companies, who currentlypayindividual taxratesapproaching40%,would beneﬁtgreatly—butthe 25% taxpro-posal mostlyexcludesdoctors, lawyersand accountants. The businessconstituencythatmay bemostunhappywith the bill isthe private-equity(PE) industry. The taxplan would re-strictthe amountofinterestthatmostﬁrmscould deductfrom taxesat30% ofearningsbefore interest, taxes, deprecia-tion and amortisation. Since takingonlarge amountsofdebtto buycompanies iscentral to the PEbusinessmodel, thispro-posal isa seriousthreatto future returns.The barbariansatthe gate are unlikely togo down withouta ﬁght. 7American business and tax Give and takeNEW YORKBusiness reaction to the Republicans’big tax-reform plan is mixedMyth and realitySource: Congressional Budget OfficeCorporate-tax rates, 2012, %, selected countries010203040ArgentinaBritainUnited StatesBrazilFranceChinaSouth KoreaEffectiveStatutoryThe EconomistNovember11th2017 Business551INRECENTmonthsGoogle and Facebookhave made changesthatmayescape thenotice ofmostoftheirbillionsofusers, butnotofnewsorganisations.

RecentlyGoogle NewsLab, formed in 2015, helped fund “ReportforAmerica”, which will putan initial 18 re-portersin small-town newsroomsacrossthe country, with more to come in futureyears. Facebookstarted a “Journalism Pro-ject” in Januaryto help develop newspro-ductsin collaboration with newspapers.

Asmore pub-lishersputup paywallsonline, theylob-bied Google to limitfree access.

Whereverjournalism turns,Facebookand Google loom large. Their re-centmoves, although welcome to manypublishers, are unlikelyto alterthe trajec-toryofthe relationship. 7THE titansofmedia in America have de-cided thisisan opportune moment tojoin togetherin mega-mergers, the better totake on the giantsofSilicon Valley. The pro-blem forthem isthatthe DepartmentofJustice (DoJ), and PresidentDonald Trumphimself, are lesskeen.On November8th reportssurfaced thatthe DoJ ispreparingto blocka proposed$109bn acquisition byAT&TofTime War-ner, ownerofCNN, HBOand the WarnerBrothersﬁlm studio—a deal thatwasan-nounced a yearago and which had beenexpected to win approval bythe end of2017. The DoJhave reportedlytold AT&Tex-ecutivesthatto getthe mergerthrough theywould have to sell oﬀassets: either TimeWarner’sTurnerBroadcastingdivision, in-cludingCNN, which MrTrump hasrepeat-edlyattacked as“fake news”, orDirecTV,the wirelessgiant’ssatellite-TVbusiness.Randall Stephenson, AT&T’schiefexecu-tive, said on November8th he would notsell CNNto secure the deal. Time Warner’sshare price fell by6.5% inone day, to nearly$20 belowthe agreed ac-quisition price of$107.50 pershare. Apossi-ble courtbattle looms, ata time when oth-erindustryplayersare eyeingconsolidation. Itwasalso reported thisweekthatDisneyhashad talkswith 21stCenturyFoxaboutbuyingmuch ofthegroup; although the discussionsended in-conclusively, RupertMurdoch and hissons, Jamesand Lachlan, who togetheroversee Fox, maybe open to the idea ofselling. The travailsofAT&Tand Time War-nercould give cluesto the fate ofother pos-sible media deals. Some suggestpoliticsisatwork: thatMrTrump intervened with the DoJto scuttle adeal thathe criticised duringhiselectioncampaign asa symbol ofunfairconcentra-tion ofmedia power. ButifMrTrump is notdirectlyinvolved, whatelse isgoing on?The acquisition doesnotinvolve conven-tional antitrustconcerns, in thatit isa verti-cal integration ofdistribution (wireless,broadband and satellite-TV) and content(TVnetworks, HBOand ﬁlms). In the pastthe DoJhasbeen more concerned withhorizontal mergersthatcreate marketdominance in one industry. Yetthere islegitimate reason for scruti-ny. AT&T’scommandingpresence in distri-bution, especiallyin wireless—ithas butone like-sized rival, Verizon—raisesthe po-tential forabuse asitsellscontent. Itistruethatregulatorscould seeka promise fromAT&Tthatitnotfavouritsown networks,such asHBO, and thatitnotdiscriminateagainstrival companies’ networksasitsetscarriage terms. Similarassuranceswere ex-tracted from Comcastwhen itboughtNBCUniversal in 2011, a vertical mergerthatwentthrough. Butitisdiﬃcultto enforcesuch behavioural conditions. Norwould a forced sale ofassets neces-sarilysolve competition issues. Selling Di-recTVwould notdentthe carrier’sstrengthin wireless. Sellingthe Turnernetworkswould still leave AT&Twith the ﬁrm’smostvaluable contentbrand, HBO. Eithersalemightbe so onerousto execute, however,thatitwould probablystop the merger. Whateverthe DoJdecides, the logicofmergersremains. Netﬂixdeliverscontentto 109m customers; Amazon isdoingthesame fortensofmillionsofPrime custom-ers. To compete in the future TVmarket,media executivesbelieve thattheyneed toachieve scale in both distribution and con-tent.

Bycontrast, championsofICOshold that, al-though theyare initiallyused to raisefunds, theyalso often have a function inthe projectstheyﬁnance and hence shouldbe treated diﬀerently. In Filecoin, an onlinemarketfordigital storage thatraised a re-cord $257m, the tokenswill be used to payorgetpaid forspace on diskdrives.Tokens ofaﬀectionMostissuerswill have a hard time convinc-ingthe SECand otherregulatorsthattheirsisa “utilitytoken”. Formanyexistingﬁrms,such asKik, a messagingapp, which raisednearly$100m, raisingfundsseemsthe pri-ority. Forotherissuersthe problem is thatthe tokenstheyare sellingare forprojectsthatexistonlyon paper, and so have nootherfunction than to bringin money. Andmostinvestorscurrentlybuytokensnot fortheirutility, butbecause theyare bettingthattheirvalue will rocket.To avoid the heaviestregulation, issuersare keepingthe lawyersbusy. One increas-inglypopularlegal constructin America iscalled SAFT(“Simple AgreementforFutureTokens”)—in eﬀect, optionsto buytokens,ratherthan tokensthemselves, thusdodg-ingthe problem posed byprojectsthat donotyetuse the tokens. Asraisingmoneygetsharder, marketingbecomesmore im-portant. One resultisthe “pre-sale”, inwhich earlyinvestorsoften geta big dis-ulatorshave neverseen a newﬁnancialproductexplode with the speed and veloc-ity[ofICOs].”Unsurprisingly, supervisorshavestepped in. China and South Korea, whereICOshad become partofthe local gam-blingculture, have alreadyoutlawed them.Manyregulatorsin Western countrieshave bynowmade clearthattheyconsideratleastsome ofthe coins(or“tokens”) thatare distributed in an ICOto be securities,which need to be regulated assuch, withall thatthisentailsin disclosure and otherrequirements. Leadingthe pack, the SECsaid in a reporton the DAO, an ill-fated ear-lyICO, thatoﬀeringsofthiskind need to beregistered (orapplyforan exemption). Butbigregulatoryproblemsremain unsolved.The mostpressingopen question iswhata token reallyrepresents, saysPetervan Valkenburgh ofCoin Centre, a think-tank. Technically, the answerisstraightfor-ward, atleastforthose familiarwithcrypto-currencies. Tokensare mostlyen-trieson Ethereum, a “blockchain”, or“dis-tributed ledger”, copiesofwhich live onmanyconnected computersaround theworld—much like the one thatunderliesbitcoin. The Ethereum ledger, however, notonlykeepstrackofa currency, called“ether”, buthostswhatare known as“smartcontracts”, programsthatencodebusinessrules.

The cyclicallyadjusted price-earningsratio (CAPE), ascalculated byRobertShillerofYale University, averagesproﬁtsoverten yearsand isused by manyasan importantvaluation indicator. Cur-rentlyitshowsthatAmerican shares havehitherto been more highlyvalued only in1929 and the late 1990s, periodsthatwerefollowed bybigcrashes.Thatseemsominous. Butasa paper byDylan Grice and GregorObrechtofCali-brium, a Zurich-based private-investmentoﬃce, makesclear, itisfarfrom conclu-sive. The CAPEisnotmuch use asa short-term indicator; ithasbeen well above itslong-term average forseveral years now,asitwasin the late 1990s.The main argumentforthe CAPEisalong-term one. Ifyoudivide all past CAPEvaluesinto quintiles, the annual returnsearned overthe subsequentdecade by in-vestingin equitieswhen the CAPEwasinitsmost-expensive quintile were morethan eightpercentage pointsbelowthe re-turnsearned when the CAPEwasin itscheapestquintile (see chart). However, the case islesscut-and-driedthan those numbersseem. First, MessrsGrice and Obrechtpointoutthatthis ap-proach issubjectto hindsightbias. Thelong-term valuation range maybe clearnow; pastinvestorsdid notknowtherange when theywere actuallybuyingshares. Ifthe data are adjusted to reﬂectthe historical data available to investors atthe time, then the outperformance gapfallsbymore than a percentage point.Amore seriousproblem relatesto thequantityofthe data. MrShillerhas 146yearsofnumbersforearnings; that breaksdown into only14 completelyindepen-dentten-yearperiods. Itispretty diﬃcultto create a robuststatistical case from suchapaucityofnumbers.The authorscalculate that, based oncurrentvaluations, the bestforecast forten-yearreal annual returnsfrom Americanequitiesis2.6%, well belowthe historicalaverage. Butthe range ofreturnscan onlybe estimated with reasonable conﬁdenceto be between -3.4% and +8.7%; somethingthatislikelyto seem too broad to be ofmuch use to professional investors.These criticismsare fair. So why, never-theless, doesitstill seem likelythat a highCAPEportendslowerfuture returns? Fu-ture equityreturnscan come from onlytwo sources—growth in proﬁts, orthe mar-ket’splacinga highervaluation on thoseproﬁts. Forexample, a high CAPEmightbejustiﬁed when proﬁtsare unusuallylow,bythe hope thatearningswill recover. However, proﬁtsare high, relative toGDP,atthe moment. Perhapsthisisthe re-sultofa shiftin powerin favourof capital,atthe expense oflabour; perhapsitis theresultofthe greaterconcentration of someindustries, which hasgiven certain busi-nessesmonopoly-like margins. Itispossi-ble thatthisshiftispermanent, and thatproﬁtswill notfall backastheyhave inpreviouscycles. Butitseemsthe height ofoptimism to believe thatproﬁtswill growfasterthan GDP, ie, thatthe overall shareofcapital will rise even further. GDPgrowth isitselflargelydriven ei-therbyan increasingnumberofworkersorbya rise in theirproductivity. Since thesize ofthe workforce isrisingmore slowly(and issetto fall in some countries), andrecentproductivitygrowth hasbeen dis-appointing, itishard to be more optimis-ticon thisscore. So rapid growth in eitherGDPorproﬁtslooksdiﬃcultto achieve.Turningto valuation, some believethatthe CAPEhastrended higherin recentdecadesbecause ofbetteraccountingstandardsand corporate governance.Earninghigh returnsin an era ofsluggishproﬁtsgrowth would require valuationsto rise even further, reachingdotcom-eralevels. Even a partial reversion to themean (the long-term CAPEaverage is16.8compared with about30 today) would beverybad news. Here, too, there isa natu-ral limiton returns.However, the authorspointoutthat in-vestorsare notlookingatequities in isola-tion; theyare choosingbetween assetclassesincludingcash (yieldingvirtuallynothing) and governmentbonds. Gov-ernment-bond yieldsare verylowin his-torical terms; in otherwords, valuationsare veryhigh. Acomparison ofthe ex-pected returnsfrom equitiesand bondsshowsequitiesshould perform much bet-ter, even given the high level ofthe CAPE. Thatinsightchimeswith the views ofmanyfund managers.

Butotherassetclasses lookeven worseEconomist.com/blogs/buttonwoodcountto help boostdemand forthe ICO.Asecond bigopen question iswhere to-kenswill ﬁtinto the regulatorylandscape.Beingpiecesofcode, theycan take on theform ofanyﬁnancial product. “Theycol-lapse all assetclassesinto one,” saysLexSokolin ofAutonomousResearch, a con-sultancy. Thiswill cause legal friction, par-ticularlyin America, where diﬀerent assetclassesare regulated bydiﬀerentagencies.Otherjurisdictionsare easierto navi-gate. Manycrypto ﬁrmsare based in Zug,Switzerland, where theycan save taxesand tokensare lesslikelyto be consideredsecurities. In Januarya “distributed-ledgertechnologyframework” will go into eﬀectin Gibraltar(although itdoesnotspeciﬁcal-lyaddressICOs). Abigunknown isChinawhich, despite itsICOban, isclearlyinter-ested in all thingscrypto, aslongas itcancontrol them.And third, there isthe question of howthe organisationsﬁnanced byICOswill begoverned. Findingrobustsolutionsis vital:manyofthese entitiessee themselves asanewtype ofﬁrm. The idea isthatbecausefounders, employeesand usersall hold to-kens, theirincentivesare aligned: all havean interestin expandingtheirnetwork,which will drive up the tokens’ value.These organisationswill be “decentral-ised”, meaningthatno single group will bein charge, and theywill be managed, atleastpartially, bysmartcontractsto keepthem on track.Makingall thisworkwill be hard, asshown bythe case ofTezos, which raised$232m to ﬁnance the developmentofan-otherblockchain. Itsversion will comewith a sophisticated governance mecha-nism to avoid the problemsthatbeset bit-coin, which in Augustsplitin two when de-velopersand ﬁrmsthatcryptographicallymint(“mine”) the currencydisagreed onthe wayforward.

Itsbondshave been pricedatlevelsimplyingimminentbankruptcy,butsomehowthe cash-strapped oil ex-porterhasstayed aﬂoat. Until now. On No-vember2nd NicolásMaduro, the coun-try’sauthoritarian president, announcedthathe would ordera “reﬁnancingand re-structuring” offoreign debtworth about$105bn. The pricesofgovernmentbondsfell byup to half. Marketsbraced them-selvesforone ofhistory’smostcomplexsovereign-debtrenegotiations.MrMaduro’sbriefstatementwascryp-ticasto the concrete stepshe will take. Heinvited “everyone involved in foreigndebt” to talksin Caracas, the capital, on No-vember13th. Manycreditorswanta neu-tral venue. Moreover, MrMaduro appearsto have pre-emptivelydashed anyhope ofavoluntaryagreementbynaminghisvice-president, TareckEl Aissami, ashead ofhisdebt-restructuringcommittee. America’sTreasurydepartmenthasdesignated Mr ElAssami a drugkingpin, meaningthatAmericanscannotdeal with him. Sanctionsalso preventAmerican enti-tiesfrom buyinganynewdebtissued bythe RepublicofVenezuela with maturitieslongerthan 30 days, or90 daysforthe debtofPDVSA, the state oil company—a pro-blem if, say, a restructuringinvolved an ex-change ofdefaulted bondsfornewones. Intheory, PresidentDonald Trump could ad-justthe rulesbutstill preventanynewmoneyfrom ﬂowingto MrMaduro. Fornow, however, no proposed changesto theAmerican sanctionshave been aired.IfVenezuela runsoutofcash withoutreachingan agreement, itcould simplystop payingitsdebts. Butthatwould berisky, because PDVSAholdsvaluable prop-ertyabroad, includingCitgo, a reﬁner inAmerica, and a ﬂeetofoil tankers. After adefault, creditorsmightbe able to seizethose assets. Thatwould severelydisruptPDVSA’soperationsand wreakfurtherhavocon the Venezuelan economy, whichhasshrunkbyovera third since 2013.So MrMaduro’splan isa mystery—if hehasone atall. On the dayhe announcedthe reﬁnancing, he also said thatPDVSAwould make the ﬁnal $1.2bn paymenton amaturingbond. The moneyhasyettoreach creditors, butmostofitisreported tohave leftPDVSA’saccounts. Americansanctionshave scared oﬀbanks, creatinglogistical hurdlesthatcan delaytransfers.Anotherpaymenta weekearlierwasheldup fordaysbuteventuallycompleted.IfVenezuela were indeed aboutto re-nege on itsdebts, an extra $1.2bn wouldsurelycome in handy. One interpretationofMrMaduro’sperplexingapproach isthathe mayhope to continue servicingPDVSA’sdebtsbutwelsh on those contract-ed bythe state. ItisPDVSAthatholdsthevulnerable assetsabroad. And more of itsbondsthan the Republic’slack“collective-action” clauses. Thatmakesitimpossibleto force holdoutcreditorsinto a dealagreed to bya majorityofbondholders. However, foreign courtsare likely tofrown on anyeﬀortbyMrMaduro to pickand choose which lendersto snub. Sepa-rately, Crystallex, a Canadian mining ﬁrm,hasﬁled a lawsuitin America claiming thatPDVSAisan “alterego” ofthe Republic. If itsucceeds, government-bond holderscouldpressclaimsagainstPDVSA. Anothertheory, advanced byRafaelGuzmán, an opposition congressman, isthatMrMaduro mayhave wanted a sell-oﬀofthe country’sbonds. Venezuela or itsforeign patrons, mainlyRussia and China,could then buythem up cheaplyso Vene-zuela could retire itsdebtatlowercost, orleave itin the handsofsympatheticallies.An even more conspiratorial explana-tion hasbeen mooted byJavierRuízof Ca-racasChronicles, an opposition-friendlyblog. The governmenthad spooked mar-ketsbyusing30-daygrace periodsto delayinterestpayments, loweringbond prices.MrRuízwondered whetherthe govern-menthad tipped insidersoﬀthatitwouldactuallycough up the ﬁnal $1.2bn, asa laststop on the Venezuelan-debtgravytrainbefore paymentsceased.Besidesexploitingcontractual grace pe-riods, Venezuela hasyetto missa payment.And itsbondsstill mostlytrade at20-30centson the dollar—a bigdiscount, but farabove the single-digitpricesto which de-faulted debtoften sinks. In part, thosepricesreﬂectVenezuela’slong-run funda-mentals. Ithasthe world’slargestprovenoil reserves. Agovernmentthatpursuedsensible economicpoliciescould probablyservice the debtswithin a fewyears.Butthe relativelyhigh pricesmay alsosuggestthatsome investorsthinkMrMa-duro isbluﬃng. Venezuela’sbiggestpay-mentsof2017 are nowbehind it, and the oilprice hasrecentlyrisen. Moreover, Vladi-mirPutin, Russia’spresident, appearsto bestickingbyhisVenezuelan friends. Rus-sian-controlled entitieshave already pro-vided the countrywith atleast$17bn ofﬁ-nancing. And Russian oﬃcialsrecentlyagreed to restructure a $3bn loan. IfMrPu-tin seesa commercial advantage to Russiain proppingup hisoil-rich anti-Americanallyata costofa fewbillion dollars, pickingup Venezuelan debton the cheap mayyetturn outto be a bargain. 7Venezuela’s debtBusted ﬂushMysterysurrounds Venezuela’s approach to restructuring its massive debtsMaduro has a cunning plan.

He waslike a “kid in a can-dystore”, accordingto one editorofhisletters. Besides the Bol-shoi balletand the embalmed corpse ofStalin, he visited a Stalin-grad tractorworks, a machinery-makerin Yekaterinburgand aniron-and-steel plantin Magnitogorsk. In a letter, he wondered ifthe SovietUnion’seconomicapproach, “shorn ofviolence andcoercion”, could help the world achieve peace and prosperity. The answer, ofcourse, was“no”. ButNehruconcluded other-wise, incorporatingSovietideasinto India’sﬁve-yearplansandwelcomingSovietaid, equipmentand expertise. In the year ofhisvisit, the Russianssetup a steel factoryin whatisnow the Indianstate ofChhattisgarh. Itbecame India’smain supplierofrails. Nehruwasnotalone. The Sovietmodel impressed manylead-ersin the poorerpartsofthe world. Even today, according toCharlesRobertson ofRenaissance Capital, an investment bank,“more than a fewsuggestthata Stalin mightbe needed to kick-startindustrialisation” in poorcountries. The Sovietapproachrested on a varietyofarguments, notesRobertAllen of OxfordUniversity, such asthe need fora bigpush in industry, the abun-dance ofrural labourand the superiorityofcollective farming.The Sovietsbelieved thatindustrialisation would succeed enmasseornotatall. Those steel plants, tractorfactories and ma-chinery-makersneeded to operate on a bigenough scale to justifythe heavyupfrontcostofbuildingthem. And the success ofanyone industrial venture depended on complementaryinvest-mentsin others. Upstream suppliersneed downstream buyersand vice versa. Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, a Bolshevikeconomist,argued thata broad advance wasneeded acrossthe whole indus-trial front, notan “unco-ordinated advance bythe method ofcap-italistguerrilla warfare”. The workersforthisindustrial advance could be found inabundance on the farms, the Sovietsbelieved. Agriculture wassoovermanned itcould lose millionsofﬁeld-handswithout muchdamage to the harvest. Thatwasjustaswell, because the remain-ingpeasantrywould have to feed the factoryworkersas well asthemselves. One wayoranother, resourceswould have to betransferred from the countryside to the cities. Byorganising thepeasantryinto collective farms, the Sovietshoped to make themmore productive—and easierto “tax”. Acollective farm was, theybelieved, easierto collectfrom. The Sovietapproach succeeded in industrialisingthe econ-omy. Between 1928 and 1940 itsmanufacturingoutputgrewbyover170% (see left-hand chart), even asthe restofthe world wal-lowed in the Depression. Bythe second world war, itwas well onitswayto becomingthe industrial candy-store so admired byNehru. Thisbrute industrial expansion did not, however, vali-date the theoriesunderlyingthe Sovietapproach. To increasemanufacturingoutputby170%, the Bolshevikshad to increase in-putsbyeven greaterpercentages: the non-agricultural workforcehad to growbyalmost190% and the amountofcapital in that sec-torbya phenomenal 336%, accordingto ﬁguresreported by An-ton Cheremukhin ofthe Federal Reserve BankofDallasand co-authors. The Soviets, in otherwords, could move resources intothe factories, buttheycould notmaintain the eﬃciency withwhich theywere used. More importantly, the peasantrydid notsurrender“surplus”workersand grain withoutimmense economicdamage, bitter re-sistance and widespread suﬀering. Stalin expropriated, expelledorexterminated manyofthe mostprosperousand sophisticatedfarmers(the “kulaks”), requisitioned grain atlowpricesand triedto nationalise draught-animals. In response, aggrieved farmerssimplyslaughtered theirhorsesand oxen orstopped feedingthem. These eﬀortsto extractresourcesfrom agriculture byforcewere a disastrousblunderaswell asa crime. Atitsworst, agricul-tural outputdeclined byovera quartercompared with 1928, leav-ingthe plannerswith lessto redistribute to the urban workforce.Growth withoutgrotesqueryCould thisviolence and coercion be shorn from the Soviet ap-proach asNehruhoped? MrAllen believesso: “The collectivisa-tion ofagriculture wasnotnecessaryforrapid growth,” he ar-gues. Even Stalin eventuallyhad to relent, requisitioning lessgrain, legalisingprivate agricultural marketsand permitting indi-vidual ownership ofsmall plotsofland. Indeed, some economistsbelieve thatthe broad outlines ofthe Sovietapproach, minusthe atrocitiesand the autarky, bearsome resemblance to EastAsia’seconomicmodel. Paul Krug-man, an American economist, made thatcomparison in 1994, ar-guingthatthe growth ofthe Asian tigersresulted from rapid accu-mulation ofvariouskindsofcapital, and notfrom the moreeﬃcientuse ofthese resources. More recently, he has also arguedthatChina’shigh investmentcan be sustained onlybythe ﬂow ofsurplusworkersfrom overmanned farms. NowthatChina is“runningoutofpeasants”, he warns, investmentmaycollapse. MrCheremukhin and hisco-authorsare more optimistic. Ex-aminingboth China and the SovietUnion within the same ana-lytical framework, theyﬁnd notable diﬀerences. Mostof China’sgrowth from 1978 to 2012 wasbecause ofincreasesin non-agricul-tural productivity, theyﬁnd. And the migration oflabour fromﬁeld to factorywaslessimportantthan the migration of re-sourcesfrom state-owned enterprisesto private ﬁrms. China mayhave exhausted itssurpluspeasantry, butthescope forreformingand retrenchingitsstate-owned enterprisesremainsvast. The same istrue ofIndia. The Chhattisgarh steelplantsetup with Russian help in 1955 is, forexample, still going—partofIndia’sgiant, publiclyowned Steel AuthorityofIndia. Butitisnota greatadvertisementforthe Sovietapproach.

But, in an unex-pected turn ofevents, itisalso now appar-entthatthe human genome isnotthe onlyone to which attention should be paid. Hu-man gutscontain microbes, lotsofthem.Added together, the genesin these bugs’genomesamountto perhaps150 timesthenumberin the human genome alone. Ifthebacteria in question were doinglittle morethan swimmingaround digestinglettuce,thiswould be ofsmall consequence. Buttheyare doingmuch more than that. The membersofthe microbiome, asthiscommunityisknown, are, to a surpris-ingextent, partnersofhumanity. Andwhen thatpartnership goeswrong, the re-sultscan be dreadful. Inﬂammatoryboweldisease, autism, multiple sclerosis, obesity,diabetesand chronic-fatigue syndrome allseem to have linkswith dysbiosis, as animbalance in the microbiome isknown.Onlythismonth, there wasnewsthathu-man gutmicrobesinﬂuence the waypa-tientsrespond to a popularnewtype ofcancertreatmentcalled immunotherapy.Certain sortsofbacteria are abundant inpatientswho have been heavilytreatedwith antibiotics.

Butthe devicesthatlook atthe nitty-grittyofhownerve cellsthem-selvesworkare still Heath-Robinson af-fairs. These are the electrodesthatrecordthe impulsesofindividual cells, ideally si-multaneouslywith lotsofothers, in orderto tryto workouthownetworksofcellsprocessinformation.Thatmaychange with a device de-scribed thisweekin Nature. The businessend ofNeuropixels, asthe newtool isknown, isa probe made in the waythatcomputerchipsare made, byphoto-lithography. Thisprobe (see picture) is1cmlongand 70 micronsacross—aboutthewidth ofa human hair. Itiscapable of re-cordingsignalsfrom 384 nerve cellsatthesame time. These signalsare gathered indi-viduallybyelectrodes12 micronsacrossthatcoverthe probe’ssurface. The elec-trodesare made from titanium nitride, amaterial chosen because itisboth amena-ble to photolithographyand can surviveforatleastsixmonthsinside a brain.Each electrode recordsvoltage changesin the nerve cell nearestto itand transmitsthose changesto the top ofthe probethrough a conductive channel (one perelectrode) thatactslike a wire. There, thesignalsare picked up and deciphered by achip thatconvertsthe analogue electricalimpulsesfrom each ofthe 384 channelsinto digital bits, and then pushesthose bitsoutto a computerforanalysisthrough justfourwires. The whole set-up weighsamere 250mg. Thatmeansitcan be carriedaround withouttoo much trouble byan ex-perimental animal, such asa rat, while itismakingrecordingsofwhatisgoingon in-side the animal’sbrain.

In “The DescentofMan and Selection in Relation to Sex” hedevoted equal space to both the sorts ofsoundsthatemerge from birds’ beaksandthe more percussive noisesthattheymakewith otherpartsoftheirbodies, such astheirfeetand feathers. He speculated thatboth typesofsoundswere importantforsendingsignalsto others, butwasunsure ifthiswastrue. In the yearsthathave passedsince hisdeath, ornithologistshave provedtime and again thatbirds’ songs, squawksand shrieksare used forsendingsignals totheirkin, theirrivalsand sometimes eventheirpredators. In contrast, theirmore per-cussive soundshave received almostno at-tention atall. Astudypublished in CurrentBiologybyTrevorMurrayatthe AustralianNational University, in Canberra, how-ever, suggeststhatisa mistake. Atleast onebird createsa speciﬁc, audible warningwith the ﬂappingofitswings.The speciesin question isthe crested pi-geon. Although these birdsdo notproduceavocal alarm call, theirwingsare knownto emita whistle astheyﬂap. Researchpublished in 2009 showed thatcrested pi-geonsﬂeeingdangerﬂap theirwings faster,thusgeneratinga diﬀerentwhistle fromthatofbirdstakingoﬀin a more casualmanner. Italso showed thatthisdistinctivesound inducespigeonswhich hearitto ﬂeeaswell. Butthatresult, though interesting,leavesunclearwhetherthe whistle madewhen ﬂeeingismerelya side-eﬀectof rap-id departure, and thusa cue to others thatsomethingbad maybe happening, oris asignal thathasevolved speciﬁcallyto con-veyinformation aboutdanger. Areason to believe evolution isin-volved isthatone ofthe primaryfeathersofthe wingsofcrested pigeonsisan un-usual shape. The eighth primary(often,countingfrom the backto the frontof thewing) isnoticeablynarrowerthan itsneighbours. Itisalso narrowerthan theeighth primariesofall speciesclosely relat-ed to the crested pigeon. DrMurrayand hisassociatestheorised thatifthisodd-shaped primaryisresponsible forthe take-oﬀwhistle, then thatwould be strong evi-dence thatthe whistle isan evolved alarmsignal, and notan accidental cue. To testthisidea, theycollected 68 crest-ed pigeons. From some, theyremoved theoddlyshaped eighth primaries. From oth-ers, theytookthe ninth primaries. Andfrom othersstill theytookthe sevenths.The remainder, which acted ascontrols,had no feathersremoved. Each bird wasthen released and the sound ofitsdepar-ture recorded. Unsurprisingly, mostof theliberated birdsleftin a hurry, whistling astheywent.Analysisofthe whistlessuggested twofeatherswere involved. The eighth contrib-uted a high-pitched note and the ninth alow-pitched one. When the recordingsofthe departingbirdswere played to others,though, those within earshotﬂed only ifthe recorded bird still possessed its eighthprimaries. In otherwords, itisthe part ofthe whistle produced bythisodd-shapedfeatherwhich isthe ﬂightsignal—and, giv-en the feather’soddness, thatsound reallyisthe equivalentofan evolved alarm call.Darwin, himselfa noted pigeon fancier,would surelyhave been delighted.7Evolutionary biologySounds liketroubleAbird’s alarm calls do notalways comeoutofits beakNice primaries, dahlingMALCOLM X, an American political ac-tivist, described the media asthemostpowerful entityon Earth, “becausetheycontrol the mindsofthe masses”.Some journalistsmayﬁnd thispropositionﬂattering, butthough those who studysuch thingsagree newspapersexertsomeinﬂuence overtheirreaders, the eﬀect hasproved devilishlydiﬃcultto quantify.Now, GaryKingofHarvard Universityandhiscolleagueshave measured the impactofstoriesfrom almostthree dozen diﬀer-entnewssourceson the American public,asjudged bythe contentofpostson Twit-ter, a microbloggingservice.

These studies, however,ran into a common problem, namelydis-tinguishing(often small) eﬀectsthat arisebecause ofexposure to the media fromthose thatstem from innate diﬀerences be-tween the two groupsbeingstudied. Inmedical research, the tool forovercomingsuch problemsisthe randomised con-trolled trial.

After threeyearsofcajoling, 33 outletsrangingfromlong-established publicationslike the Na-tion, via upstartssuch asthe HuﬃngtonPost, to those intended forparticular audi-ences, like NewsTaco, agreed to partici-pate.

JacekKoziel ofIowa State Univer-sityreckonshe hasthe answer: titanium dioxide and disco lights.In the late 1960sresearchersatthe Uni-versityofTokyo discovered that, when giv-en a helpinghand byultravioletlight, tita-nium dioxide encouragesthe breakdownofall sortsoforganiccompounds. It doesso bycausingoxygen and watervapour incontactwith itssurface to reactand formmoleculescalled free radicals. These sub-stancesoxidise and destroyorganiccom-pounds, turningthem into small mole-culessuch ascarbon dioxide and water.Since the odourofexcrementiscomposedlargelyoforganiccompounds, and titani-um dioxide ischeap, DrKoziel wonderedwhetheritmightbe employed to de-pongbyres, sties, stables, shedsand other ani-mal dwellingplaces.In theirinitial experiments, he and histeam created a standardised manure-likestench from a mixture ofdimethyl disul-phide, dimethyl trisulphide, diethyl disul-phide, butyricacid, para-cresol and guai-acol. Thisisa combination thatisnot forthe faintofnose. Theythen coated the inte-riorsurface ofa glasscontainerwith a com-mercial preparation oftitanium dioxide,known asPURETi Clean, which containszillionsoftinycrystalsofthe chemical.These greatlyincrease the surface area ofti-tanium dioxide available forreactions tooccuron. Thatdone, the researcherspumped theirsmellygasinto the containerand activated the coatingusinga “blacklight”—a low-powered source ofultravioletsimilarto thatemployed in dance clubs toencourage customers’ clothesto ﬂuoresce.DrKoziel varied temperature, humidityand ventilation levelsin the container tomimicconditionsin both summerandwinter. In summer-like simulationsthedrop in odorantlevel was27-62%. In winterconditionsitwasup to 100%. Testsduringactual summer, on a pigfarm in Iowa, inwhich DrKoziel and hiscolleaguesdrewreal farm airthrough a black-lit, titanium-oxide-coated tunnel, cutoverall levels ofnoxiouschemicalsby16% and reduced oneofthe worst-smellingconstituentsof pigpong, para-cresol, by22%.

He ﬁred up Jewsand gentileswith a plan to unite Christen-dom and the tribesto free the holylandfrom the Ottoman Turks. The unlikelyem-issarywon an audience with a scepticalpope, who palmed him oﬀon the kingofPortugal, who nearlygave him eightwar-shipsand 4,000 gunsbefore abruptlychanginghismind. The kingaccused Da-vid ofconspiringwith Marranos(Jewswho had formallyconverted to Christian-ity) to Judaise Portugal. The storymoves onto Regensburgand a session with the HolyRoman Emperor, whom David mayhavetried to convertto Judaism. The document-arytrail then stops; the impostormay havebeen burned atthe stake.“Belonging” islessa historythan a por-traitgallery.

The modernisingforcesthatfreedJewsfrom old impedimentsalso provokedunease and anger. The railways, whichJewish bankershelped build, “rode overancient, noble boundariesoflanguage, ter-ritoryand nation”. The grand piano playedto largeraudiencesthan could earlier in-struments. Such spectaclesdebased musicwith Jewish commercialism, orso thoughtRichard Wagner. The houndingofAlfredDreyfus, a French armycaptain falsely con-victed ofbeinga German spy, sunderedFrance overa basicquestion ofnationalidentity: would modern states“be ground-ed in ethicsorethnicity”? The unhingedhatred directed atDreyfus“ruptured thefragile membrane ofcivility, and began tofoul the bodypoliticofthe modern age.”MrSchama’sstoryendswith TheodorHerzl’sresponse to thathatred, a plan tomove Europe’sJewsbeyond itsreach, toPalestine.

From these dual dimensionsofgriefand memory, one personal and one his-torical, Han Kang, a South Korean writer,hasfashioned a winterbookmade up ofbeautiful, tantalisingfragments.

StudentsofJewish jokeshave certainlyrevealed darksidesto Mrand MrsGoldberg, theirlong-suﬀeringrabbi and the implausiblyarticulatebeggarattheirdoor. Freud, forinstance,found thatthe humourofthe Jewswasespeciallyself-denigrating. Hisanalysiswasunscientiﬁc—the data setwasnoth-ingmore than hisown favourite jokes—buthisconclusion ringsatleasttrue-ish.Ruth Wisse, a Harvard professorofYid-dish, suggested in 2013 thattoo muchjokingmayin factbe bad forthe Jews.And, ofcourse, plentyofJewish humourhasbeen aboutunfunnytopicssuch aspogromsand the Holocaust.The ﬁrstchapterofa newstudybyJeremyDauber, a professoratColumbiaUniversity, looksatJewish comedyas aresponse to anti-Semitism and persecu-tion. Thischapterisreplete with tragedyand suﬀering, butMrDauberrecognisesthe multiplicityofJewish humourandwiselyresistsanysingle characterisationofit. Instead, he organiseshisbookaround seven themes, ofwhich the othersixare satire aimed atJewish norms;bookish and allusive wordplay; vulgarityand the body; mordantmetaphysicalirony; the folksyquotidian Jew; and theambiguousnature ofJewishness.The ﬁrstlaugh in Judaism, he argues,came in the BookofGenesis, when theaged Sarah ridiculed a prophecythat shewould beara son to the even more an-cientAbraham, and the joke turned outto be on her. MrDauberdeftlysurveysthe whole recorded historyofJewishhumour, buthisfocus—and evidently hispassion—isthe American light-entertain-mentindustryin the 20th centuryandtoday, ofwhich he givesan exhaustiveand sometimesexhaustingaccount.HenryFord’santi-Semiticnewspaper, theDearborn Independent, warned in 1921thatAmerica had “a movie problem”because ofJewish “control” ofthe ﬁlmbusiness.

Hothoused byhisfatherand preter-naturallyaccomplished, he sawthateven ifall his“objectsin life were realised”,still he would notbe content—and had anervousbreakdown. AsKieran Setiya ex-plainsin “Midlife”, two insightsspurredhisrecovery. One wasthathappinesswasto be found beyond himself: “Aimingthusatsomethingelse,” Mill saw, people “ﬁndhappinessbythe way.” The otherwasthatlife should involve more than the amelio-ration ofsuﬀering, noble asthatgoal was. ForMrSetiya, a philosopheratthe Mas-sachusettsInstitute ofTechnology, Mill ex-empliﬁesa syndrome thatislessan age-speciﬁcailmentthan a human predica-ment. At41, the authorishimselfaﬄictedby“a disconcertingmixture ofnostalgia,regret, claustrophobia, emptinessandfear”, beneath which lie “questionsoflossand regret, successand failure...mortalityand ﬁnitude”. The bedrockproblem is“theirreversibilityoftime”. AsMrSetiya says,“fastcarsand wild aﬀairs” cannotsalvethat, buthisbook—a delightful amalgam ofself-help and intellectual inquiry—aims toshowthatphilosophycan.Psychoanalysts, sociologistsand econ-omistsdiagnosed the midlife crisisfromthe 1960sonwards, butitstretchesbackthrough Dante’swood to antiquity. Its lin-eamentsare consistentand painfullyfa-miliar. “I lookbackwith envyatmyyoun-gerself,” MrSetiya writes. “He could beanything. ButI am condemned: course set,path ﬁxed, doorsclosed.” Aswell asexpe-riencinggrieffor“the thingsyoucouldhave done butneverdid and neverwill”,midlife meanslivingwith irreparable mis-takesand the bathosofachievement. Inone ofmanystrikingphrases, he reﬂectsthat“the future isa tunnel ofglass”—a tun-nel with onlyone terminus.Foreach neurosis, MrSetiya reasons outatherapy. Fearofhavingmissed outis, ineﬀect, a wish for“a profound impoverish-mentin the world”, or, asPlato putit, for“the life ofa mollusc”. “Embrace yourlosses,” he recommends, “asfairpaymentforthe surplusofbeingalive.” Lamentingmisstepsisnatural, butremember“every-thingin yoursubsequentlife thatﬂowedfrom them,” such as(ifyouhave them)yourchildren. Adiﬀerentlife might haveturned outworse; in anycase, no hypo-thetical alternative can outdo the one youhave, with all itsnuancesand richness,“like the fastidiousexcessofa peasantscene byBruegel”. MrSetiya anticipatesthe charge thatthese are high-classproblems. Theyarise,he insists, from the basicrealitiesof life,such asdeath—which, philosophicallyspeaking, “turnsoutto be a killer”. He con-sidersEpicurus’sconsolation (itisirratio-nal to worryaboutdeath while youarealive, and afteryoudie, youwon’tbe ableto) and Lucretius’s(death isno scarierthanthe time before yourbirth). He isunper-suaded, buttakessome heartfrom thethoughtthatcravingimmortalityislikewantingto be Superman, “a magical quali-tywhose absence itisperverse to mourn”.Ifall thissoundsgloomy, itisn’t. “Mi-dlife” combinesacuity, franknessand drol-leryin a style thatmeldsAristotle withKurtVonnegut. MrSetiya enlistsnotonlyphilosophersbutpoetsand novelists, suchasPhilip Larkin, Virginia Woolfand Rich-ard Ford. He celebratesReggie Perrin, pro-tagonistofan eccentricBritish sitcom, whofakeshisown death, then reconstitutes hisold life undera newname: exercising freewill while acknowledginghisblessings, hebecomes“an existential hero”. There areentertainingpen-portraitsofthinkers suchasSchopenhauerand Montaigne. MrSetiya’sultimate prescriptionsechothose ofMill: “ﬁnd meaningin the pro-cess,” whetherofworkorhobbies; learn tolive “in the halo ofthe present”. Even ifitdoesnotcure everymidlife crisis, his bookmaychange preconceptionsaboutthe dry-nessofphilosophy. Itwill make readersthinkand smile, which isnota bad therapyin itself. 7Middle ageOutofthe woodMidlife: A Philosophical Guide.By KieranSetiya.

ButCézanne also painted scoresofportraitsovera 50-yearcareer, and theytell a sur-prisingstory. Asan unprecedented new ex-hibition persuasivelyargues, itisthroughthislesser-known aspectofhisworkthatthe masterofAix-en-Provence found hisartisticvoice.“Cézanne’sPortraits” isthe ﬁrstexhibi-tion in more than a centuryto bringhis ma-jorportraitsunderone roof. Conceived bycuratorsin three countries, itwasa hitatthe Musée d’Orsayin Parisand opened inlate OctoberatLondon’sNational PortraitGallery. Itwill travel to the National Gal-leryin Washington, DCnextMarch. Notsince Vollard showed 24 Cézanne portraitsin 1910 have art-loversbeen able to see somanyofthese paintingsside byside. Whattheyreveal isCézanne’scontinuousex-perimentation, and even a reinvention ofthe verygenre ofthe portrait. Taken togeth-er, these paintingsofothersconstitute aportraitofthe man himself, and hisevolu-tion asan artist.Cézanne wasimmediatelyinterested inthe human ﬁgure when he started paintingin the 1860s. The earliestportraitsin theshoware offamilymembersand ofhim-self. Yetquicklyhispaintingsbegan to be-trayasmuch interestin materialsand formasin the depiction ofa particularperson. Aseriesofthick, heavilymodelled heads ofhisUncle Dominique setthe tone: theviewerwatchesthe painteratwork, at-temptingvariation upon variation. Theseenergeticworks, plastered with a paletteknife, are viscousand ﬂeshy, marking a ﬁrststep awayfrom the traditional idea of por-traiture, saysthe show’slead curator, JohnElderﬁeld. Although the formal, commis-sioned portraitreﬂectingsocial status wasno longerin vogue, the idea thata portraitshould reﬂecta psychological likeness re-mained current. Cézanne, with hisbold,ﬂatuse ofcolourreminiscentofEdouardManetand Gustave Courbet, called eventhisinto question.Afterthese “DeﬁantBeginnings”, astheexhibition termsthem, Cézanne spenttime with the Impressionists, lending hisnextportraitsa looserapproach, ﬂeckedwith light. Apaintingfrom 1877 ofHortenseFichet, hisloverand the motheroftheirson, wearinga striped skirt, standsout foritsdappled beautyand formal balance; herface iscomposed ofblocksofcolour.“There isnothingquite like thisin the pre-vioushistoryofportraiture,” MrElderﬁeldsays. Cézanne continuesinnovatingwithself-portraitsusingimpressionisticstrokesand dabs. Buthe isincreasinglyabsorbedbythe sculptural qualitiesofthe humanﬁgure, more interested in the volumes ofthe face than itsexpression. Bythemid-1880s, anyidea thata portraitshouldreﬂectthe mood orpersonalityofthe sitterisdecidedlydashed. Amongthe show’smostpowerful andunsettlingportraitsare those ofHortense,who became hiswife, and whom he paint-ed repeatedlyoverthe subsequentyears.The worksshockwith theirabsence ofemotion. Cézanne depictshiswife in a reddressasifshe isno more norlessthan abowl offruit: distant, geometric, rigid. Thisispreciselythe point. Cézanne’sgoal wasto paint“the objective presence ofsome-one—the vivid, rawpermanentpresenceofthe thingseen”, MrElderﬁeld hassaid.Fora decade the artisthad been paintingfruitand landscapesofsimilarheft. Inthese portraitshe liberatesthe ﬁgure fromthe dictate ofresemblance—eitherphysicalorpsychological—and stepsdecisively intothe modern.The two ﬁnal sectionsofthe exhibitionoﬀera joyousexplosion ofwhatmostviewerswill recognise asCézanne’sma-ture style—from hisfamousbathersto theviewsofL’Estaque and MontSainte-Vic-toire. In hislastdecade he painted peasantsnearhishome in southern France, alongwith chosen friends, usingpatchesofshimmeringcolourlike prismsto create asense ofdepth and volume. Aspectsof thissoftertouch and meldingofﬁgure andlandscape appearin peasantmodelsforhis“Card Players”, forexample. Delicaterainbowsare clearestin the facesof two ofhismostcontemplative portraits, those ofVollard and ofthe “Woman with a Café-tière”. The extraordinaryﬁnal portraits ofhisgardener, Vallier, in both darkinteriorand blazingsunlight, conﬁrm Cézanne’sultimate achievement. In thisnewart ofportraiture, there isindeed emotion—aris-ingnotfrom the subject’sface butfrom thepainter’sbrush. 7Cézanne’s portraitureThe emotional brushAmasteroflandscape and still life is revealed in his portraitsThe birth of the modernminishesthe dignityofan entire group.

Whateverthe answer, policymak-ersshould make decisionsfrom “behindthe veil ofignorance”: withoutknowingwhetheranyone person, includingthepolicymakersthemselves, would be awinnerorloserfrom a particularpolicy,which societywould theychoose?MrTirole appliesthistype ofreasoningto topicsrangingfrom carbon taxesto in-dustrial policy, from competition to thedigital economy. He presentseconomistsasdetectives, sniﬃngoutabuse ofmarketpowerand identifyingtrade-oﬀswherepopulistsmake emptypromises. Hisanal-ysisisladen with French examplesof ill-advised attemptsto defythe constraintsthatthose in hisdiscipline delightin point-ingout. When in 1996 the French govern-mentblocked newlarge storesin an eﬀortto restrain the powerofsupermarketchains, share pricesofexistingones rose.The newlawsinadvertentlyworsened theproblem byrestrictingcompetition.He also depictseconomistsasill-equipped to deal with the dirtyreality ofpolitics. To those who mightbe catapultedinto sudden stardom ashe was, he warnsthatacademiceconomistswill be quicklyputinto political pigeonholes, and their ar-gumentscelebrated ordismissed accord-ingto whetherthe recipientfavoursthat pi-geonhole. Though populistsrevel insimplicity, hisaim isto make economicscontext-speciﬁcand pointoutitscomplex-ities. Thisishisstrength, buthisdiscipline’slimitation.

Brit-ish Leyland, state-owned and subsidy-sod-den, produced underpowered rust-buck-ets—when itwasworkingatall. Attheheartofthe company’smisfortuneswerethe anarchicindustrial relationsatits big-gestplant, Longbridge in Birmingham,stoked byan unoﬃcial union leaderwhorevelled in the nickname “Red Robbo”. DerekRobinson wasindeed asred asred could be, takinga self-studyMarxismcourse asan apprentice toolmakerin histeens, joiningthe CommunistPartyin 1951,and standingfourtimesasa parliamentarycandidate. Afterreformersbooted him outin 1985 he co-founded a hardline successorparty, which still struggleson. The class-ridden incompetence ofBrit-ish post-warindustrial managementof-fered easypickingsforleft-wingers. Capi-talism looked asineﬃcientasitwas unfair:surelyworkersknewbestwho shouldmake what, howand where? Britain’smightymotorindustryhad an impregna-ble brand and marketshare, so the only im-mediate issue wasdividingthe spoils. In thatrespect, MrRobinson’sﬁeryso-cialistrhetoricmasked a keen businesssense. Workersshould sell theirlabour asproﬁtablyaspossible, he reckoned: for thebestpay, the leasteﬀortand with the great-estsecurity. Successmeanthard bargainingàla Trump, ignoringwiderconsiderationsand treatingall dealsastemporary.The resultwaschaos: in justtwo ofhisyearsasthe grassrootsunion leaderatLongbridge, he wasresponsible for523stoppages. The companywasan interna-tional joke: “British Lazyland”, the Ger-manscalled it, afternewsemerged of thenightshiftbringingsleeping-bagsto work.The archaicproduction lines, noisy, darkand dirty, were besetbydemarcation dis-putes. Halfa dozen unionszealouslyguarded theirprivileges. Woe betide theforeman who gota ﬁtterto change a fuse,ora toolmakerto adjusta nozzle.The tabloidsportrayed him asa wreck-er, which he disputed. “We didn’tcome outon strike justforthe sheerfun ofit,” he saidcrossly. MindlessmilitancywasforTrots-kyists, like the oneswho reigned attheCowleyplant, nearOxford. While capital-ism survived, jobsand wageswere the pri-orities, though he wanted successfor thecompanytoo. Itwould be an important po-litical victoryon the road to socialism, heargued, to prove that“ordinaryworkingpeople have gotthe intelligence and deter-mination to run industry”. AfterBritishLeyland’snationalisation in 1975, he brieﬂybacked newfangled workerparticipationin decision-making: “Itwould enable ustolookobjectivelyatsome ofthe changesthatwere required, outside ofbeingin abargainingposition,” he told Marxism To-day. Workersshould control newtechnol-ogy, notvice versa. While decryinghis pol-itics, thisnewspaperpraised him asa“responsible co-manager”. The experimentfailed. Union inputslowed and blunted hard decisions. Criticssaid he spentso much time meetingman-agementthathe losttouch with hismem-bers. Collaboration, he lamented, meant“responsibilitywithoutauthority”; in fu-ture, unionsshould have an outrightvetoon managementactions. The taxpayer, heargued, would stump up the investmentwhich the capitalistshad failed to provide,while importcontrolskeptoutpeskyfor-eign competition. Comrades, come rallyItneverhappened. Successsowed theseedsofdefeat, notrevolution. Union mili-tancyturned votersagainstthe Labourgovernment, bringingMargaretThatcher’sConservativesto powerin 1979 on a man-date ofcurbingstrikesand inﬂation. WhileBritain dozed and squabbled, foreign com-petitorshad munched marketshare. Theunreliabilityand obsolescence ofBritishLeyland’svehicleswere painfullyobvious.Arival even claimed cheekilythatits carswere made by“robotsnotRobbos”.MrRobinson’sforte washaranguingmassmeetingson windsweptplayingﬁelds, with strike votestaken instantly byan intimidatingshowofhands. Butin 1979British Leyland’snewboss, Michael Ed-wardes, balloted the workersdirectly (andsecretly) on modernisation plans, gainingaseven-to-one majorityfordrasticjob cutsin exchange forinvestment. MrRobinson seethed, buthisdays werenumbered. MI5, Britain’ssecurityservice,had inﬁltrated hisinnercircle, suborning aclose associate with ﬁsh and chips. Shock-inglybytoday’sstandards, MrEdwardeswasshown itssecretlyobtained account ofasubversive meetingbetween Commu-nistoﬃcialsand union activists(though infact, the D. Robinson attendingwasDerek’stwin brotherDennis, also a Communist).The companydemanded thatthe burlysix-footerdisown a pamphletcallingforstrikesagainstthe modernisation plan.When he refused, itﬁred him. Union bossesjoyfullysankthe issue ofhisdismissal in a bureaucraticswamp. Hu-miliatingly, the Longbridge workers—at amassmeeting, no less—refused to strike onhisbehalf. Freed ofitsunion shackles, themotorindustrythrived, though underfor-eign, mostlyJapanese, ownership. Britainnowproducesexcellentcars—and in great-ernumbersthan in MrRobinson’sheyday.Unemployable in industry, he turned toteachingtrade-union studies, yearning forthe tide to turn once more. 7All outDerekRobinson, a British trade unionist, died on October31st, aged 90ObituaryDerek RobinsonANGELINA’S  CAMBODIAN DRAMAWhen children change gender Couture’s Aussie upstartsEurope’s heart of darkness Fabergé’s potatoFilming in the Killing FieldsThe award-winning magazine of ideas, lifestyle and cultureeconomistsubscriptions.com/1843October/November issue on newsstands nowHuman labor refers to tuning, patching, updating, and maintenance of database.Copyright © 2017, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
