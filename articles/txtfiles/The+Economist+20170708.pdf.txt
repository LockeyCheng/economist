BusinessThe EconomistJuly8th20179THE battle-linesare drawn.When the world’sbigtrad-ingnationsconvene thisweek ataG20 summitin Hamburg, thestage issetfora clash between aprotectionistAmerica and afree-tradingGermany. PresidentDonald Trump hasalreadypulled outofone trade pact, the Trans-Paciﬁc Partner-ship, and demanded the renegotiation ofanother, the NorthAmerican Free-Trade Agreement. He isweighingwhether toimpose tariﬀson steel importsinto America, a move thatwould almostcertainlyprovoke retaliation. The threat ofatrade warhashungoverthe Trump presidencysince January.In contrast, Angela Merkel, Germany’schancellorand thesummit’shost, will bangthe drum forfree trade. In a thinlyveiled attackon MrTrump, she delivered a speech on June 29thcondemningthe forcesofprotectionism and isolationism. Animminentfree-trade deal between Japan and the EuropeanUnion will add substance to herrhetoric(see page 62). There isno question who hasthe betterofthisargument.MrTrump’sdoctrine thattrade mustbe balanced to be fair iseconomicallyilliterate. Hisbeliefthattariﬀswill level the play-ingﬁeld isnaive and dangerous: theywould shrinkprosperityforall. Butin one respect, atleast, MrTrump hasgrasped an in-convenienttruth. He hasadmonished Germanyforitstradesurplus, which stood atalmost$300bn lastyear, the world’slargest(China’shoard wasa mere $200bn). Histhreatened sol-ution—to puta stop to salesofGerman cars—maybe self-de-feating, butthe factisthatGermanysavestoo much andspendstoo little. And the size and persistence ofGermany’ssavingshoard makesitan awkward defenderoffree trade.ImperfectharmonyAtbottom, a trade surplusisan excessofnational saving overdomesticinvestment. In Germany’scase, thisisnotthe resultofa mercantilistgovernmentpolicy, assome foreigners com-plain. Nor, asGerman oﬃcialsoften insist, doesit reﬂectthe ur-gentneed foran ageingsocietyto save more. The rate ofhouse-hold savinghasbeen stable, ifhigh, foryears; the increase innational savinghascome from ﬁrmsand the government. UnderlyingGermany’ssurplusisa decades-old accord be-tween businessand unionsin favourofwage restraint to keepexportindustriescompetitive (see page 18). Such moderationserved Germany’sexport-led economywell through itspost-warrecoveryand beyond. Itisan instinctthathelps explainGermany’stransformation since the late 1990sfrom Europe’ssickman to today’smuscle-bound champion. There ismuch to envyin Germany’smodel. Harmonybe-tween ﬁrmsand workershasbeen one ofthe main reasons forthe economy’soutperformance. Firmscould investfree fromthe worrythatunionswould hold them to ransom. The stateplayed itspartbysponsoringa system ofvocational trainingthatisrightlyadmired. In America the prospectsfor men with-outcollege degreeshave worsened alongwith a decline inmanufacturingjobs—a cause ofthe economicnationalism es-poused byMrTrump. Germanyhasnotentirelyescaped this,butithasheld on to more ofthe sortsofblue-collar jobsthatAmerica grievesfor. Thisisone reason whythe populist AfDpartyremainson the fringesofGerman politics. Butthe adverse side-eﬀectsofthe model are increasinglyevident. Ithasleftthe German economyand global trade peril-ouslyunbalanced. Payrestraintmeanslessdomesticspendingand fewerimports. Consumerspendinghasdropped to just54% ofGDP, compared with 69% in America and 65% in Britain.Exportersdo notinvesttheirwindfall proﬁtsathome. AndGermanyisnotalone; Sweden, Switzerland, Denmarkand theNetherlandshave been pilingup bigsurpluses, too. Fora large economyatfull employmentto run a current-ac-countsurplusin excessof8% ofGDPputsunreasonable strainon the global tradingsystem. To oﬀsetsuch surpluses and sus-tain enough aggregate demand to keep people in work, the restofthe world mustborrowand spend with equal abandon. Insome countries, notablyItaly, Greece and Spain, persistent def-icitseventuallyled to crises. Theirsubsequentshift towardssurpluscame ata heavycost. The enduringsavingsglut innorthern Europe hasmade the adjustmentneedlesslypainful.In the high-inﬂation 1970sand 1980sGermany’spenchantforhigh savingwasa stabilisingforce. Nowitisa drag on globalgrowth and a targetforprotectionistssuch asMrTrump. The shiftfrom thriftCan the problem be ﬁxed? PerhapsGermany’sbumpertradesurpluswill be eroded asChina’swas, bya surge in wages. Un-employmentisbelow4% and the working-age population willshrink, despite strongimmigration. Afterdecadesofdecline,the costofhousingisrising, meaningthatpaydoesnot stretchasfarasitused to. The institutionsbehind wage restraintarelosinginﬂuence. The euro maysurge. Yetthe German instinctforcaution isdeeplyrooted. Payrose byjust2.3% lastyear,more slowlythan in the previoustwo years. Leftto adjust, thesurplusmighttake manyyearsto fall to a sensible level.The governmentshould help byspendingmore. Ger-many’sstructural budgetbalance hasgone from a deﬁcit ofover3% ofGDPin 2010 to a small surplus. Oﬃcialscall thispru-dence but, given high private-sectorsavings, itishard to de-fend. Germanyhasplentyofworthwhile projectsto spendmoneyon. Itsschool buildingsand roadsare crumbling, be-cause ofthe squeeze on publicinvestmentrequired to meetitsown misguided ﬁscal rules. The economylagsbehind in itsreadinessfordigitalisation, ranking25th in the world in aver-age download speeds. Greaterprovision ofafter-school carebythe state would letmore mothersworkfull-time, in an econ-omywhere women’sparticipation islow. Some saysuch ex-pansion isimpossible, because offull employment. Yet in amarketeconomy, there isa tried and trusted wayto bid forscarce resources: paymore. Above all, itislongpasttime forGermanyto recognise thatitsexcessive savingisa weakness. MrsMerkel isabsolutelyrightto proclaim the message offree trade. Butshe and hercompatriotsneed to understand thatGermany’ssurplusesarethemselvesa threatto free trade’slegitimacy. 7The German problemWhyGermany’s current-accountsurplus is bad forthe world economyLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistJuly8th20171THE deﬁnition ofan intercon-tinental ballisticmissile(ICBM) isone thatcan ﬂyat least5,500km (3,420 miles). Theweapon thatNorth Korea tested,with characteristicbelligerence,on the Fourth ofJuly, had a rangeofperhaps6,700km (see page21). So itsclaim to have builtan ICBMistechnicallycorrect.Thatisnotquite asalarmingasitsounds. Itallows Kim JongUn, North Korea’sdictator, to threaten Anchorage, Alaska, aswell asAmerica’sbaseson Guam and in Japan and South Ko-rea. ButLosAngelesand NewYorkare still outofreach. More-over, North Korea hasnotyetmastered the technology to pro-tecta nuclearwarhead asa missile re-entersthe atmosphere.And forthe North to achieve much longerrangesitwill have toadd a third stage to itstwo-stage missiles—a further technologi-cal leap. Nonetheless, MrKim’sdrive to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable ofstrikingAmerica isclearly advancingrapidly. Atbest, America mayhave a fewyearsbefore NorthKorea can rain destruction on itscities, asitso often threatens.Itwasnotsupposed to be thisway. When MrKim boastedofbeingclose to launchingan ICBM, on NewYear’sDay, Do-nald Trump retorted: “Itwon’thappen.” America tried to enlistChina, North Korea’smain tradingpartner, to persuade MrKim to desist. Fora fewmonthsChina made encouragingnoisesaboutcurbingthe ﬂowofgoodsacrossitsborder withthe North. ButMrTrump’sgrowingfriendship with Xi Jinping,hisChinese counterpart, seemsto have cooled (see page 27).MrTrump recentlyadmitted thatpressingChina into service“hasnotworked out”. Whatelse can he try? Despite lotsofmartial talkfrom MrTrump, a pre-emptivestrike againstNorth Korea isa terrifyingoption. It would risksettingoﬀa waron the Korean peninsula thatcould claim mil-lionsoflives. The lessincendiarystep oftryingto shootdownMrKim’smissileswheneverhe teststhem would prevent theNorth from developingan ICBM. ButAmerica maynotyethave perfected the anti-missile capabilitiesitneeds. MrTrump mightresortto directnegotiationswith NorthKorea—he once said thathe and MrKim could settle all theirdiﬀerencesovera burgeratthe White House. Butitis hard toimagine thatthe North would reallyabandon itsmissile pro-gramme, which itappearsto viewasitsone ironclad defenceagainsta hostile world. Meanwhile, the conﬁdence-buildingstep thatthe North demandsofAmerica—suspendingall mil-itaryexerciseswith South Korea—should be a non-starter. Theexercisesare legal whereasthe missile-testingisnot. AlsoNorth Korea hasa dire record ofcheatingon itscommitments;suspension would perturb America’sallies; and China, whichhatesdisplaysofAmerican mighton itsborders, would havean incentive to keep MrKim asa near-nuclearthreat.Sanctionsdo make life diﬃcultforthe North Korean re-gime. Butthe onlymeasure thatmighttrulythreaten it wouldbe to cutitsoil supply—and China hasalreadydeclined to dothat. America could punish more ﬁrmsin China thatabet tradewith North Korea (secondarysanctions, in the jargon). Butthebordertrade istoo ﬂuid and diﬀuse to haltthe determined MrKim, who caresnothingforhispeople’shardship.Ithelps ifpeople believe whatyou sayForall ofMrTrump’sbluster, he hasno good wayofstoppingNorth Korea from developingan eﬀective nuclearweapon. De-terrence and containmentremain the best(and possibly only)optionsto ensure thatMrKim isnevertempted to use hishorri-fyingarsenal. Butifdeterrence isto be eﬀective, America’sthreatsmustbe credible. So MrTrump muststop makingpromiseshe isnotreadyorable to honour—promiseslike stop-pingNorth Korea from developingan ICBM. 7North KoreaContainingMrKimAmerica cannotstop North Korea from building long-range nuclearmissiles. Butitcan deteritfrom using themINTHE go-go yearsbefore theﬁnancial crisis, banksgrewcarelessaboutdirtymoney.

Dozensofotherbankshave faced stiﬀpenalties.The crackdown wasmerited. Butsome ofitsresultshavebeen perverse. Bankshave pulled awayfrom clientsthey fearmightcommitﬁnancial crimesand therefore regard as toodangerousto serve. Manyhave done so indiscriminately (seepage 51). Money-transferﬁrms, especiallythose handling re-mittancesto poorcountries, and charitiesthatworkin conﬂictzones, have been hithard bythis“derisking”. So have banksinAfrica, eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean,which have been dropped bythe Western correspondentbankstheyrelied on to cleardollarand euro transactions.

Brandingan age categorymightsound like a frivolous exer-cise. Butlife stagesare primarilysocial constructs, and historyshowsthattheiremergence can triggerdeep changesin atti-tudes. Such change isneeded ifthe questionsthatswirlaround risinglongevityare to geta ﬁttinganswer.End ofGeneration zzzBefore 1800 no countryin the world had an average life expec-tancyatbirth beyond 40. Todaythere isnota countrythat doesnot. Since 1900, more yearshave been added to human lifethan in the restofhistorycombined, initiallybyreducing childmortalityand latelybystretchinglifespans. Longevity isone ofhumanity’sgreataccomplishments. Yetitisseen asone ofsociety’sgreatheadaches. The pro-blem liesin the increasingdependencyofthe old on theyoung. By2100, the ratio of65-plussersto “working-age” peo-ple will triple. Asthe world greys, growth, taxrevenues andworkforceswill decline while spendingon pensionsandhealth care will increase. So, atleast, goesthe orthodoxy. Doom-mongerstend to missa biggerpoint, however. Thoseextra yearsoflife are predominantlyhealthyones. Five oftheadditional sixyearsthata British boyborn in 2015 can expecttolive, compared with one born in 1990, will be healthy, accord-ingto the Institute forHealth Metricsand Evaluation, attheUniversityofWashington. Too manygovernmentsand ﬁrmsfail to recognise thisfact, instead lumpingall the extra yearsinthe damningcategoryof65 and over. Thisbinarywayofthink-ing, seeingretirementasa cliﬀedge overwhich workers andconsumerssuddenlytumble, bearslittle relation to the realworld. Italso encouragesunimaginative policy, whereby theretirementage isoccasionallymoved aslifespanslengthen.Amore radical approach would startbyacknowledgingthat, in the rich world atleast, manyofthe old are still young.Asthisweek’sspecial reportargues, theywantto work, butmore ﬂexibly.

In western Eu-rope the over-60swill accountfor59% ofconsumption growthin citiesbetween nowand 2030, saysMcKinsey, a consultancy.Declaringa newstage oflife could help change perceptions.Ithasdone so before. Today’sconception ofchildhoodemerged in the 19th century, pavingthe wayforchild-protec-tion lawsand a golden age ofchildren’sliterature. Spotty, awk-ward 15-year-oldspredated the 1940s, butonlythen did mysti-ﬁed adultscoin the label “teenagers”, fuellingall sortsofproductsand services, from bobbysocksto the musicindustry.In 1944 Lifewrote that“American businessmen, manyofwhom have teen-age daughters, have onlyrecentlybegun torealise thatteen-agersmake up a bigand special market.” Bythe mid-1960sboth Timeand Newsweekhad splashed “TheTeen-Agers” on theircovers.Markingoutyouthful old age asa distinctphase of lifemighthave a similareﬀect, proddingemployersand policy-makersto thinkdiﬀerentlyabouthowto keep the young oldactive. Aslife becomeslonger, the word “retirement”, whichliterallymeanswithdrawal to a place ofseclusion, has becomemisleading. At65 youare notclapped out, butpre-tired.

Butthree yearsafterAbuBakral-Baghdadi as-cended the pulpitofthe Nurimosque in Mosul to call on allMuslimsto ﬂockto his“caliph-ate”, IslamicState (IS) issuﬀeringtwo crushingblows. In Iraq, thejihadistshave all butlostMosul; theyblewup the Nurimosque in theirlaststand in a pocketofalleyways(see page39). MrBaghdadi, ifhe isalive, mayhave ﬂed to Syria. ButISisfaringbadlythere, too. American-backed ﬁghtershave pushedinto the old cityofRaqqa; IS’sSyrian stronghold will fall soon. With the lossofitsbiggestcities, the mystique of the jihadist“state” isbeingshattered. ISisturninginto a nastymilitia, andmayyetbecome a nebulousterroristgroup, like al-Qaeda. Theworld should rejoice atitsdecline. IScommitted untold bar-barity, from massbeheadingsto sexual enslavement, and in-spired jihadiststo kill the innocentin Europe and elsewhere.America hasled the campaign ably, givingtrainingand airsup-port, while lettinglocal alliesdo the ground ﬁghting.Butwhatwill come afterthe caliphate? No one knows, leastofall Donald Trump. He hasyetto ﬁll nearly200 foreign andnational-securityjobs, and policymakingin hisadministra-tion isdysfunctional. Thatisalarming. Adrift, America facestwo perils: one isa vacuum thatallowsjihadiststo regroup, astheydid repeatedlyin Iraq; the otherisbeingsucked into a re-gional warthatwould make everythingworse.Conﬂict, wrapped in strife, inside a warThe bloodbath in the Middle Eastconsistsofmanyconﬂicts:revoltsagainstoppressive rulerswho failed to earn legitimacyorfosterprosperity; strugglesovercompetingformsof Islam;regional contestsbetween Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey; andrivalrybetween America and Russia. AtitsheartisSunni Ar-abs’ sense ofdispossession, ofwhich ISisthe mostgrotesquemanifestation. So America needsa strategywith manydimen-sions, blendingmilitary, political and economicmeans, andtakingaccountofthe complexgeopoliticsthatfeedschaos.There isno sign thatMrTrump’sadministration isengagedin such thinking. On hisﬁrsttrip abroad, to Saudi Arabia, hewasfeted byArab and Muslim leaders, and regaled with juicydefence contracts. In return, he seemed to embrace the Saudiworldview—and thusprecipitated a crisisamongAmerica’sGulfallies. Emboldened, the Saudisand Emiratis(along withthe Egyptiansand Bahrainis) cutoﬀland, sea and air linkswithQatar. Theyaccuse the upstartgas-rich kingdom, which hostsAmerica’sbiggestairbase in the region, ofsupporting terro-rism (a charge often levelled atthe Saudis). MrTrump de-nounced Qataron Twitter. ButRexTillerson, America’ssecre-taryofstate, instead chastised the boycotters; James Mattis, thedefence secretary, signed a deal to sell F-15 jetsto Qatar, andsenttwo warshipsto call atDoha. Amid such incoherence, astrategymayfail, even ifone existed.MrTrump seemsto have three vague aims: destroyIS, rollbackIran’sgrowingpowerand reduce America’sinvolvementin the Middle East. These are inconsistent, because sustaineddiplomaticand militaryengagementwill be needed both topreventa newIS risingfrom the ashesofthe old and also tocontain Iran, which isusingitsproxiesand itsown forces dot-ted around the region to extend itsinﬂuence. Startwith IS. To lockin itsvictoriesagainstthe jihadists,America mustbackpluralistand decentralised politics (don’tcall itdemocracy) thatgivesvoice to the region’sdisparategroups, especiallySunni Arabs. In Iraq, America must urge thegovernmentto woo Sunnisand to include them in running thecountry; and itshould use itsairpower, special forces and dip-lomatsasa counterweightto Iran. Syria will be even harder. The end ofthe civil war isa longwayoﬀ. MrTillerson hasputoutfeelersto Russia about co-op-eratingto stabilise the country, butwhathe wantsis unclear.Fornow, America can help local alliespush down the Euphra-tesvalley, notjustto defeatthe remnantsofISbutalso to en-sure thatbordercrossingsare in friendlyhands. That wouldalso secure an American voice in future peace talks. Thiswill mean redoublingthe eﬀortto train more moderateSunni Arabs. The alliance led byKurdsisunlikelyto wantto gobeyond Raqqa. The prioritywill thusbe to fostera southernArab force to ﬁghtand drawawaysupportfrom IS. Inevitably, thatwill bringAmerica into furthercontact withIran. America’sforcesand theiralliesare alreadyrubbingagainstSyriansand otherspushingeastward, seekingto linkup with Iranian-backed Shia militiasin Iraq and create a landcorridorfrom Iran to Lebanon. America shotdown a Syrian jetand bombed Iranian-backed ﬁghtersthatthreatened Ameri-can and allied forcesatal-Tanf, nearthe southern border withJordan and Iraq. Asifthatwere notcomplexenough, MrTrump saysthatIran “hasbeen puton notice”, although he hasfornowkeptto BarackObama’sdeal thatfroze Iran’snuclearprogramme. Asthe administration debatesa newIran policy,there ismuch talkoffresh sanctions, with some arguing for“coerced democratisation”: ie, topplingthe mullahs. America could thusend up atwarwith Iran bymilitary ac-cident, orbybeinggoaded into itbyGulfalliesorbecause itsuccumbsagain to the delusion thatoverthrowingfoes iseasyand painless. Aconﬂictwith Iran isunlikelyto unseat the cler-ics; butitwill undoubtedlyspread instabilityand Shia radical-ism. Iran istoo bigto be excluded from the region’saﬀairs; but itcan be contained bya mixture ofpressure and dialogue. Amer-ica should therefore workto end the rowamongitsGulf allies,which beneﬁtsIran, justasitshould actto haltthe warin Ye-men, which createsspace foral-Qaeda.American power, vital butlimitedWhateverAmerica doeswill be messy, and itsaimsought to belimited. The warsin Afghanistan and Iraq afterthe 9/11attacksshowthatitisgood atdefeatingfoesbutpooratbuilding last-inginstitutions; grand plansto remake countriesare usuallydoomed. Yetthe collapse ofSyria and the rise ofISsince 2011showthatneglectposesgrave dangers, too. America has nochoice butto contain the worstofthe tumult.

In “Faust”, hismasterpiece, anindebted emperorispersuaded bythe dev-il to print“phantom money”, pricesriseand economicdisasterlooms. Foreign in-terlocutorsmightcounterwith a quote oftheirown from the greatpoet. “The Ger-mans”, he said, “make everythingdiﬃcult,both forthemselvesand everyone else.” Formanyyears“everyone else” hascomplained thatGermany’seconomycausesdiﬃcultiesforthe restofthe world.Theygrumble thatthe countrysavestoomuch and spendstoo little and thatGer-manyexportsfarmore goodsthan itim-ports. In mostyearssince 1950, Germanyhasrun a surpluson itscurrentaccount, abroad measure ofthe balance oftrade (seechart1). When in surplus, domesticsavingsexceed domesticinvestments, with the ex-cesslentabroad.These surplusesmean othercountriesmustrun current-accountdeﬁcits(in otherwords, borrow) in orderto ensure there isenough aggregate demand to keep peoplein work. Lastyear, Germany’ssurpluswasamammoth 8.3% ofGDP. Atalmost$300bn thatisfarlargerthan China’ssur-plus, which wasonce a targetofangryAmerican congressmen. NowGermanyisaccused ofpiggybackingon othercoun-tries’ spendingand ofexportingjob losses.Donald Trump hascastigated Germany’ssurplusas“verybad” and bemoaned thenumberofGerman carssold in Ameri-ca—“we will stop this”. Within the euroclub, the gripe isthatGermany, asthe mostcreditworthymember, hasinsisted on aus-terityforcountrieswith heavydebts, with-outrecognisingthatitsown tightrein onspendingmakesthatadjustmentharder. YetGermany’seconomyisalso ad-mired. The unemploymentrate hasfallento 3.9%, lowerthan almostall rich coun-tries. The economywasbrutallyside-swiped bythe “GreatRecession” of2008-09 butemploymentwasbarelyaf-fected, in starkcontrastwith othercoun-tries. The political shocksofthe past yearin Britain and America are linked to thesteadylossofwell-paid blue-collarjobs toautomation and to cheaperimports, nota-blyfrom China. Germanyhasbucked thistrend. The share ofmanufacturingjobs hasnotfallen anythinglike asfar(see chart 2on nextpage). Othercountries, notablyFrance, are again hopingto emulate Ger-many’ssystem ofapprenticeships, bywhich those notsuited foruniversity caninstead acquire vocational skills.Germansare proud ofthisrecord. Theidea thatthe country’strade surplusisamalignancyisdismissed in policycircles.“Itwould be a worryifitisdown to an eco-nomic-policydistortion,” saysan oﬃcial.“Butit’snot.” Itsthriftisdefended as right-ful prudence. The countryneedsto savehard, the argumentruns, because itis age-ingfasterthan othercountries. Notevery-one seesitthatway. The IMF countersthatGermany’strade surplusesare biggerthancan be justiﬁed orthan isdesirable forglo-bal economicstability. The dialogue con-tinues, atcross-purposes, justasit hasfordecades. “Whatdo youwantusto do—ex-portless?” saysanotheroﬃcial, weary ofthe same debate.Whatmakesthe issue so diﬃcult to re-solve, oreven to acknowledge, isthat Ger-many’ssavingssurplusesare notthe out-come ofexpliciteconomicpolicy.

Unemploymentwasabove 4m, atenth ofthe workforce. Germany’sshare ofmerchandise exportswasshrinking. Thecurrentaccountwasin a rare deﬁcit. Theeconomy’sstruggleswere in parta legacyofdevaluationsagainstthe Deutschmarkearlierin the decade, when speculatorsbroke the boundsofEurope’sexchange-rate mechanism, a system thatlimited cur-rencyﬂuctuations. The ordersand jobs lostto Italy’scapital-goodsindustryin the1990sare partofGerman businessfolklore.The funkalso reﬂected overgenerouswage rises, especiallyin EastGermany,afterreuniﬁcation in 1990. Crisesin Asiaand Russia, two bigexportmarketsfor Ger-many, did nothelp matters, butthe pro-blemsran deeper. Itbecame routine to re-ferto Germanyasthe “sickman ofEurope”. Yetremarkably, justasthingsseemed hopeless, an old reﬂexbegan tokickin. When the Bretton Woodssystem ofﬁxed exchange ratescollapsed in the 1970s,the Deutschmarksoared, makingGer-many’sexportsmore expensive. Germanindustrythen found a wayto regain com-petitiveness. Nowitdid so again. Competing valuesGerman ﬁrmsslowlybegan to clawbackthe exportcompetitivenesstheyhad lost inthe reuniﬁcation boom. An importantgauge ofthisisa country’srelative unit la-bourcosts, which shiftsdownwardsaswagesfall, productivityrelative to othercountriesimprovesorthe currencyweak-ens. The indexforGermanyfell by16% be-tween 1999 and 2007 (see chart3), largelybecause ofwage restraint.Paygrowth wasa modest1% a yearbe-tween 2000 and 2007, compared with anOECD average of3.5%. Whatmade thispos-sible, accordingto a studybyChristianDustmann ofUniversityCollege London,and hisco-authors, wasa deeply-rootedsystem ofco-operative industrial relations.An importantfeature ofthe system is thatunionshave representativeson companyboards: theycan see atﬁrsthand how payrisesmayhurtcompetitiveness. Fortheirpart, ﬁrmssee negotiationson payas ameansto pursue otherareasofcommoninterest, such astrainingorﬂexible hours. Good labourrelations, governed bynormsratherthan legislation, meantﬁrmswere ﬂexible enough to adaptto newchal-lenges. One such wasthe accession to theEU oflow-costneighbours, including Po-land, Hungaryand the Czech Republic.Anotherwasthe emergence ofChina as anexporterofglobal signiﬁcance. Bythe late1990s, ﬁrmsand unionshad alreadystart-ed to move awayfrom a system ofindus-try-wide wage dealsto one where paywassetto suitthe challengesfaced byindivid-ual companies.Aconsequence ofthe greaterrelianceon company-level paydealswasa growingdispersion in wages: those forthe best-paid workersrose fasterthan averagewhile wagesatthe bottom ofthe scale fellsharply. The fallingcostto manufacturersoflocal services, where paywasmost con-strained, played a bigrole in Germany’sex-portrevival. Thiswasnotthe whole story. In 2002Gerhard Schröder, the leaderofthe SPDgovernment, asked a commission, chairedbyPeterHartz, an executive atVolkswagen,and includingcompanybossesand unionchiefs, fora blueprintto tackle unemploy-ment, which wasstill rising. The proposals,which became partofa broaderpackage ofreforms, known asAgenda 2010, were im-plemented in fourstages. The ﬁnal leg,HartzIV, came into eﬀectin January 2005.Itcontroversiallyrestricted beneﬁts forthelong-term joblessto a ﬂatrate, irrespectiveofpreviousearnings. To qualifyforbene-ﬁts, the joblesshad to showtheywere ac-tivelylookingforwork.The Hartzreformsshould take atleastasmuch creditaspayrestraintforthe jobsrecovery, saysMichael Burda ofthe Hum-boldtUniversityin Berlin. The reforms arestill celebrated bythe Mittelstand, Ger-many’smuch-admired legion ofmedium-sized, mostlyfamily-owned ﬁrms. “Thejourneyfrom sickman to number-oneeconomyisbecause ofSchröder’sAgenda2010,” saysMario Ohoven, head ofBVMW,the Mittelstand association. Butthe suc-cesscame with a political cost. The SPD lostblue-collarsupportand hasnotled a gov-ernmentsince. The culture ofco-operation cutsbothways. When the GreatRecession struck,ﬁrmsin otherrich countrieslaid oﬀ work-ers. In Germany, companiesheld on tostaﬀdespite a slump in ordersand output.In thistheywere aided bythe widespreadadoption ofworking-time accounts, ﬁrstused in the 1990s. Workerscould bankovertime hoursto take aspaid holiday atalaterdate. Short-time workingschemesalso helped to limitthe damage to jobs. Butthe response bythe Mittelstand wasa re-ﬂection ofa system ofconventionsthatstandard economicsignores, saysDennisSnowerofthe Kiel Institute forthe WorldEconomy.

Indeed itis theshare ofconsumerspendingthatlooks un-dulylow.PeterBoﬁnger, one ofthe GermanCouncil ofEconomicExperts, which ad-visesthe government, believesthere is asimplerexplanation forthe surpluses. “It’sall aboutwages,” he says. Payrestraint isnotjusta problem forGerman workers,particularlythe low-paid. Othereuro-areacountriesmustkeep an even tighterlid onwage growth to clawbacktheircompeti-tiveness. Thatimpartsa deﬂationary biasthroughoutthe zone: almostall euro-areacountriesnowrun current-accountsur-pluses. Itisin large partwhyinﬂation in theblochasfallen shortofthe ECB’starget.Asurge in German wagesmightbegood forall sortsofreasons. Butcan ithap-pen? German payratesare subjectto twoinﬂuences: the bargaininginstitutions andthe economicfundamentals, saysHenrikEnderlein ofthe Hertie School ofGover-nance in Berlin. The institutionsare setupforwage restraint: employerswantit; un-ionswill trade itforjob security. But eco-nomicspushesagainstall this.Itisnotjustthat, with unemploymentbelow4%, the jobsmarketistight. The in-digenousworkingpopulation islikely toshrinkfasterthan the rate ofimmigration.Forthe ﬁrsttime in decades, ﬁrmsare fac-inga scarcityofworkers.

Thisisthe ﬁrst boomthatthe Bundesbankcannotsnuﬀout, saysMrEnderlein. The habitofwage restraintamongunion bossesisingrained buttheirinﬂuence issteadilyeroding. Union mem-bership hasshrunkfrom 35% ofworkersin1990 to 18% in 2013, even ifmore than halfofthe workforce isstill covered byunion-brokered wage deals.

Although the claim istechnicallycorrect, the country’sleader, Kim JongUn,will probablyhave to waita fewmoreyearsbefore he can brandish a missile ca-pable ofdeliveringa nuclearwarhead toLosAngelesorNewYork. The missile appearsto have ﬂown for37minutesbefore splashingdown some930km from itslaunch. Accordingto DavidWrightofthe Union ofConcerned Scien-tists, ithad a lofted (heightened) trajectory,reachingan altitude of2,800km. On amore conventional trajectory, the samemissile would have a range ofabout6,700km. Thatwould be enough to reachAlaska, butnotHawaii orCalifornia.Thistestcomesaftera similarone onMay14th; the missile used then, also on alofted trajectory, wasthoughtto have a po-tential range of4,500km. John Schillingofthe website “38 North” believesthatmis-sile to have been a scaled-down, two-stageversion ofthe three-stage KN-08 prototypeICBM. The smallermissile, which theNorth Koreanscalled the Hwasong-12 andwhich Western intelligence analystshaveThatisunlikely. MrTrump hasbeenforced to admitthathisearlierhopes ofget-tingChina to rein in North Korea have goneunfulﬁlled.MrTrump seemsalso to bemore aware than before thatmilitaryop-tions, while still “on the table” accordingtoMike Pence, the vice-president, are verymuch a lastresort. Hisdefence secretary,JamesMattis, recentlysaid thatoutrightwarwith North Korea would be “cata-strophic” and “probablythe worstkind ofﬁghtingin mostpeople’slifetimes”. In a meetingin Washington lastweekwith South Korea’snewpresident, MoonJae-in, MrTrump emphasised thathe wasopen to dialogue with North Korea “underthe rightcircumstances”. Butthere seemsscantprospectofthat, given the zeal withwhich MrKim ispursuinghismissile pro-gramme. Even a newraftof“secondary”sanctionsaimed atChinese ﬁrmsandbanksthatdo businesswith North Koreawould be unlikelyto exertsuﬃcient pres-sure on MrKim to bringhim to the negoti-atingtable, while antagonisingChina.Fighting ballistics with ballisticsOne remainingpossibility, albeita riskyone, isthatAmerica mightthreaten toshootdown North Korean missilesin theirboostorascentphase. IfNorth Korea can-nottest, itcannotbuild a reliable ICBM. Todo this, saysMichael Elleman ofthe Inter-national Institute forStrategicStudies, athink-tank, America and Japan wouldhave to deploya newgeneration ofinter-ceptors, which are 50% fasterthan the cur-rentones, on theirAegis-classdestroyers.Butfollowingthe failure ofa testﬁring inJune, theyare still some wayfrom enteringservice. Given the speed atwhich NorthKorea’smissile programme isadvancing,itsICBMsmaybe readybefore America’snewinterceptorsare. 7tentativelydesignated asthe KN-17, wasdisplayed duringa militaryparade onApril 15th.Afterthe launch on May14th, MrSchil-lingspeculated thatthe Hwasong-12 wasbeingused to develop the technologiesand systemsneeded forfuture ICBMs. Thiswould be cheaperand lessprovocativethan testingthe KN-08.The North Koreans, in an announce-mentseveral hoursafterthe July4thlaunch, dubbed the latestmissile the Hwa-song-14, which indicatesthatitmaybe amore powerful version ofthe Hwasong-12.The test, aswell asdemonstratinggreaterrange, could have been designed to gainadditional knowledge ofthe engineeringrequirementsfora warhead-carryingre-entryvehicle byﬂyingforlongerand athigheraltitude.

Forsixmonthsit con-sulted indigenouspeople around Austra-lia, culminatingin a “FirstNationsNation-al Constitutional Convention” atUluru(AyersRock), in central Australia in lateMay.

This finding reflects the importance IT plays in business strategy as innovative technologies from analytics to machine learning reshape the competitive playing field. These technologies can increase agility, enhance produc-tivity, and substantially improve processes. But while many executives understand these benefits, the path to adopting the technologies can be daunting.Mike Nefkens, executive vice president and general manager of regions and industries for DXC Technology, a global IT services and solutions leader, knows well the challenges companies face. “Most enter- prises need to execute quickly at extreme scale, and they must innovate globally while keeping their infra-structure secure,” he says. “Technology service providers can create a new digital  platform that frees up organizations to focus on differ- entiated services instead of traditional IT plumbing.”An external technology partner can also add a critical aspect to the digital journey. “Companies must engage differently—with cloud providers, service integrators, and other ecosystem participants,” says Dan Hushon, senior vice president and chief technology officer at DXC. Why all this collaboration? Because digital is about much more than just learning or implementing a technology—it’s a vast cultural change in the way we work. A complete digital transformation involves empowering employees, optimizing business processes, and reimagining how employees work with clients and collaborate internally. “True digital transformation is about bringing information into the fabric of every transaction with a client, employee, partner and process,” Hushon says.But a complete transition to digital can’t happen overnight. “For at least the next five years, it will be a hybrid world. Since many applications are too costly and risky for comp-anies to tackle all at once, companies will have one foot in the traditional world and one in the digital world,” Nefkens says. “But once companies replace archaic infrastructures and applications with modern, next-generation IT solutions, they will be able to move faster, stay a step ahead of their competitors, get to customers first, and create new growth. That’s the definition of a successful digital transformation.”ADVERTISEMENTThe future of business: How DXC Technology is leading digital  transformationMike Nefkens Executive Vice President and  General Manager of Regions  and Industries, DXC TechnologyDan Hushon Senior Vice President and  Chief Technology Officer, DXC TechnologyTechnology service providers  can create a new digital platform that frees up organizations to focus on differentiated services instead of traditional IT plumbing.Mike NefkensDan HushonWE ARE DXC TECHNOLOGY.Introducing an innovative new company with the clout and experience of a global leader.

The festival iscontentiousin China, too.Thousandsofpeople protestonlineagainstthe festival and demand thatdogmeatbe made illegal, asithasbeen in Tai-wan—in April the island became the ﬁrstAsian countryto ban eatingortrading themeatofdogsand cats. Dog-meatsellers inYulin respond thateatingdogsisno diﬀer-entfrom killingand consuminganyotherdomesticanimal. Yulin’sgovernmentshuttlesbackand forth between compet-ingviews. Rumoursﬂewthatthisyear itwould close down the festival. In the end,itdid not. State media quoted local oﬃcialsassayingtheyhad issued no such order.In traditional rural China, dogswereguardiansorherders, notso often food. Inthe biggestcities, petownership issoaring,asisconcern foranimal welfare. But in theswathesofChina thatare neithertradition-al normodern, where regulationsare elas-ticand crime iscommon, the dog-meatmarketisthriving. Itisa case study in un-ﬁnished modernisation. Dogmeatisnottaboo in China, as itis inmostWestern countries. But, saysGuoPengofShandongUniversity, eatingdogshasalwaysbeen uncommon, exceptinpartsofthe south and amongthe ethnicKorean minority, who number2.3m andmostlylive in the north-east. ManyChi-nese, she says, regard dogmeatasa kind ofmedicine thatcan regulate the heatof thebody. Buttheydo nottreatitasa mainsource ofprotein. Thisviewisconsistentwith a surveyin 2016 byDatawayHorizon,apollingﬁrm, fora Chinese NGO, CapitalAnimal Welfare Association. Itfound thatabout70% ofChinese people said theyhadnevereaten dog. Ofthose who said theyhad, mostclaimed itwasnotbyactivechoice, butbecause the meathad beenserved to them on a social occasion.Overthe pasttwo decades, however,dogmeat, like drugs, hasbecome a sourceofcriminal income, accordingto MsGuo.Sellersin Yulin and elsewhere saytheirmeatcomesfrom dogfarms. Butwhen ani-mal-welfare groupshave tried to inspectsuch farms, theyhave usuallybeen unableto ﬁnd any. In late June activistsinterceptedalorrycarrying1,300 dogs, apparentlydes-tined forsale asmeatin Yulin (one of therescued animalsispictured). Theysuspectmanywere stolen pets.MsGuo hascarried outrare researchinto the dog-meatmarket, focusingon thecoastal province ofShandong. Mostof themeat, she found, came from criminalswhowere goingfrom village to village, usingcrossbowsto shootdogswith poisoneddarts. Some ofthe hunterswere equippedwith infrared sights. The meatbecame con-taminated bythe poison, butsince thebusinesswasunregulated, thisdid notmatterto the dealers. Between 2007 and2011a third ofthe dogsin one village, Yao-jia, were stolen.

The combination ofnon-existentregu-lation and consumer-friendlypriceshashelped to create a farlargerdog-meat mar-ketthan everexisted in the past. The Yulinfestival reﬂectsthisrecentdevelopment.Though itssupporterscall ita traditionalevent, the ﬁrstfestival tookplace in 2009. RicherpartsofChina, meanwhile, areadoptingmore Western attitudes. In Bei-jingthere hasbeen a bigincrease in dogownership. Dog-loverssometimesclashwith huntersand meat-sellers. In Mao’sday, dogownership bycitydwellerswascondemned asa “symbol ofdecadence” and strayswere shoton sight.In the capital dogswere banned until 1994and strictlylicensed until 2003. Since then,arelaxation ofthe ruleshasallowed own-ership to growby25% a year, bringingthetotal numberofregistered dogsto morethan 2m in 2016, saysthe PublicSecurityBureau, which issuesdog-keepingpermits.Accordingto MaryPengofthe Internation-al Centre forVeterinaryServices, a charity,only50-60% ofdogsin the cityand 30% ofthose in suburbsare licensed. So, she reck-ons, there maybe 4m-6m dogsin Beijing,more than ﬁve timesasmanyasin LondonorNewYork. Regulationsare still onerous. In the in-nercityofBeijinga doglicence costs 500yuan a year—almostten timesasmuch asin NewYork. The price includesa rabiesshotbutisstill considered steep. Manyownersrefuse to registertheirhounds,leadingto worriesaboutdisease. Accord-ingto the World Health Organisation, Chi-na hasthe world’ssecond-highestdeathtoll from rabiesafterIndia—around 2,000-3,000 humanfatalitiesa year. In an at-temptto reduce dognumbersand unregis-tered animals, the capital hasjoined someotherChinese citiesin adoptinga one-dogpolicy: onlya single pooch maybe regis-tered perhousehold. Activistsfrom Beijinghave caused traf-ﬁcjamsbystoppinglorriescarrying dogsto slaughterhouses. LastNovember, theypersuaded China’slargestfood-deliverycompanyto stop carryingdog-meatmeals.In MayZhangXiaohai ofAITA, China’sﬁrstregistered animal-welfare organisa-tion, wentto Yulin to tryto encourage localopposition to the festival. He said oﬃcialstold him thattheyknewthe eventwasharmingthe city’sreputation and contrib-utingto the spread ofrabies, butwere re-luctantto ban it. (The local governmentsaysitisnotinvolved in the festival.) China hasno national animal-welfarelaws. Foryearsthe National People’sCon-gress, China’srubber-stamp parliament,hasdiscussed one; thisyearthe idea gotmore publicbackingthan anyotherpro-posed legislation, to judge bycommentson the government’snewswebsite. Butnothinghascome ofit.

Workerswere notallowed outoftheiroﬃcesuntil the president’sarmoured cavalcade had passed.Massive barricadeswere thrown up in Wanchai, the districtwhere MrXi wasbilleted in a luxuryhotel and the anniversarycelebrationswere held in a convention centre. Notonly were ahandful ofdetermined protesterskeptoutofsight; with no presi-dential walkabouts, even ordinaryfolkwere keptatarm’slength.Certainly, MrXi received the territory’sgrandees, and he attend-ed a mushilypatrioticvarietyshow.

Yeton hisvisitMrXi leftnodoubtthatterritorial integrityand national unitytrumped allotherconsiderations. He warned in hisanniversaryspeech thatanyattemptto “challenge the power” ofthe central governmentin Beijing, oreven the authorityofthe BasicLaw, China’sgovern-ingpreceptsforHongKong, “crossesa red line, and isabsolutelyimpermissible”. The same wentforanyperceived use ofHongKongasa base forinﬁltration and subversion ofthe mainland—howeverhazilydeﬁned.

Afterall, three-ﬁfthsofHongKongers con-sistentlyvote (when given the chance) forcandidateswho wantgreaterdemocracy—an aspiration thatChina sometimescon-struesastantamountto wantingindependence and therefore adangerousviolation ofthe red line. MrXi’snarrative ofHongKong’sreturn from British rule to China isone ofa joyous end topasthumiliation. Itfailsto resonate in a territorywhere people in-creasinglysee themselvesasHongKongersﬁrst, Chinese second.Where MrXi seesHongKong“grown exuberantlike a bam-boo ora pine tree” in the Chinese embrace, manysee constrictedpolitical space and economicopportunities. MrXi called forgreaterpatriotism in HongKong. But, democratssay, the Commu-nistPartymustunderstand thatpatriotism issomething earned,notproduced on demand. Instead ofinterferingmore and more,asksJoshua Wong, a studentactivist, whydoesn’tBeijingtrytowin youngpeople overwith liberal reforms?Even had she been democraticallyelected ratherthan hand-picked bythe central government, the newchiefexecutive, CarrieLam, whom MrXi swore in on July1st, would have a nearlyim-possible job. Herpredecessor, “C.Y.” LeungChun-ying, had pol-luted the political atmosphere byshowingfealtytowards theparty, undercuttingcolleaguesand treatingdemocratswith con-tempt.

Yet, in herﬁrstspeech aschief executive tothe Legislative Council, she dismissed the idea ofearly democrat-icreform. Thatisdisheartening. Meanwhile, the partyis droppinghintsthatitwantsMrsLam to enactanti-sedition legislation asstipulated in the BasicLaw. Plansto do so were shelved in 2003followinghuge streetproteststhatled to the earlyretirement ofthe ﬁrstchiefexecutive, “C.H.” TungChee-hwa. Since 1997 allleaders, indeed, have ended theirtime in oﬃce in failure. MrsLam risksstartinghersthatway.Guarantee? Whatguarantee?Forsome, the promise thatone country, two systemsstill hasatleast30 yearsto run remainsa consolation. Butnotforothers.Afterall, the guarantee thatHongKongwould remain unchangedfor50 yearsafterthe handoverwasagreed between Britain andChina; thattreaty, the Sino-British JointDeclaration of 1984, waseven lodged with the UN. Buton June 30th a Chinese spokesmansaid ithad “no practical signiﬁcance”. Itwas, he claimed, “notatall bindingforthe central government’smanagementoverHongKong”. Shamefully, no strongprotestcame from the British gov-ernment. HongKongpeople are on theirown.

DengXiaopingonce said thatifa further50 yearswasneeded, then HongKongwould have it. Butfewin powertalklike thatanymore. And notonlyare HongKong’sfreedomsatstake.

YetRepublican law-makersare more concerned aboutthe ef-fectofthe threatened reform on their ownvoters, millionsofwhom could lose theirhealth insurance underthe draftbill.MrMcConnell, who hashimselfbeensubjected to a range ofprotests—includingastreet-rave bygaydancersoutside hisWashington, DC, residence—maintainshewill addressall Republican objections tothe bill, and bringitto the Senate ﬂoorshortlyafterthe recess. He can hardly pro-mise less. Republican lawmakersare alsokeenlyaware thattheyface humiliationand a backlash from conservative voters ifthey—while in control ofall armsofthegovernment—cannotclaim to havescrapped Obamacare, afterhavingprom-ised forseven yearsthattheywould.Underthe provisionsofthe draft bill,which would cutan estimated $160bnfrom annual Medicaid spendingby2026compared with currentplans, MrMcCon-nell hassubstantial meansathisdisposalto tryto coaxsupport. Some senators, ledbyRob Portman ofOhio, worrythatnar-rowerMedicaid coverage would jeopar-dise treatmentforopioid addiction (seenextstory). Adollop ofextra cash for the af-fected statesmightgo a longwayto satisfy-ingthatcomplaint. Buteven with his war-chest, and reputation forruthlessness andcunning, MrMcConnell mayfail. To musterthe 50 voteshe needs(as-sumingMike Pence, the vice-president, isprepared to casta tiebreakingvote for hisparty), the majorityleadercan aﬀord tolose the supportofno more than two sena-tors(also assumingno Democraticsenatorbackshisbill). Currently, atleasttwo mod-erates, includingMsCollins, and four hard-line conservatives, includingMrCruz,have said theycannotsupportitin its cur-rentform. And MrMcConnell cannotex-pectmuch help from the presidentinbringingthem into line. An attemptby MrTrump to drum up supportforthe Republi-can bill, ata pre-recessgatheringof Repub-lican senatorsatthe White House, was un-successful. The presidentappeared not tounderstand the bill he waslobbyingfor.Maine-liningIfconservative holdoutssuch asMrCruzmayyetcome around, MsCollinsappearsprettymuch irreconcilable. “Itishard forme to see howwe getthere,” she said. “IfSenatorMitch McConnell can satisfymyconcernsso thatwe no longerhave 22mpeople losinginsurance and deep cuts toMedicaid, he will have problemssatisfy-ingsome ofourmore conservative col-leagues.” MsCollinsalso ruled outtwo al-ternative reformsbelatedlybeingpushedbysome Republicans—which indicateshowlittle MrMcConnell’sconvoluted pro-posed makeoverofObamacare isliked byanyofthem.The ﬁrst, oﬀered byMrTrump (in atweet) and backed byatleasttwo senators,Rand Paul ofKentuckyand Ben Sasse ofNebraska, would scrap Obamacare andonlylater, overthe course ofan extendedphase-outperiod, worryaboutwhatto re-place itwith. “I would notsupportthatandIdo notbelieve itwould have widespreadsupport,” said MsCollins. “I’m afraid, ifyoulookatourcurrentdiﬃculties, wewould nevergetto ‘replace’. Manyofthepeople involved in the debate wantto di-minish the role ofthe governmentin pro-vidingmedical care.” Aproposal byMrCruz, who iscertainlyone ofthem, to pla-cate moderatesbyretainingObamacare’ssubsidiesand conservativesbyallowinginsurersto provide onlybare-bonescover-age, wasalso a non-starterforMsCollins.“I don’twantto see insurance that’snotreallyinsurance.” Time isagainstMrMcConnell. The Sen-ate isdue to breakup fora month-long re-cesson July28th, and otherimportantbusinessisencroaching. Congressmustpassa budgetand raise the debtceiling, orriskthe federal governmentrunningout ofcash bythe end ofSeptember. Thatis liableto lead to similarclashesbetween moder-atesand conservativesand, on the Repub-licans’ pastform, the party’sleadersmayrequire supportfrom the Democratsto endthe impasse. Though ifthe Republicanshave justwrecked Obamacare—the proud-estachievementofa presidentrevered byDemocrats—thatsupportmightnotbeforthcoming. Thisisan additional head-ache forMrMcConnell.The debacle suggestshe, instead of im-provingon Obamacare, isdetermined torecreate itsbiggestpolitical weaknesses,and throwin some newones, too. MrObama did atleasttryto persuade his op-ponentsto backhishealth-care proposal.Yetthe factthatObamacare waspassedwithoutanyRepublican supportmade itso toxicallydivisive thatthe parties havenevertalked seriouslyaboutco-operatingto improve it. MrMcConnell isnowpro-misingthe same again—a reform that, be-cause ofthe complexityofhealth-carepolicy, aswell asthe inevitable compro-mises, misjudgementsand oversights, willatsome pointrequire bipartisan remedialaction, which, forthe same reason, wouldprobablybe unavailable to it.Thiswould be a poorwayto governeven ifthe stakes—the health care of mil-lionsand a sectorequivalentto nearly aﬁfth ofthe economy—were notso high.“The Republican leadership ismakingthesame mistake PresidentObama made,”sighed MsCollins. “Ithaswritten a verycomplex, majorhealth-care bill withoutsupportfrom the otherside.” Ifpoliticswould onlypermitcompromise, sheclaims, a group often Democraticsenatorswould stand readyto workwith moderateRepublicansto ﬁxObamacare’shigh de-ductibles, shallowmarketsand otherpro-blems. Butthatiscurrentlyunimaginable.Meanwhile, the longerthe Republicansremain consumed bythisissue, the likeliervotersare to startpinningtheirmany com-plaintsabouthealth care on theirparty—whetherMrMcConnell passeshisreformornot. “I’ve alwaysvoted Republican, but Idon’tknowwhy, orifI will again,” saidRose, a mental-health nurse and middle-aged mother, atthe parade in Eastport.

Itisa handsome property, with alarge pond in frontofthe house, longhorncattle, horsesin a paddock, horse-head sta-tuaryatthe gates. The McIvers, says How-ard Sills, the local sheriﬀ, were ornamentsofthe community: she was“the life oftheparty”, he “a gentleman” with “consum-mate manners”. On thatSunday—Septem-ber25th lastyear—theyplayed golfon apine-lined course beside Lake Oconee, a fa-vourite playground ofwell-to-do Atlan-tans. MrsMcIver, a ﬁne golfer, wason goodform. Theystopped ata steakhouse next tothe highwayforwhatwould be herlastmeal, then headed into the city. Theywere on the wayto theircondo-minium in a swankytowerin Buckhead,one ofAtlanta’sfanciestneighbourhoods.MrsMcIver, who was63 and presidentof amarketingﬁrm, had come a longwayfromherhard-up childhood in Alabama. Shemarried MrMcIver, now74 and, until re-cently, a partnerin an employment-lawﬁrm, in 2005. Originallyfrom Texas, after50 yearsin Georgia he waswell-connectedin local politics. Subsequenteventsthateveningare disputed, in a case thathascome to encapsulate the city’sriftsand pro-blems, includingrace, elitism and guns.Appropriately, italso involvesAtlanta’smain bugbear: traﬃc.The McIvers’ carwasbeingdriven bytheirfriend, Patricia Carter, known as DaniJo. MrsMcIverwasin the frontpassengerseat, herhusband sittingbehind her. Theyhita jam on whatAtlantanscall the down-town connector, a choke-pointin the heartofthe citywhere two interstatesconverge.MrMcIverhad been dozing; wakingastheyleftthe highway, he became alarmedand retrieved a revolverthatwaskept inthe car’scentral console. Afewminutes lat-er, nearPiedmontPark, Atlantans’ favour-ite park, the gun wentoﬀ—accidentally, MrMcIversays. The bulletstruckhiswife. Shedied in surgerya fewhourslater.Ifthe outline isclear, the details areblurry. Initially, forexample, CharlesCrane, then a spokesman forMrMcIver,said he tookoutthe gun in partoutof con-cern overrecentBlackLivesMatterprotestsnearby, an explanation thatirked someblackpoliticians. MrCrane also said thebulletwasﬁred when the carstruckabump in the road. Both detailshave beendisavowed byMrMcIverand histeam:there wasno bump, theyclariﬁed, nor anyworryaboutBlackLivesMatter. Instead hewasdiscomforted bythe area in which thepartyfound itselfwhen itdetoured awayfrom the congestion. (Homelesspeople,anotherdoleful feature ofAtlanta life, of-ten loiternearthatexit.) In MrMcIver’sac-count, he fell asleep again, awoke sudden-lynearthe park, and the gun discharged.The authorities’ viewofthe case hasevolved, too. In December, aftermurmursabouttheirtardiness, Atlanta policecharged MrMcIverwith involuntaryman-slaughterand recklessconduct, chargessuggestingthatthey, too, considered thedeath an accident. MrMcIverwasreleasedon bond. The districtattorney’soﬃce,however, had otherideas. Itlaunched asearch forwhatitalleged wasDianeMcIver’ssecretwill, which itaccused MrMcIverofconcealing. In courtdocuments,Paul Howard, the DA, argued thatthe elu-sive will was“likelyevidence ofthe mo-tive in herdeath”. In April a grand jury waspersuaded to elevate the chargesto mur-der, addingseveral countsofinterferingwith witnesses, namelythe spokesman,MrCrane, and MsCarter, the driver. The in-dictmentallegesthatMrMcIvertold her tosayshe had notbeen presentwhen theshootingoccurred. Bythen, he wasin jail. The terms ofhisbond forbade guns, buta search fordocu-mentsin hiscondo turned up a pistol in hissockdrawer; hislawyersinsinuated that ithad been planted, butthe judge wasunim-pressed. Latereﬀortsto secure hisrelease,pendingtrial, have been thwarted in partbyprosecutors’ claimsthatMrMcIver—who served on the state election board,amongotheraccolades—tried to swaythecase from hiscell. “I believe thatthisdefen-dant, he isdangerous,” MrHoward told thejudge duringa recentskirmish overwheth-erMrMcIverwasreceivingpreferentialtreatment. In an earlierclash, the DAtriedand failed to preventestate auctions ofthedead woman’sclothesand jewellery. Un-shaven, these days, and hangdog, glassesclipped to hissmock, MrMcIverhasclutched a bible ashe shuﬄesinto court.Days in courtHe deniesmeddlingand haspleaded notguiltyto all charges. He sayshe had no mo-tive, ﬁnancial orotherwise, to kill hiswife;histeam isadamantthatthe secretwill isaﬁction. “Itwasthe perfectmarriage,” MrMcIversaid in a jailhouse TVinterview.“He seemed verydoting,” corroboratesMrSills, the rural sheriﬀ, who isnotinvolvedin the inquiry. Defence lawyersdenouncewhattheysee as“a trophyprosecution”,accusingthe DAofwithholdingtestimonythatthe shootingwasan accident. That issaid to have come from an Atlanta detec-tive and MsCarter(though herlawyer hassaid thatshe did notsee whathappened inthe backseat). Also, mostexplosively, fromthe victim herself: a doctorwho treatedMrsMcIverrecalled thatshe “said itwasanaccidentwithoutme prompting”.The trial isscheduled forOctober. FornowMrMcIverisconﬁned behind themeshed windowsofa squat, redbrickjailin Alpharetta, north ofAtlanta. Still, amidthe fug, a central elementisstarkand clear:the gun thatkilled MrsMcIver. Herhus-band had a lotofﬁrearms, prosecutorsnote. Around 35 were taken from the ranchforsafekeepingbyMrSills, though “Here,”he says, “that’snota lotofguns.” The re-volversthatdecorate the chandelierin thecouple’sbarn are replicas, he says. MrMcIver’slawyersinsisttwo old incidentsthathave come to lightare irrelevant. Inone, he letoﬀa shotto scare a buzzard foraBuckhead neighbour; in the other, in 1990,he wasindicted afterﬁringin the vicinityofa carload ofteenagers, in self-defence,he maintained.

The future president wasnotyet“Ronnie”, America’sreassuring, twinkling, optimist-in-chief. He wasstill “Dutch”, to use hischildhood nickname: a slim,bespectacled youth, seriousto the pointofpriggishness. Abiog-rapher, GarryWills, unearthed a high school yearbookin whichReagan scolded swimmershe pulled from the cool, treacherousRockRiver, nearhisboyhood home ofDixon, Illinois. “Abighip-popotamuswith a sandwich in each hand, and some ﬁrewatertanked away,” Reagan wrote ofone. Each summerfrom 1927 to1932 the teenagerwould rise earlyto collecta 300lb blockoficeand hamburgersuppliesbefore drivingin hisemployer’svan tothe river, working12 hoursa day, seven daysa week. The post of-fered responsibility, moneyforcollege and stabilityin a child-hood blighted byfrequentmoves, brusheswith ﬁnancial ruinand hisfather’sdrinking. There wasglory, too: in all he saved 77lives. Apicture ofthe RockRiverhungin Reagan’sOval Oﬃce.Strikinglyoften, self-made Americanshave storiesto shareaboutteenage jobs, involvingalarm clocksclangingbefore dawn,achingmuscles, stern bossesand soul-fortifyinghoursof bore-dom. In 1978, a record yearin the annalsofthe Bureauof LabourStatistics, 72% ofall teenagerswere employed in July, the peakmonth foryouthful ice-cream scooping, shelf-stackingand bur-ger-ﬂipping. Butfortwo decadesthe traditional summer job hasbeen in decline, with 43% ofteensworkingin July2016.Lexington decided to head to Dixon to askwhy. Thisbeing ananxiousand litigiousage, Reagan’sriverbeach isclosed now. Butthe YMCAthattrained him in lifesaving(and where he paradedasa drum major) still hireslifeguards. Thissummerﬁnds one ofthem, Lexi Nelson, 18, between high school and communitycol-lege, where she will studydental hygiene. Perhapsa quarter ofherfriendsare workingthisseason. The resthave mixed viewsofherjob, which can startatﬁve in the morning. “When I getup ear-lytheybash on it,” MissNelson reports, “butmostofthe timethey’re jealousofthe money.” Lifeguardingin an indoorpool isnotthe mostexcitingjob, she concedes, butthatteaches patience.The storyofthe vanishingjob isnota simple one. Ask teen-agers, theiremployersand the mayorofDixon—a business-own-erwho hiresteenagerseach summerata pairofsandwich shopsand a frozen yogurtstore—and theypointto two main causes:well-meaningadultsand a changingeconomy.Reagan’sstirringexample isstill taughtin Dixon, a trim, con-servative town, with an equestrian statue ofthe president on itsriverfrontand loudspeakerson lamp-poststhatplaythe Carpen-tersand othereasy-listeningclassics. Butmanyparents discour-age teensfrom working, itiswidelyagreed. Parentsinstead telltheirchildren to study, take summercourses, volunteer orprac-tise forsportsthatmighthelp them compete forcollege places.Local keepersofthe Reagan ﬂame see a town still ﬁlled withopportunitiesforself-advancement. PatrickGorman, director ofthe Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home, a museum thatpreserves ahouse rented bythe president’sfamilyin Dixon, isconﬁdent thatanyone who wantsa job can ﬁnd one, even ifitmightbe “de-tasseling” corn—pickingpollen tasselsfrom growingcorn cobs,an arduoussummertasktraditionallyreserved forthe young, in-volvingcold mornings, bakingmiddaysand scratchesfrom cornleaves. MrGorman easilyfound sixteenagersto volunteer asmu-seum guides: “Good kidsmigrate to good kids,” he beams.Notall teenagershave the same needs. The three lifeguards in-terviewed atthe YMCAare eithercollege-bound orplan to be,and part-time worksuitsthem. Bossesatthe “Y” note thatyoung-sterswith onlya high-school education typicallyhave a diﬀerentgoal: landinga full-time job with health insurance and beneﬁts.Liandro Arellano Jr., Dixon’smayor, arguesthatteenage jobprospectshave been complicated bywell-intentioned politiciansraisingthe state-wide minimum wage to $8.25 an hour. Forthatpayitisboth temptingand possible to hire college students orolderworkerswith a proven job record, referencesand the abilityto turn up on time, saysMrArellano, a Republican. The youngestworkers, below18, earn $7.75 butneed more training, and thoseaged 15 need workpermitsand cannottouch slicersorbig breadknives. Largereconomicforceshave buﬀeted Dixon, too. Afterthe creditcrunch of2008, a ﬂood oflaid-oﬀfactoryworkers andexperienced adultswanted to workforMrArellano. With unem-ploymentratesnowbelow5% in Dixon, applicantsforentry-lev-el jobsare gettingyoungeragain. Teenagerscan be ﬁne summerhelpers, he says—“They’re veryexcited abouttheirﬁrstjob”—though keepingthem oﬀsmartphonesis“a constantbattle”.Buythatteenageran alarm clockNationwide, aﬄuentwhite teenagershave historicallybeenmuch more likelyto take summerjobsthan lower-income, non-white youths. Familyconnectionshelp, and itiseasier to ﬁndworkata golfcourse ortennisclub than amid inner-city blight.Though bigcitieslike Chicago, 100 milesfrom Dixon, have gov-ernment-run schemesthatprod employersto oﬀersummerwork, demand exceedssupply: lastyear77,000 Chicago youthsapplied for31,000 summerjobsorinternships. Forall that, someofMrArellano’sworststaﬀhave been youngsterswho do notneed the moneyorwanta job reference: theyare the ones whoquitwithoutwarningto go on a familyholiday. Well-oﬀ parentsare notalways“super-supportive”, he sighs.Some parentsmayquestion the value ofmanual workin anage ofhigh-tech change. Butan elite education countsfor littlewithoutself-discipline and resilience. Drudgerycan teach humil-ity: when haulingboxes, a brain full ofalgebra matters lessthan ateen’smuscles. Atbest, itcan breach the social barriers thatharmdemocracy.

Despite the shadowof thedictatorship, conﬁdence rankingsofinsti-tutionsoften putthe armyatthe top.Soldiersare tryingto adaptto their newrole.

The new old

Ageing populations could be a boon rather than a curse. But for
that to happen, a lot needs to change ﬁrst, argues Sacha Nauta

“NO AGE JOKES tonight, all right?” quipped Sir Mick Jagger, the 73-year-
old front man of the Rolling Stones (pictured), as he welcomed the
crowds to Desert Trip Music Festival in California last October. The per-
formers’ average age was just one year below Sir Mick’s, justifying his de-
scription of the event as “the Palm Springs Retirement Home for British
Musicians”. But these days mature rock musicians sell: the festival raked
in an estimated $160m. 
There are many more 70-somethings than there used to be, though
most of them are less of a draw than the Stones. In America today a 70-
year-old man has a 2% chance of dying within a year; in 1940 this mile-
stone was passed at 56. In 1950 just 5% of the world’s population was over
65; in 2015 the share was 8%, and by 2050 it is expected to rise to 16%. Rich
countries, on which this report is focused, are greying more than the de-
veloping world (except for China, which is already well on the way to get-
ting old); the share of over-65s in the OECD is set to increase from 16% in
2015 to 25% by 2050. This has knock-on eﬀects in older age groups too. Brit-
ain, which had just 24 centenarians in 1917, now has nearly 15,000. 
Globally, a combination of falling birth rates and increasing life-
spans will increase the “old-age dependency ratio” (the ratio of people
aged 65 or over to those aged 15-64) from 13% in 2015 to 38% by the end of
the century. To listen to the doomsayers, this could lead not just to labour
shortages but to economic stagnation, asset-market meltdowns, huge ﬁs-
cal strains and a dearth of innovation. Spending on pensions and health
care, which already makes up over 16% of GDP in the rich world, will rise
to 25% by the end of this century if nothing is done, predicts the IMF.
Much of the early increases in life expectancy were due not to peo-
ple living longer but to lower death rates among infants and children,

2 thanks to improvements in basic hygiene and public health.
From the start of the 20th century survival rates in old age started
to improve markedly, particularly in the rich world, a trend that
continues today. More recently, life spans—the estimated upper
limits of average life expectancy—have also been increasing. Un-
til the 1960s they seemed ﬁxed at 89, but since then they have ris-
en by eight years, thanks in part to medical advances such as or-
gan replacements and regenerative medicine. The UN estimates
that between 2010 and 2050 the number of over-85s globally will
grow twice as much as that of the over-65s, and 16 times as much
as that of everyone else.
Warnings about a “silver time bomb” or “grey tsunami”
have been sounding for the past couple of decades, and have of-
ten been couched in terms of impending ﬁnancial disaster and
intergenerational warfare. Barring a rise in productivity on a
wholly unlikely scale, it is economically unsustainable to pay
out generous pensions for 30 years or more to people who may
have been contributing to such schemes only for a similar
amount of time. But this special report will argue that the longer,
healthier lives that people in the rich world now enjoy (and
which in the medium term are in prospect in the developing
world as well) can be a boon, not just for the individuals con-
cerned but for the economies and societies they are part of. The
key to unlocking this longevity dividend is to turn the over-65s
into more active economic participants.
This starts with acknowledging that many of those older
people today are not in fact “old” in the sense of being worn out,

sick and inactive. Today’s 65-year-olds are in much better shape
than their grandparents were at the same age. In most EU coun-
tries healthy life expectancy from age 50 is growing faster than
life expectancy itself, suggesting that the period of diminished
vigour and ill health towards the end of life is being compressed
(though not all academics agree). Yet in most countries the age at
which people retire has barely shifted over the past century.
When Otto von Bismarck brought in the ﬁrst formal pensions in
the 1880s, payable from age 70 (later reduced to 65), life expectan-
cy in Prussia was 45. Today in the rich world 90% of the popula-
tion live to celebrate their 65th birthday, mostly in good health,
yet that date is still seen as the starting point of old age.
This year the peak cohort of American baby-boomers turns
60. As they approach retirement in unprecedented numbers,
small tweaks to retirement
ages and pensions will no lon-
ger be enough. This special re-
port will argue that a radically
diﬀerent approach to ageing
and life after 65 is needed. 
The problems already in
evidence today, and the greater
ones
feared for
tomorrow,
largely arise from the failure of
institutions and markets to
keep up with longer and more
productive lives. Inﬂexible la-
bour markets and social-sup-
port systems all assume a sud-
den cliﬀ-edge at 60 or 65. Yet in
the rich world at least, a new
stage of life is emerging, be-

Making longer lives ﬁnancially more viable requires a
fundamental rethink of life trajector ies

tween the end of the conventional working age and the onset of
old age as it used to be understood. 
Those new “young old” are in relatively good health, often
still work, have money they spend on non-age-speciﬁc things,
and will run a mile if you mention “silver”. They want ﬁnancial
security but are after something more ﬂexible than the tradition-
al retirement products on oﬀer. They will remain productive for
longer, not just because they need to but because they want to
and because they can. They can add great economic value, both
as workers and as consumers. But the old idea of a three-stage life
cycle—education, work, retirement—is so deeply ingrained that
employers shun this group and business and the ﬁnancial indus-
try underserve it.

What’s in a name?

History shows that identifying a new life stage can bring
about deep institutional change. A new focus on childhood in
the 19th century paved the way for child-protection laws, manda-
tory schooling and a host of new businesses, from toymaking to
children’s books. And when teenagers were ﬁrst singled out as a
group in America in the 1940s, they turned out to be a great
source of revenue, thanks to their willingness to work part-time
and spend their income freely on new goods and services. Such
life stages are social constructs, but they have real consequences. 
This report will argue that making longer lives ﬁnancially
more viable, as well as productive and enjoyable, requires a fun-
damental rethink of life trajectories and a new look at the as-
sumptions around ageing. Longevity is
now widespread and needs to be planned
for. The pessimism about ageing popula-
tions is based on the idea that the moment
people turn 65, they move from being net
contributors to the economy to net recipi-
ents of beneﬁts. But if many more of them remain economically
active, the process will become much more gradual and nu-
anced. And the market that serves these consumers will expand
if businesses make a better job of meeting their needs. 
The most important way of making retirement ﬁnancially
sustainable will be to postpone it by working longer, often part-
time. But much can be gained, too, by improving retirement pro-
ducts. The ﬁnancial industry needs to update the life-cycle mod-
el on which most of its products and advice are based. Longer
lives require not just larger pots of money but more ﬂexibility in
the way they can be used. 
As deﬁned-beneﬁt pension schemes become a thing of the
past, people need to be encouraged to set aside enough money
for their retirement, for example through auto-enrolment
schemes. It would also help if some of the better-oﬀ pensioners
spent more and saved less. They would be more likely to do that
if the insurance industry were to improve its oﬀerings to protect
older people against some of the main risks, such as getting de-
mentia or living to 120. Many people’s biggest asset, their home,
could also play a larger part in funding longer lives. 
And for the oldest group, increasingly there will be clever
technology to help them make the most of the ﬁnal stage of their
lives, enabling them to age at home and retain as much autono-
my as possible. Perhaps surprisingly, products and services de-
veloped mainly for the young, such as smartphones, social me-
dia, connected homes and autonomous cars, could also be of
great beneﬁt to the older old.
But the report will start with the most obvious thing that
needs to change for the younger old: the workplace. Again, there
are parallels with young people. Working in the gig economy, as
so many of them do, may actually be a better ﬁt for those heading
for retirement. 7

causing large numbers to take early retirement even as life expec-
tancy was rising. At the same time fertility rates were dropping,
conjuring up the risk of future labour shortages. By the 1990s gov-
ernments and employers realised they were making pension
promises they would not be able to keep. The idea that there is
only a ﬁnite number of jobs to go round—the “lump of labour”—
was more widely exposed as a fallacy. It became fashionable to
argue that “we must work till we drop.” 

A work ethic like no other

The baby-boomer generation, known for its energy and as-
sertiveness, has embraced that creed, but on its own terms. Many
of its members had always been planning to work past their for-
mal retirement age, both for the fun of it and because they need-
ed the money. Aegon, an insurer, found in a recent survey that
more than half of workers over 55 were hoping for a ﬂexible tran-
sition to retirement, but only a quarter said their employers
would let them work part-time. Age discrimination in both re-
tention and recruitment is also a serious obstacle to keeping peo-
ple in work for longer. One American study involving 40,000 ﬁc-
titious CVs sent
in response to advertised vacancies for
low-skilled jobs found that applicants between 49 and 51 had 19%
fewer callbacks than those aged 29 to 31 with otherwise identical
CVs. For the 64-66 age group the diﬀerence was 35%. 
In response to such discrimination and inﬂexibility, some
boomers try their luck in the gig economy. Though gigging is usu-
ally seen as something that young people do, in many ways it
suits older people better. They are often content to work part-
time, are not looking for career progression and are better able to
deal with the precariousness of such jobs. A quarter of drivers
for Uber, an on-demand taxi service, are over 50. More broadly, a
quarter of all Americans who say they work in the “sharing econ-
omy” are over 55, according to PwC, a consultancy.
“Now I manage my own future. I manage my own life,”
says Aykut Durgun, a 60-year-old former retail manager who
drives his beautifully kept Mazda 5 for Uber and Lyft, another
ride-hailing ﬁrm, in San Francisco. The change from managing
40 people to being ordered around by a 20-year-old in the back
seat took some getting used to, but he loves the socialising, ﬂexi-
bility and challenge of navigating the city’s grid. The money isn’t
bad either; he earns about $6,000 a month before tax and sees no
reason to slow down: “It’s the best way to prevent dementia.” 
It helps that the gig economy has moved well beyond deliv-
ering pizzas or people. Businesses that oﬀer on-demand lawyers,
accountants, teachers and personal assistants are ﬁnding plenty
of recruits among older people. Wahve (short for Work At Home
Vintage Experts), a New York-based company, provides work for

Footloose and
fancy-free

The recently retired may have a promising future as
entrepreneurs and giggers

IN THE SHADOW of towering apartment blocks in No-
won-gu, a suburb of Seoul, employees of CJ Logistics, a
large South Korean delivery company, gather at the local welfare
centre. A truck pulls up and the group, mostly men in their 70s,
leap to their feet to unload parcels. “It’s far better than staying at
home,” says Eun Ho Lee, a chirpy 77-year-old who in his younger
days ran a bedlinen business. Like so many of his generation in
this country, he has no pension and lives mainly on his savings,
so the 800,000-900,000 won ($700-800) he makes from this job
are welcome. He cannot imagine himself ever leaving.
There are drawbacks to older workers, admits a local super-
visor; they carry fewer boxes and are sometimes slower than
their younger colleagues. But since the company pays its employ-
ees per delivery, that does not matter, and the unhurried chatti-
ness of this side of the business, the “Senior Parcel Delivery Ser-
vice”, seems to appeal to customers.
In the rich world, and especially in Europe, the debate
about retirement tends to focus on intergenerational conﬂict:
pay-as-you-go public pension schemes mean that the young, in
eﬀect, are paying for the old. But if older people were to carry on
working for longer, the resulting economic boost would beneﬁt
young and old alike, generating extra growth. The average 65-
year-old in the rich world can now expect to live for another 20
years, half of them free of disability. If people in “older” coun-
tries, such as Germany, Japan and Spain, were to delay retire-
ment by 2-2.5 years per decade between 2010 and 2050, it would
be enough to oﬀset the eﬀect of demographic change, according
to Andrew Mason, of the University of Hawaii, and Ronald Lee,
of the University of California, Berkeley. 
Older workers may be forgiven if they feel confused about
whether or not they are wanted. In the period after the second
world war, Britons preparing for retirement were told that “your
economy needs you.” Then, from the 1970s onwards, they (and
many fellow Europeans) were urged to make way for the young,

hundreds of former ﬁnance and insurance professionals, mostly
in their 60s and 70s. “Carriers and brokers have huge talent pro-
blems, it takes years to train an underwriter,” says Sharon Emek,
the ﬁrm’s 71-year-old founder. She realised boomers were retir-
ing from the workforce but didn’t want to stop working; so now
they are “pre-tiring”. 

Startup generation

The boomers are also becoming entrepreneurs. In America
those between 55 and 65 are now 65% more likely to start up com-
panies than those between 20 and 34, according to the Kauﬀman
Foundation. In Britain 40% of new founders are over 50, and al-
most 60% of the over-70s who are still working are self-em-
ployed, which says as much about the limitations of conven-
tional workplaces as about these seniors’ entrepreneurial spirit.
In Japan and South Korea, which are among the world’s
fastest-ageing societies, large companies tend to get rid of older
workers as they approach 60, and many of those workers then
start a business. Some employers, including Hyundai, now also
help older workers make the transition to life as an entrepreneur.
But “it’s not employers’ job to save society. They need to see
the business case for older workers,” says Laura Carstensen of

Rock around the clock

The other gig economy

ROCKERS ARE NO diﬀerent from the rest of
us: they, too, need to work for longer to
maintain a decent standard of living in
retirement. Previous generations could rely
on record sales and royalties to fund their
pensions, but digital disruption has largely
closed oﬀ such revenues, so the per formers
have to get back on the road. That involves
new ﬁnancial r isks. Rock stars have always
been r isky assets; one study suggests that
they are 1.7 times as likely to die as others of
the same age. Now that revenues from
concer ts have become so much more impor-
tant, the potential losses to tour organisers
have ballooned. That applies all the more if
the per formers are a bunch of 70-year-olds
who may not always have treated their
bodies as temples.
This is where ﬁnanciers come in.
Concer t organisers and others who depend
on mature rockers for their income are more
likely to insure against the r isk that their
per formers might not show up, says Jona-
than Thomas, a Lloyd’s underwr iter. He has
seen this market for “non-appearance
products” grow as musicians get older. Film
studios take out similar cover for mature
stars. Disney must have been relieved to
have done so for Carr ie Fisher, who died at
the age of 60 last year before completing
ﬁlming on all the “Star Wars” ﬁlms she was
contracted for, tr igger ing a claim which
could go up to $50m.
Rockers themselves are also taking

Stanford University. That requires a few myths about older work-
ers to be tackled; mainly that they are less able-bodied, inventive
and productive than the young. This may have been true 50
years ago, but both the workplace and the workers have
changed. Over the past decades the point at which workers are
physically no longer able to work has shifted much further up
the age range. The idea that only the young can innovate has also
been successfully challenged.
Whether older workers are less productive than younger
ones is harder to say. In ﬁelds where physical prowess matters,
such as sports, it is obvious. But in many areas performance does
not necessarily decline with advancing age. And even in jobs
where it might, there are often ways of getting round it. 
As Gernot Sendowski, head of diversity at Deutsche Bank
in Germany, explains: “In operational work older employees can
be slower, but they make up for that with fewer mistakes, so in to-
tal they are no less productive. If we had teams with only older
people, they’d be too slow; if we had teams with only younger
ones, there’d be too many mistakes.” The bank’s answer is to de-
ploy multigenerational teams.
Mercer, a consultancy, has also found that older workers’
contribution is more likely to show up in group performance
than in traditional individual perfor-
mance metrics (how many widgets some-
one makes per hour). “It seems the contri-
bution of older workers materialises in
the 
increased productivity of
those
around them,” says Haig Nalbantian, a
partner in the ﬁrm. In repetitive work, pro-
ductivity does seem to fall with age, but in
knowledge-based jobs, age seems to
make no diﬀerence to performance, ﬁnds
Axel Börsch-Supan, of the Max-Planck In-
stitute in Munich. And when such jobs
also require social skills (as in the case of
ﬁnancial advisers, for example), produc-
tivity actually increases with age, he adds.
That should give older knowledge work-
ers an advantage in the world of artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI), where social skills may
be at a premium. 
All this bodes better for high-skilled
older workers than for low-skilled ones.
“Who gets to stay healthy is not random;
education is by far the top predictor,” says
Ms Carstensen. And more highly educat-
ed Americans are more likely to work on
for longer, write David Bloom, from Har-
vard University, and colleagues. It has also
become clear that some work can be good
for both physical and cognitive health.
This helps explain the substantial gap in
both general and healthy life expectancy
between skilled and unskilled workers,
which could grow wider unless everyone
has access to lifelong learning to make
them more adaptable.
Fortunately the sort of changes to
working life that older workers are look-
ing for—ﬂexible hours, a workplace de-
signed with wellness in mind, the oppor-
tunity to keep learning—are also just the
sort of things that millennials demand
from prospective employers. And if em-
ployers keep their costs down by getting 

out insurance against the most common
ailments that could stop them from carrying
on working. Aside from overdosing, typical
career-ending injur ies used to include
electrocution (all that electr ical equip-
ment), but now are more likely to be osteo-
porosis and loss of hear ing. The Rolling
Stones’ lead guitar ist, Keith Richards, who
is 73, has insured his hands for $1.6m. 
Underwr iters are ready to accept their
clients’ lifestyle and work hazards, arguing
that where there is r isk, there is reward—if
the pr ice is r ight. “It’s a badly misunder-
stood market, and one 70-year-old rocker is
not like the other; there’s plenty of scope for
savvy underwr iting,” says one of them. And
the insurers do take precautions. Exclusions
for pre-existing conditions, especially those
related to alcohol abuse or failing livers, are
common.
Rockers of advanced years are also
good for busting stereotypes about older
workers. Their energy levels may be lower,
but they of ten pace themselves more and
look af ter themselves better than in their
younger days; not so much sex and drugs,
more tea and yoga. Sometimes such moder-
ation is imposed by their insurers. The
Stones “14 on Fire” tour contract is said to
have contained exclusion clauses for a
var iety of dangerous pursuits. Besides, says
the underwr iter, by the age of 70 some of
the r iskier rockers have already been weed-
ed out by the Gr im Reaper.

rid of age-related perks, such as seniority-based pay and promo-
tion, they will have less reason to shun older people—and make
the workplace fairer and more productive for everyone.
One large economic contribution made by older people
that does not show up in the numbers is unpaid work. In Italy
and Portugal around one grandmother in ﬁve provides daily care
for a grandchild, estimates Karen Glaser from King’s College Lon-
don. That frees parents to go out to work, saving huge sums on
child care. In Britain unpaid older caregivers save the state
around £11.4bn per year, according to Age UK, a charity. 
Apart from providing support within the family, a quarter
of people also aspire to doing some voluntary work after retire-
ment, according to a recent study by Aegon. In America the
over-55s formally volunteered 3.3bn hours in 2016, making an
economic contribution worth $78bn, says the Corporation for
National and Community Service, a federal agency. A number of
studies have found that this beneﬁts not only the good causes
they work for but also their own physical and mental health. 
But there is another way in which older people support the
economy: by spending their money. 7

Consumers

Don’t call us silver

From adventure travel to dating websites, older
consumers display resolutely young tastes

“THERE’S NOTHING WRONG with bingo and chicken,”
says Tom Kamber, before explaining why you won’t ﬁnd ei-
ther in the senior centre he runs in Manhattan. Instead, members
of the Senior Planet Exploration Centre are given VR goggles and
other digital gadgets to play with, though most head straight for a
wall of computers to check their Facebook accounts or shop on-
line. A group of 15 seniors, some in their 80s, clad in sportswear,
huddle around their ﬁtness coach. People come for classes on
starting their own businesses, using smartphones, booking tra-
vel on the web and setting up online dating proﬁles. “We just de-
mystify the technology and away they go,” explains Mr Kamber. 
Businesses could learn from this. With longer lives, more
free time and a lot of cash, older people clearly present a “silver
dollar” opportunity. In America the over-50s will shortly ac-
count for 70% of disposable income, according to a forecast by

The Economist July 8th 2017

Nielsen, a market-research organisation. Global spending by
households headed by over-60s could amount to $15tn by 2020,
twice as much as in 2010, predicts Euromonitor, another market-
research outﬁt. Much of this will go on leisure.
Yet the market has failed to respond to this opportunity,
even though it has been clear for a long time that the baby-boom-
ers would start to retire in larger numbers, in better health and
with more money to spend than any previous generation. They
feel much younger than their parents did at their age, and most of
them have no intention of quietly retreating from the world. “Re-
tirement used to be a brief period between cruise ships and
wheelchairs, with a bout of norovirus,” says Joe Coughlin, who
runs the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Now it has become a complete new stage of life, as long as child-
hood or mid-life, which boomers want to structure very diﬀer-
ently; “yet we still oﬀer my grandfather’s retirement.”
Over-60s adventure travel has become a booming business
opportunity. In America more than 40% of adventure travellers
are over 50, according to the Adventure Travel Trade Association.
In Britain older travellers are the largest spenders in the industry,
with the fastest growth in the 65-74 age group. Instead of comfort-
able cruises or bus tours, they demand action, from expeditions
to the Arctic to cultural trips to Asia. 
Jane Dettloﬀ, a 73-year-old from Minnesota, has just re-
turned from a two-week cycling tour in Chile. “The culture, the
cuisine, the beaches and—oof—the Andes wine!” By day the 16
women, aged 61 to 87, pedalled, chatted and “felt like young girls
again”. By night they enjoyed “wine-o’clock, without the whin-
ing about pills”. The travel company that organised the tour, VBT,
does not explicitly bill itself as a specialist in senior travel, but of-
fers subtle hints: “at your own pace”, “since 1971”, “good wine”.
More than 90% of its customers are over 50.

Out of date

Another emerging market is dating. Whereas overall di-
vorce rates are falling in some countries, including America, Aus-
tralia and Britain, “silver splits” are soaring as new pensioners
suddenly face the prospect of spending a lot more time with their
partner. Americans over 60 are now getting divorced at twice the
rate as they were in 1990, and Britons at three times the rate, write
Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott in “The 100-Year Life”. More
than a quarter of the members of Match.com, a popular dating
website, are between 53 and 72, and that group is growing faster
than any other. 
Older people seem more concerned than younger ones
about the risks of online dating, prompting the setting up of spe-
cialised sites such as Stitch, an online companionship site with
85,000 members. “There’s more fun to be had after 50,” pro-
claims its promotional video, adding that “it’s all very safe.” Old-
er customers seem more willing to pay for online memberships
than the young, provided they add value. Stitch screens mem-
bers and organises social events, explains Andrew Dowling, the
co-founder. “Most people want companionship, but dating does
change with age.”
Jody, from New Jersey, was inspired by her nieces, who all
use dating apps, and ended up at a Stitch “drinks and mingling”
event in a trendy New York bar. It turned out to be ten women
sipping Margaritas, laughing as they swapped experiences of
disastrous online dates and debating whether they would be
more likely to meet a man if they went in for predominantly
male activities such as mountain biking or golf.
Women spend more on trying to ﬁnd a companion than
men, because in the higher age groups there are more of them (in
the rich world they live an average of ﬁve years longer), and they
are more likely to be single. In 2014 nearly three-quarters of

1

American men over 65 were married and only one in ten was
widowed; of women in the same age group, under half were
married and one in three was widowed. In Europe, too, women
over 65 are more than twice as likely as men to be living alone.
This can be problematic if they lack adequate savings, but also
opens up new demand for all sorts of things that hardly anyone
would have imagined a generation ago.
One is diﬀerent sorts of accommodation. With longer time
horizons ahead of them, the younger old are spurning lonely
granny ﬂats and looking for something more convivial, closer to
a bachelor pad. “Retired golden girl seeks two cosmopolitan,
easy-going, positive people with a (wacky) sense of humour to
share this lovely, charming property,” starts an ad on golden-
girlsnetwork.com, a single-senior housemate-ﬁnding website. 
But businesses that want to get into this new market of the
younger old should note that they are fussy. They do not see
themselves as old, and will respond badly to ads speciﬁcally tar-
geted at older people (as Crest found when it launched a tooth-
paste for the 50+ age group). The over-50s are also intolerant of
websites or gadgets that underdeliver, says Martin Lock of Silver-
surfers.com, the largest over-50s community in Britain: “If some-
thing doesn’t work, they’ll be the ﬁrst to leave.”
Between now and 2030, most of the growth in consump-
tion in the developed world’s cities will come from the over-60s,
according to McKinsey, a consultancy. So this is the market to go
for; but to provide the wherewithal, the ﬁnancial industry will
ﬁrst have to reinvent itself. 7

Finance

Your money and your
life

As lives get longer, ﬁnancial models will have to
change

IN 1965 ANDRÉ-FRANÇOIS RAFFRAY, a 47-year-old lawyer
in southern France, made the deal of a lifetime. Charmed by
an apartment in Arles, he persuaded the widow living there that
if he paid her 2,500 francs (then about $500) a month until she
died, she would leave it to him in her will. Since she was already
90, it seemed like a safe bet. Thirty years later Mr Raﬀray was
dead and the widow, Jeanne Louise Calment, was still going
strong. When she eventually passed away at 122, having become
the world’s oldest person, the Raﬀray family had paid her more
than twice the value of the house.
Underestimating how long someone will live can be costly,
as overgenerous governments and indebted private pension
schemes have been discovering. They are struggling to meet
promises made in easier times. Public pensions are still the main
source of income for the over-65s across the OECD, but there are
big diﬀerences between countries (see chart, next page). In both
America and Britain public provision replaces around 40% of
previous earnings, but in some European countries it can be 80%
or more. Where it makes up a big share of total pension income,
as in Italy, Portugal and Greece, a shrinking workforce will in-
creasingly struggle to ﬁnance a bulging group of pensioners.
Private pension schemes, which supplement state provi-
sion, have been shifting from deﬁned-beneﬁt plans, where work-
ers are promised a ﬁxed amount of income in retirement, to de-
ﬁned-contribution plans, where workers themselves take on the
risk. Such schemes are good for employers but tricky for individ-

uals, who become personally responsible for ensuring they do
not outlive their savings. The new stage of life now emerging be-
tween work and old age adds a further complication. To accom-
modate these changes, the ﬁnancial industry needs an overhaul. 
First, it has to update the rigid three-stage life-cycle model
on which most of its products are based. Second, it needs to re-
solve two opposite but equally troubling problems: undersaving
during working life and oversaving during retirement. The ﬁrst
puts pressure on public provision, the second leads to undercon-
sumption as cash is left under the mattress. Third, a more creative
approach is needed to the range of assets that pensioners can
draw on, including their homes, which have so far played little
part in provision for old age.
“In a multi-stage life, the idea of hitting a cliﬀ-edge retire-
ment at 65 and then living oﬀ an annuity is outdated,” says Alis-
tair Byrne, from State Street Global Advisors, a money manager.
His clients, many of whom intend to work past normal retire-
ment age, are asking for more ﬂexibility to get at their savings at a
younger age. They also want a secure income for the last phase of
life. “It’s not at all obvious that the traditional pension industry,
which still sees life as a three-stage event, will survive this transi-
tion,” says Andrew Scott of the London Business School. 

Nothing in the kitty

Many people simply do not save enough. Roughly 40% of
Americans approach retirement with no savings at all in widely
used retirement accounts such as IRAs or 401(k)s. In Britain 20%
of women and 12% of men between 55 and 65 have no retirement
savings, according to Aegon. Yet with the demise of deﬁned-
beneﬁt schemes, the increase in the retirement age and the
steady rise in life expectancy, most of today’s workers will need
to save more than their parents did. Some of them do not earn
enough to put money aside, but for many the problem is in the
mind: they consistently underestimate how long they will live
and overestimate how long their money will last. As more peo-
ple become self-employed, getting them to save for their old age
becomes ever more important. 
One solution is to allow retirement funds to be used more
ﬂexibly, which may encourage people to save more. But nudges
are unlikely to be enough. “People need a push,” says Myungki
Cho, from Samsung Life’s Retirement Research Centre in Seoul.
Some countries, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, provide
such a push by making enrolment in pension schemes more or
less mandatory. Short of that, auto-enrolment, recently intro-

duced in Britain, and auto-escalation (increasing contributions
over time) can also make a diﬀerence. 
At the same time many pensioners spend less than they can
aﬀord, which creates its own problems. Ronald Lee and Andrew
Mason have found that in most rich countries the elderly are net
savers. Since they cannot be sure how long they will live and
what their state of health will be, and have no way of predicting
inﬂation, interest rates and markets, some caution is clearly in or-
der. But Chip Castille, from BlackRock, an asset manager, thinks
oversaving is often unintentional. “It would be an extraordinary
coincidence if you saved exactly enough for retirement,” he says. 
This gets to the heart of why some economists are pessimis-
tic about greying societies. In a phase when older people should
be spending freely, many are accumulating wealth, says David
Sinclair, of the ILC UK. He thinks the greater pension freedoms
granted in Britain in 2015 are more likely to lead to frugality rather
than spending sprees.
Such “accidental” oversaving will increase in a world of de-
ﬁned-contribution plans, predicts Tony Webb, an economist at
the New School, in New York City. Given a choice, people will as-
semble their own kitties rather than buy annuities that provide
an agreed lifetime income in exchange for a lump sum. If they die
young, the money will be a windfall for their heirs. Similarly,
since money locked up in homes is diﬃcult to get at during the
owner’s lifetime, much of this too will be passed on, Mr Webb
adds. Raising inheritance-tax rates could make a diﬀerence, but
better insurance is equally important. This dormant wealth,
which is often neither invested nor spent, is stopping many of
the younger old from realising their full economic potential. “Of-
ten people just need the conﬁdence that we’ve run the numbers
and that they really can aﬀord to make that donation to a charity,
or spend a little more on themselves,” says Kai Stinchcombe,
from True Link, a ﬁnancial-advice ﬁrm for pensioners. 

Take care

Depending on where people live, how much they earn and
whether they have family willing to care for them, one of the
greatest ﬁnancial risks of ageing can be end-of-life care expendi-
ture. A 50-year-old American has a better-than-even chance of
ending up in a nursing home, estimate Michael Hurd and col-
leagues from RAND, a research organisation in America. In Brit-
ain an oﬃcial review in 2011 of long-term care reckoned that a
quarter of older people in Britain needed very little care towards
the end of life but 10% faced care costs in excess of £100,000. 

The Economist July 8th 2017

Most countries will need to ﬁnd a mix of public and private
provision to pay for long-term care costs. A well-functioning in-
surance market should be an important part of this, but care in-
surance has mostly failed to take oﬀ. American providers who
piled in too enthusiastically in the 1990s got burnt when custom-
ers needed more care than expected, and are still haunted by the
experience. Low rates of return on bonds have not helped. 
Every country has its own peculiarities, but four common
factors help explain the market failures. First, the future of public
care is uncertain. Second, despite or because of this, many peo-
ple think they do not need insurance because the state or their
family will look after them. Third, the market is subject to “ad-
verse selection”—the likelihood that insurance will appeal only
to those most at risk of needing care. And fourth, care costs are
unpredictable and could spin out of control in the future. As a re-
sult, insurers either avoid the care market altogether, or charge ex-
orbitant premiums and add lots of restrictions. 
As with any big risk, pools need to be large to make protec-
tion products work. The easiest way to achieve this is to make in-
surance compulsory, as in Germany. One alternative is auto-en-
rolment in a public-private scheme with an opt-out, a method
with which Singapore is experimenting. At a minimum, some
government intervention—such as providing a backstop for the
most catastrophic risks—seems to be required for the market to
establish itself. But perhaps the biggest problem is that govern-
ment policies chop and change far too often. 
Insurers could help, not least by oﬀering more hybrid pro-
ducts such as life insurance with the option of an advance on the
payout if customers need care, or annuities that pay a lower-
than-usual income but convert to a higher-than-usual rate if pre-
agreed care levels become necessary. And there is a need for
clearer guarantees against unexpected premium hikes. Most im-
portantly, though, insurers will need to persuade people to enroll
long before they are likely to require any care. 
By far the most common reason for someone needing long-
term care is that they are suﬀering from Alzheimer’s or some oth-
er form of dementia. Globally around 47m people have demen-
tia. Without a medical breakthrough this number could grow to
132m by 2050, according to the World Alzheimer’s Report. One
study found that people suﬀering from dementia accounted for
four-ﬁfths of all those in care homes worldwide. 
In the absence of other options, for many people the ulti-
mate insurance is their home, though few homeowners see it
that way. In the rich world much of the wealth of lower and mid-
dle-income households is tucked away in bricks and mortar.
With house prices soaring in many countries, releasing some of
this equity could greatly beneﬁt asset-rich but cash-poor pen-

sioners, as well as the wider economy. 
The most obvious tool for this is a reverse mortgage, which
lets homeowners exchange some of their home’s equity for a
lump sum or a stream of income in retirement. But it is not wide-
ly used. In America fewer than 49,000 reverse mortgages were
sold last year, most of them provided by only about ten banks.
Mis-selling scandals in the early days now seem to have been re-
solved, says Jamie Hopkins, of the American College of Finan-
cial Services, but people ﬁnd such mortgages scary and worry
that they might lose their home. Because of the lack of competi-
tion, the products also remain expensive. Mainstream ﬁnanciers
could help expand the market.
In the meantime, entrepreneurial empty-nesters have
found another way to sweat their assets: Airbnb. The over-60s
are the fastest-growing group of hosts on the home-sharing site
and receive the highest ratings. Almost half of older hosts in Eu-
rope say the additional income helps them stay in their home.
The longer that people live, the more varied their life cycle
will become. Workers will take breaks to look after children or go
back to school; pensioners will take up a new job or start a busi-
ness. Financial providers need to recognise these changing
needs and cater for them. That includes helping to fund technol-
ogy that could vastly improve the ﬁnal stage of life. 7

Technology

Tablets for every
problem

The latest technology is even more beneﬁcial for the
old than for the young

NO MATTER HOW much lifespans are being stretched, the
very last chapter is often grim. From the age of 80, in the
rich world one person in ﬁve will be aﬄicted with some form of
dementia, one in four will suﬀer from vision loss and four in ﬁve
will develop hearing problems. Of those who make it to 90, the
majority will have at least one health problem that counts as a
disability; many will have multiple ones. Unfairly, for poorer
and less well-educated people this decline often starts sooner.
In former times, the old used to spend this ﬁnal, increasing-
ly dependent phase at home, looked after by relatives. Over the
past century, as ageing in the rich world became medicalised,
care for the elderly was outsourced to retirement or nursing

homes (a model that emerging economies such as China are
now beginning to copy). But most old people do not want to live
in institutions for long periods, and the cost of such care is exorbi-
tant. So the new buzz phrase is “ageing in place”.
That is mostly a good thing, but it does carry risks of its own.
An old person’s home may be his castle, but if he suﬀers from
bad balance or tends to leave the cooker on, it can become a
death trap. Another risk is that the shift will undo the progress in
gender equality made in the past few decades. Having to care for
elderly family members is already a prime reason for women to
drop out of work. Just as women have tended to leave their jobs
to care for new babies in their 30s, a second “hole in the pipeline”
is appearing around the age of 50. There is no reason why men
could not provide such care, but typically it is women who are
doing it—though by the age of 75 men in rich countries become
much more likely to do their bit, usually for a spouse. 
Technology holds great promise to make life better for the
elderly, enabling them to retain their independence and live full
lives for longer. Equally important, it can lend a helping hand to
those who care for them and provide peace of mind. And it
should be good for health and care funders because it helps pre-
vent expensive spells in hospitals and care homes. The diﬃculty
lies in deciding who pays. Much of the technology that can im-
prove the last stage of life already exists, but the uncertainty over
funding discourages inventors from pursuing good ideas and
venture capitalists from investing in them. 
Oddly enough, the greatest potential for improving the
lives of the elderly lies in technology built for the young. Two
broad developments that seem a perfect ﬁt for the lives of millen-
nials—the smart home and the on-demand economy—might
well have an even bigger impact on old people.
At ﬁrst sight, Dolf Honée’s tidy brownstone looks like any
other house in a sleepy residential street in Oostvoorne, a town
west of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. But a set of eight sensors
from Sensara, a tech company, have transformed the 87-year-
old’s home into a cyber-castle. His children, all in their 50s, keep
an eye on when he gets out of bed, goes to the toilet, has a meal or
leaves the house, using an app that pings them if anything is
wrong. “They’re always watching me,” jokes Mr Honée, but he
feels safer, he says “without feeling spied on as with cameras.”

The little things than can cause big trouble

Such a fairly basic version of a smart home can make a big
diﬀerence to the growing number of older people who live alone
and wish to stay where they are. Reinout Engelberts, of Sensara,
thinks the main value of such systems is “catching little things be-
fore they become big discomforts and big costs for the provider”.
Increased toilet visits can ﬂag up a urinary-tract infection;
changes in gait can predict an impending fall, the leading cause

of death from injury among older adults. By picking up such
things early, the algorithms can alert the elderly or their caregiv-
ers to the need for simple interventions.
So far most elders experimenting with smart homes or
wearables use only basic tools: sensors in their home or a mon-
itor around their wrist. But it does not take much to imagine a
home where the occupant’s sleep is monitored via a device in his
ear, his fridge suggests what he might eat, based on information
from other monitoring devices, and a pill dispenser can give him
tailored medication. A smart stove switches itself oﬀ if it detects
a ﬁre hazard, and smart pipes turn oﬀ a tap left running. When
the doorbell rings, his smart watch tells him who has arrived. All
the while these data are mined for information that might be
useful for caregivers.
Most of the technology needed to do all this already exists,
at least in prototype form. The hard part is getting providers to
pay for it. In the Netherlands ﬁve insurers now reimburse users
for Sensara’s sensors and the company is in talks with others, in-
cluding the health ministry. Other insurers are experimenting
with reimbursements on wearables. But on the whole providers
are still reluctant to pay for a gizmo today that might prevent a hip
fracture and hospitalisation tomorrow.
One reason for optimism is that the cost of such consumer
products is coming down. Amazon’s Echo, a voice-controlled
digital assistant, answers questions, reads the news, can phone
relatives and control other smart devices such as lights, thermo-
stats and the television on demand. August’s smart lock keeps
track of comings and goings in a home and allows doors to be
opened or locked remotely. Such gadgets were conceived with
young consumers in mind, but could be even more useful for
older people. 
In a mock-up of the connected home of the future in Fra-
mingham, near Boston, Philips, a health-technology company,
displays both its own smart medical devices and the high-street
kind. It aims to bring all of them together and crunch the data
with its predictive analytics tools. One ﬂoor up, in a blast from
the past, phones ring in the call centre for Philips Lifeline, an
alarm system used by 750,000 elderly Americans that features a
pendant with an emergency button. Occasionally a life is saved
this way, but many calls are set oﬀ accidentally. Such pendants
now seem pretty standard stuﬀ, but they did persuade a genera-
tion that grew up oﬄine to adopt wearables for the ﬁrst time. For
their children, it should be an easier sell.
“Facebook may have been built for kids who spend all day
together in the classroom, but the elderly, who could otherwise
become isolated, stand to beneﬁt most,” says Katy Fike, from
Aging2.0, an innovation platform. Encouragingly, over a third of
Americans over 65 use social media and 64% of those between
50 and 65 do, according to Pew Research. Europeans are a bit be-
hind, but the trends are similar.

Technological elves

The other great opportunity is on-demand services. Cars,
grocery deliveries, handymen and concierge doctors at the
swipe of a smartphone could all be a boon to older people.
Boomers are already familiar with these services, so once they
become less mobile they will just use them more. Lyft, a ride-
hailing service, is already trying to recruit older customers by of-
fering senior-friendly ways to book without a smartphone. Trials
have shown that on-demand ride shares can reduce lateness and
no-shows for medical appointments.
On-demand care services could make an even bigger diﬀer-
ence. Traditional care companies are inﬂexible, typically insist-
ing on advance booking in blocks of so many hours. Seth Stern-
berg, a former Google employee, got so frustrated with this that

The Economist July 8th 2017 

S P E C I A L R E P O R T

T H E E C O N O M I C S O F L O N G E V I T Y

he launched Honor, a tech-enabled care company through
which carers can be booked round the clock, via an app, on a
pay-as-you-go basis for whatever time is required. The company
has raised $65m in venture capital and operates in 12 American
cities. Other entrepreneurs are looking at on-demand nurses and
light help in and around the house. Such services would not only
make it easier for elderly people to stay in their homes, but also
provide work for the younger old looking for gigs. The challenge
will be to make the economics stack up. 
Demand for this kind of technology will only increase as
populations age, but unless funding mechanisms can be found, it
will be available only to those who can pay for it outright, thus
increasing inequality. In future doctors might prescribe all kinds
of preventive technology-based services for older people at risk,
just as they prescribe preventive pills today. Government may
well have a role in this, but the obvious funders are insurance
companies: they, too, have much to gain from prevention. 
Encouragingly, in every centre for seniors visited for this re-
port, from New York to Seoul, the most popular classes were in
the use of smartphones and tablets, often sponsored by telecoms
companies who spotted an opportunity. If insurers and health-
care providers do not come up with a funding model, tech and
telecoms companies may eat their lunch. 7

The longevity dividend

A blessing, not a
burden

How to make the most of ageing populations

FOR MOST OF history humans lived only long enough to
ensure the survival of the species. Today babies born in the
West can expect to see their grandchildren have children. With
more time come many more opportunities for work and plea-
sure, enriching individuals, societies and economies alike.
Whether mankind is able to reap this “longevity dividend” will
depend on how those opportunities are used.
By the early 2000s the state of health of American men
aged 69, as reported by themselves, was as good as that of 60-
year-olds in the 1970s; 70 really does seem to be the new 60. This
report has argued that if employers, businesses and ﬁnancial ser-
vices adapt to make far more of such people, big economic bene-

2 ﬁts for everyone could follow. There are striking parallels be-
tween the longevity dividend now in prospect and the gender
dividend that became available when many more women start-
ed to enter the labour market in the 1970s. The last stage of life
could also be greatly improved by letting more people retain
their autonomy, often with the help of technology. 
But for all those beneﬁts to be realised, two things need to
happen. First, employers must adapt to an ageing workforce. Al-
though the gig economy and self-employment have been help-
ful in allowing older people to carry on working, the fact that
they are so widely used suggests that traditional employers are
often insuﬃciently ﬂexible to accommodate this new group. 

The business case

Ageist recruitment practices and corporate cultures can be
big impediments to keeping older workers employed. Nearly
two-thirds of this group surveyed in America said they had wit-
nessed or experienced age discrimination at work, according to
the AARP, a lobby group for the over-50s. Legislation can help,
but the best hope is for employers to recognise that oﬀering op-
portunities to older workers is smart business rather than a so-
cial duty. Academics have found that older people in multi-gen-
eration teams tend to boost the productivity of those around
them, and such mixed teams perform better than single-genera-
tion ones. Companies that have taken this advice to heart, such
as Deutsche Bank, report fewer mistakes and positive feedback
between young and old.
As one of the world’s oldest countries, Germany oﬀers oth-
er encouraging examples. “It used to hurt in all the usual spots,”
says Andreas Schupan, grabbing his back, elbows and shoulders.
Aged 47, he has worked on a production line at BMW, a carmaker,
for over 20 years. Now a computerised cart does most of the lift-
ing for him, and he hopes to stay on for another 20 years. 
The second thing that needs to happen is for the beneﬁts of
longer, healthier lives to be spread much more equitably. As
things stand, greater longevity is something of a lottery that fa-
vours the well-oﬀ and the well-educated. Not only do people in
the rich world live signiﬁcantly longer than those in poor coun-
tries, but huge diﬀerences in lifespan persist even among rich-
country dwellers. In America the diﬀerence in mortality rates
among those with and without a college degree has been widen-
ing for the past 20 years.

Across the OECD, the aver-
age highly educated 25-year-old
man can expect to live eight
years longer than a contempo-
rary with only a basic education
(see chart, previous page). In Brit-
ain a baby girl born between
2012 and 2014 in Richmond, a
wealthy area in south-west Lon-
don, is not only likely to live 3.4
years longer than her equivalent
in Tower Hamlets, a run-down
part of east London; she will also
enjoy 14.5 more years in good
health, estimates Britain’s Oﬃce
for National Statistics. 
The causes of such gaps in
life chances between haves and
have-nots are well known.
Smoking, obesity, air pollution,
drugs and alcohol consumption
all have a strong, and in some
cases growing, inﬂuence on dif-
ferences in life expectancy with-
in countries, says Fabrice Murtin
of the OECD. The best way to lev-
el the playing ﬁeld is to invest in
public health, oﬀer universal ac-
cess to health care and provide
high-quality
education 
for
everyone. Unsurprisingly, 
in
countries such as Canada or
Sweden, which attach great importance to such matters, the gap
in life expectancy between the most and the least educated peo-
ple is much narrower than it is in America. 
Individuals will also have to take more responsibility for
unlocking their own longevity dividend. In a survey of Ameri-
cans conducted by researchers at Stanford University, 77% of re-
spondents said they wanted to live to 100, but only 42% claimed
to be making a real eﬀort to get there. 
Given the right input from governments, employers and in-
dividuals, it should be possible to stretch the increasingly pro-
ductive in-betweener stage and compress
the dependent period at the very end of
life. But that last stage will always remain
costly, and the state will probably contin-
ue to pick up most of the tab. 
Estimates of life expectancy over re-
cent decades have regularly proved too
conservative. Some demographers al-
ready think that children born in the rich
world today will routinely make it to 100.
With vast sums being pumped into ﬁelds
such as stem-cell research, regenerative
medicine, biomedical technology and ge-
nomics, human lives could stretch well
beyond that. If that happened rapidly, it
could prove highly disruptive. Economies
would suﬀer, social tensions could erupt
and progress on gender equality might be
reversed as many more women were ob-
liged to become caregivers for the elderly.
To avoid such ill eﬀects, societies and
economies must start in earnest to pre-
pare for those longer lives right now. 7

Mostminesare mature (Drie-fontein is65 yearsold), and the costof ex-tractingthe gold maysoon exceed its value.Illegal minersknown as“zama-zamas”(“takingchances”) are anotherproblem,undeterred bythe extreme depthsandhigh-tech security. AtSibanye’snearbyCooke mine, a recentwildcatstrike had theunexpected side-eﬀectofﬂushingout 461zama-zamaswho were beingabetted by le-gitimate miners. Nash Lutchman ofSiba-nyeestimatesthatroughly3.5-4% ofgoldproduction acrossall ofthe company’sop-erationsislostto illegal miners. Industrywide, theypilfersome 20 billion rand(about$1.5bn) a year. Sibanye’stactical re-sponse team hasfaced gunﬁre and evengrenadeswhile chasingafterzama-zamas.South Africa’sminingindustryisshrinking. Atitspeakin 1980, miningac-counted fora ﬁfth ofthe country’sGDP; thenumbernowstandsat7.3%. High costs, lowcommodityprices, labourstrife and fallingproductivityhave all taken theirtoll.Mineshave shed 70,000 jobsoverthe pastﬁve years. More cutsare coming. Anglo-Gold Ashanti, a gold-mininggiant, lastweekannounced plansto layoﬀ8,500workers, a third ofitsSouth African work-force. AtSibanye, manyofthe zama-zamasare formerminerswho return to workun-derground forpowerful syndicates.Miningﬁrmsare also beinghurtby gov-ernmentpolicies. Anewminingcharter in-troduced lastmonth bySouth Africa’smin-ingminister, Mosebenzi Zwane, wouldforce companiesto ensure thatatleast 30%oftheirsharesare in blackhands, up fromthe currentminimum of26%. Underthenewcharter, companieswould be re-quired to maintain thislevel ofblack own-ership regardlessofwhetherblackinves-torssell out. Theywould also have to payoutatleast1% oftheirturnovereach year totheirblackshareholders. Had thisrulebeen in eﬀectin 2016, blackshareholderswould have got5.8bn rand ofthe total of5.9bn rand paid asdividends, leavingal-mostnothingforanyone else, notestheChamberofMinesofSouth Africa.The industry’stop brassremain mostlywhite; workerstoilingin the minesarenearlyall black. The governmentclaims tobe outraged aboutthis; perhapsthisex-plainswhyitdrafted the newrulesin suchahurry, withoutbotheringto consult min-ingﬁrms. WhereasSouth Africa’sﬁrst-everminingcharter, introduced in 2004 and re-vised sixyearslater, wasthe product ofex-tensive talkswith the industry, the newruleswere simplyhanded down. Theyare also hard to understand. TheChamberofMineshasgone to courtseek-ingto blockthe charter, callingit“so con-fusingand confused, and so contradictoryin itscore provisions”, thatithasleftmin-ingcompaniesand legal expertsper-plexed. The chamber’sCEO, RogerBaxter,arguesthatthe newruleswould deter in-vestmentand putup to 100,000 miningjobsatrisk. The charter’srelease triggered asell-oﬀofSouth African miningstocks. Adrawn-outlegal battle islooming, whichmeansmore uncertainty.South Africa isalreadya tough sell. In a2016 surveyofattractivenessto mining in-vestors, the FraserInstitute, a free-marketthink-tank, ranked South Africa 74th of104miningjurisdictions, well behind neigh-bouringBotswana (19th), Namibia (53rd)and manyotherAfrican countries. Mean-while South Africa dipped into a recessionlastquarter, and oﬃcial unemploymenthasreached a 14-yearhigh at27.7%.Addingto the confusion are diﬀeringmessagesfrom MrZwane and otherseniormembersofhisparty, the African NationalCongress(ANC), which isdeeplydividedasitpreparesto electnewleadersin De-cember. The charterischampioned byPresidentJacob Zuma and hissupporters,who have backed populistpoliciesunderthe guise of“radical economictransforma-tion”, perhapsto distractpublicattentionfrom a growingmountain ofcorruptionscandals. The deputypresident, Cyril Ra-maphosa, a formerunion leaderturnedbusinessman who isseekingto succeed MrZuma, leadsa separate faction thathascalled forthe newcharterto be reconsid-ered. The policyuncertaintywill probablyonlyend with change atthe top. 7South African miningDeep troubleWESTONARIAThe mining industryfaces tough times, made worse byfoolish policiesSome toil to mine gold; others just write lawsawayfrom Dubai’sgiantportofJebel Ali.With little cash ofhisown, the Sultan islet-tingChinese managersexpand Duqm, hisnewIndian Ocean port, in exchange for$10bn ofinvestmentearmarked forChi-nese companies.Buttensionswith Qataralso makeOmanisnervous.

European and Chinese leaderswere passingthrough Berlin forprepara-torytalksahead ofthe annual G20 summitoflarge economies, which thisyeartakesplace in Hamburgfrom July7th. AweekearlierAngela Merkel lambasted the isola-tionism and protectionism ofDonaldTrump’sAmerica in a speech to the Bun-destag. Once MrKohl’sprotégée, the chan-cellorofhisreuniﬁed Germanyissome-timesdubbed the “leaderofthe freeworld” in the Anglo-Saxon media.Yetsuch epithetsgetthingswrong. Tounderstand why, lookatGermany’srela-tionswith Africa, Poland and America.The ﬂummeryisnotall misplaced. MrsMerkel isthe mostrespected (see chart)and longest-servingofthe main worldleaders. Germany’sneweconomicpre-eminence hasgiven itthe leadingrole inEurope. The scarsofits20th-centuryhis-toryare healing, and itisbecomingmoreassertive: havinggotused to foreign mili-tarydeploymentin Afghanistan, ithasnowbroadened into newmissionsin Maliand Lithuania.

Itismuch smaller, and haslittle mili-tarypower. Its“Marshall Plan” vastlyover-statesitscapacity. German oﬃcials in WestAfrica have been told to stop usingtheterm. Developmentwork“won’tcurb thenumbersofmigrants”, admitsone. Berlin’seﬀortswill be insigniﬁcantunlessotherspitch in, too. ThusMrsMerkel intends touse the G20 to win alliesforherplan. SuchdiplomacyisGermany’sgreatstrength. Forexample, itwasPoland thatﬁrstargued forEuropean sanctionson Russia foritsinter-ference in Ukraine in 2014, butMrsMerkelwho made them happen.Nevertheless, Berlin’srelationswithWarsaware terrible. Poland’spopulistLawand Justice governmentusesGermany(and especiallyitsliberal refugee policy) asabogeyman and ridesroughshod overdemocraticnorms. The Polesevoke thesecond world warto mobilise anti-Ger-man sentiment. Such memoriesstill dis-suade Berlin from takingthe lead on Euro-pean issues, until leadership vacuumsforce itto. Duringthe migrantcrisis, Berlinwastoo slowto askforco-operation fromthe Poles, who, afterLawand Justice tookpowerin 2015, refused to acceptanyrefu-gees. When the European Union insisted,Poland ignored it. And thisfrom a countryeconomicallydependenton Germany. With America, MrsMerkel maysoundasifshe isboldlyrejectingTrumpism. (Eu-rope should relylesson the United Statesforitssecurityand should pressaheadwith globalisation, she told a crowd in Mu-nich in May.) Butmuch ofthisisfor domes-ticconsumption. MrTrump iswildlyun-popularin Germany, and the chancellor ispreparingforan election in September. Inanycase, commitmentsto multilateralismand free trade are uncontroversial in Ger-many, “the ultimate statusquo power”, dence isits“Marshall Plan forAfrica”.Named afterthe American scheme thatpumped moneyinto Europe afterthe sec-ond world war, thisprogramme ofaid andprivate investmenttakesaim atthe rootcausesofthe refugee crisis.

Thatwasone ofthe bigquestionsasleadersofthe world’slargesteconomiesgathered forthe G20 meetinginHamburgon July7th and 8th. DonaldTrump’spromise thatAmerica will pullouthasweakened the deal. Manyfearthatothercountries’ future pledgesto cutgreenhouse-gasemissionswill be less am-bitiouswithoutthe world’ssecond-largestpolluter(afterChina) doingitsshare.YetAmerica’sdeparture hasgalvanisedChina, which promotesitselfasa champi-on ofthe deal—and Europe, which thinksitselfin the vanguard ofgreenery. If theyremain staunch, reluctantconvertssuch asSaudi Arabia and Turkeyare more likely tostaythe course. The G20 meetingwasjustbeginningasThe Economistwentto press,butlayingoutthe nextstepsforthe agree-mentwason the agenda. Europe hasalwaysplayed an outsizedrole in the climate-change debate. It wasaSwedish scientistwho, in 1896, ﬁrstpositedalinkbetween surface temperaturesandthe concentration ofcarbon dioxide in theatmosphere. Acenturylaterthe EuropeanUnion’senvironmentministers(who atthe time numbered amongtheirmembersone Angela Merkel) adopted the aim ofkeepingglobal warmingto below2°C. Foryearsthe European Union hassetpoliciesto curb emissionsand discourage energyuse (see chart). Germanyisswitching to re-newablesin a massive “energytransition”.The Parisagreement, which sawmore than190 countriespledge to keep global warm-ingto “well below” thatthreshold, was atriumph ofGallicdiplomacy. Atleast, so goesthe boosterish storyEuropeanstell themselves. In fact, the EU’sstated goal ofa 40% cutin greenhouse-gasemissionsby2030, asmeasured againstlevelsin 1990, isinadequate ifitisto do itsshare in keepingglobal warmingbelow2°C. Itspoliciesforelectricitygenerationhave misﬁred, too. True, subsidieshaveboosted wind and solarpower, and byaround 2030 these will become the EU’slargestsource ofpowergeneration, accord-ingto the International EnergyAgency. Butthathashad two perverse consequences.The ﬁrstislowerwholesale electricityprices, meaningsqueezed revenuesandlowerinvestment. The second isrising im-portsoffossil fuelsto keep the lights onwhen the sun ishidden and the windsarestill. Together, these have meanta heavy re-liance on plantsburningcheap-but-dirtyfuelssuch asbrown coal. Europe’sshiftawayfrom nuclearpower, which gener-atesno carbon dioxide, hasmade reducingemissionsharder—especiallyin Germany,which decided in a panicto close all 17 ofitsnuclearplantsafterthe Fukushima melt-down in Japan.Natural gascould provide a bridge be-tween a smoggypastand a clean future.Butsuppliesdepend on a hostile Russia,which providesabouta third ofthe EU’sto-tal. Thatshare would rise underplans forNord Stream 2, a proposed Russian pipe-line. And though natural gasemitsless car-bon dioxide than coal, itisnottruly green.Carbon dioxide staysin the atmosphereformore than 500 years; methane, themain constituentofnatural gas, lingers forabout12 butcan be 25 timesmore potent.No long-term environmental plan can relyheavilyon it. The EU EmissionsTradingScheme hasalso fallen short. Afterthe ﬁ-nancial crisisof2007-08, there wasa glutofcarbon permits. Priceshave dropped byfour-ﬁfthssince then, to around €5 ($5.67)pertonne. To help the planetmuch, theywould have to be €40 orso. Some lessonshave been learned frompastfailures. From 2021on, the numberofcarbon permitsissupposed to be cut. Presi-dentEmmanuel Macron wantsto setaminimum price of€30 pertonne in Francein the hope thatothercountrieswill fol-low.

Aswell asmanag-inglegislative disputesbetween the EU’s28 governments, Esto-nia will spend the nextsixmonthspressingitsvision upon therestofthe club, which, itfears, maybe leftbehind by more digital-lyastute policymakersin otherpartsofthe world.

MrAnsip says thatgroupsofEU governmentsmayneed to move ahead with data-sharinginitiativesratherthan waitingforall the laggards to agree. Vested interestsand distracted politicianshave often limitedEurope’sambitionson digital matters. Havingregained their self-conﬁdence, Europe’sleadersare seekingfresh ideasto boostgrowth. The EUhaslongpaid homage to the potential ofthe digi-tal economy, and Estonia’spresidencyoﬀersthem a chance tomake thisword ﬂesh. “We are on the brinkofan ideological shiftin the restofthe EU,” saysMsKaljulaid.

Then the gov-ernmentannounced thatitwould cap an-nual public-sectorpayincreasesatan aver-age of1% until 2020.The cap hasbeen blamed forall man-nerofills, from diﬃcultiesin recruitingteachersto nursesbeingforced to use foodbanks. In recentweeksthe heroism of ﬁre-ﬁghtersatthe Grenfell Towerdisaster andunarmed police oﬃcersﬁghtingterroristshasmade the stinginessseem especiallymean.

Despite astream ofarticlesabout“public-sectorfatcats”, publicservantsin the top earningsdecile have seen theirsalariesfall by about2% since 2011, the mostofany. Areport lastyearfrom the IMF drilycommended Brit-ain for“strictermonitoringand control ofapproval forsalariesabove thatoftheprime minister.”With the public-paypremium still fairlyhealthy, the publicsectorhasfaced lesstrouble recruitingstaﬀthan iscommonlysupposed.

The gov-ernmentannounced the 1% cap ata timewhen inﬂation wasclose to zero. Now, in-ﬂation isnearly3%, meaningthatthe cap isimposingreal-termscutsin pay. Private-sectorworkersare also expectingmeaslypaygrowth in the comingyears, in part be-cause ofhigherinﬂation, butthe squeezeon them islesssevere. On currenttrends, therefore, the public-sectorwage premium maysoon reach itslowestlevel in atleasttwo decades.

TheMigration AdvisoryCommittee, an oﬃcialexpertpanel, recentlyrecommended wid-eningthe numberofsubjectsforwhichschoolscould recruitfrom outside Europe.So justasin the early2000s, the govern-mentmaybefore longhave little choice butto boostpublic-sectorpay.

Butthe island nation hasgreataﬀection foritsﬂeet. Duringlastyear’sBrexitreferendumcampaign, a ﬂotilla oftrawlermensteamed up the Thamesto protestagainstEuropean Union ﬁshingquotas. On July2nd Michael Gove, the Brexiteerenviron-mentsecretary(who claimsthathisfa-ther’sAberdeen ﬁsh businesswassunk byEUrules), announced thatBritain would“take backcontrol” ofitswatersbyunilat-erallywithdrawingfrom an internationalﬁshingtreaty.Guttingsuch agreementsisstronglysupported bycoastal communities. Thepro-Brexitpresscheered MrGove’sboldannouncement. Butlandinga newdeal forBritish ﬁshermen will be legallycomplex,expensive to enforce, oblige Britain to ob-serve European rulesthatithashad nohand in settingand, mostlikely, leave itsbusinessesand consumersworse oﬀthanbefore. Itis, in otherwords, a case studyofthe Brexitnegotiationsasa whole.The EU’sCommon FisheriesPolicy(CFP) wasdrawn up before Britain joined,to itsdisadvantage. Butmembership hasallowed Britain to improve the policy.Countries’ quotasare nowseton a basisthatismore scientiﬁcthan political. Un-wanted ﬁsh can no longerbe discarded atsea, which hashelped to reverse the deple-tion ofstocks.Unpickingdecadesoftangled legalagreementswill be harderthan itlooks. MrGove hasinitiated Britain’swithdrawalfrom the London FisheriesConvention.ButMichel Barnier, the European Commis-sion’sBrexitnegotiator, arguesthatthis1964 agreementhassince been supersededbythe CFP. Regardlessofthese conven-tions, foreign ﬁshermen mayclaim historicﬁshingrightsgoingbackdecadesorevencenturies. Manyofthem have setup unitsin Britain to buyquotasfrom British ﬁsher-men.

In the pastthe EU hasrespondedto ﬁshingdisputeswith Norwayand theFaroe islandsbybanningall imports.

Athird ofitcomesfrom the EU,and British ﬁshermen netabouta sixth oftheirtotal catch in French, Belgian, Dutch,Danish orIrish waters.

Thisignoresthe factthatmillennials have suﬀeredmore from the longstagnation thatfollowed the ﬁnancial crisisthan anyothergeneration. Theyhave reason to be angry.The mostintelligentexplanation hasbeen provided by JohnGrayin the NewStatesman. MrGrayarguesthatCorbynism is“populism forthe middle classes, servingthe material and psy-chological needsofthe relativelyaﬄuentand the well-heeled”.Farfrom beinga repudiation ofTonyBlair’spolicies, Corbynismrepresentsthe completion ofthe takeoverofLabourbymiddle-classpeople who puttheirown interests(such asfree universityeducation) above those ofthe workingclass. ButMrGray’sstric-turesmissan importantpoint: mostyoungCorbynistasare notsomuch settled membersofthe middle classasfrustrated would-bemembers.

Thirty-year-old millennialsare one-thirdlesslikelyto own theirown homesthan babyboomerswere atthe same age, and spend £44,000 ($58,000) more on rentin their20sthan babyboomersdid. The problem then extendsto theworkplace.

The IMF hasdescribedregulators’ expectationsasoften “unclear,inconsistentlycommunicated [and] un-evenlyimplemented”.Until recently, regulatorsmostly ig-nored complaintsaboutcollateral damage.Buttheyhave started to come in formorecriticism.

Afterspendingseveralmonthsunderhouse arrestin late 2014,VladimirYevtushenkov, a Russian oli-garch, relinquished control ofBashneft, amidsized oil ﬁrm, to the state. “Ifyoulikeanothercompanytomorrowand wanttotake it, youare welcome,” he told VladimirPutin atthe time, he laterrecalled. Thepresidentpubliclygave hisapproval to Sis-tema, MrYevtushenkov’sconglomerate,sharesin which had plunged.

Late lastyear, Rosneftpur-chased Bashneftfrom the state for$5.3bn. ItnowclaimsthatSistema inappropriatelytookassetsin a restructuringofBashneft.

TheBritish government’splan to leave the EUbyMarch 2019 meansthatthe countrywillprobablyexitthe European Common Avi-ation Area (asan expanded version of thatinitial aviation marketisknown). Contin-ued membership would require accep-tance ofEuropean courtjurisdiction, a “redline” forBritish negotiators. Without a newagreementto replace it, ﬂightsbetweenBritain and the EUmighthave to stop en-tirely, saysMichael O’Leary, the chiefexec-utive ofRyanair.Otherairline executivesdo notthink acomplete stop in ﬂightsison the cards.

ButMrO’Learyisrightto worry. Brexitislikelyto create a worse environment formanyEuropean airlines. Growingrates ofmigration amongyoungpeople in the blochave boosted revenues.

TheﬂagcarriersofFrance and Germany, whichhave a close relationship with theirrespec-tive governments, have everyincentive tomake sure thatrivalsare caughtbyrulesthatban foreign airlinesfrom ﬂying withinthe EU, saysAndrewCharlton ofAviationAdvocacy, a consultancy. In FebruaryLufthansa’sCEO, Carsten Spohr, said hewill oppose anyattemptbyeasyJetor Brit-ish Airwaysto re-enterthe European Com-mon Aviation Area afterBrexit. Even ifan interim deal isreached tocontinue ﬂightsbetween Britain and theEU, itispossible thatRyanairwill be pre-vented from ﬂyingwithin Britain and thateasyJet, a British carrier, will be unable toﬂywithin the EU. In March 2019 theymayeach have to splitthemselvesinto a British-registered ﬁrm and one based in the EU.The LCCsare famouslyﬂexible. Theycan move aircraftaround theirnetworks inawaythatlegacycarriersthatbase theiroperationsaround speciﬁchub airportscannot. Thissortofresponse enables themto respond to temporarydisruptions. But ifBritain cannotforge a deal to replace theEuropean Common Aviation Area, therewill be fewerairlineson manyroutes.

Risk-management, com-pliance, information-technologyand oth-eroperationsnowconcentrated in Londonwill have to be duplicated, albeiton asmallerscale, elsewhere in Europe. A studypublished on July3rd bythe AssociationforFinancial Marketsin Europe, a tradebody, the Boston ConsultingGroup and gotiated in time, will plainlynotsuﬃce.TheCityUK, a trade body, hasbeen arguingfora bespoke deal forﬁnancial services,comprisingmutual recognition ofregula-tionswith the EU-27, transitional arrange-mentsto avoid a post-Brexitcrunch and“mutual accessto talent”, so thatLondonwill still attractbankers, ﬁntech entrepre-neursand others.Bankersthinkthatsince Britain’sgen-eral election on June 8th, when TheresaMay’sConservativeslosttheirparliamen-tarymajority, a softish Brexit, with a gra-dual shiftto a newrelationship, has be-come more likely. More business-friendlymembersofthe governmentthan MrsMay, such asPhilip Hammond, the chan-cellor, sound more conﬁdent.

Butuntil now thepoliticallytouchybusinessofrunning pen-sionshas, like taxation, been zealouslyguarded bynational governments. No lon-ger: on June 29th the European Commis-sion presented a long-awaited proposal forapan-European personal-pension pro-duct, the snazzilynamed “Pepp”.Anyattemptto encourage Europeans tomake adequate provision fortheirold ageiswelcome. The combination ofageingpopulations, fallingbirth ratesand gener-ousstate pensionscould leave future gen-erationsfootingthe bill, unlesspeopleworkforlonger. Especiallyin countriessuch asItalyand Greece, where the state isthe main pension provider, encouragingpeople to make personal savingsfortheirretirementwould be sensible (see thisweek’sspecial report). Europe’spension landscape isfrag-mented. In some countries, citizenshaveplentyofproductsto choose from; othershave veryfew. ApatchworkofEuropeanand national rules, and divergenttax treat-ments, hasmeantpension potstend to sitin national silos. The commission hopesthatthe newproductswill both help sav-ersand provide an extra potofmoney toboostinvestmentin Europe. Indeed, thecommission reckonsthattoday’stotal per-sonal-pensionssavingsof€700bn($794bn) could exceed €2trn by2030, ofwhich €700bn would be in Peppsalone.The idea isthata Peppstrademarkwould provide reassurance aboutthequalityofthese products, which could besold byinsurers, pension funds, asset man-agersand banksacrossthe EU. Thatshouldbringincreased cross-bordercompetition,leadingto simplerand cheaperproductsforsavers. The pensionswould be porta-ble, makingiteasierto continue to save forsomeone who movesjobsorcountriesorboth. Consumerswould have more choicethan theydo todayand providerscouldﬁsh in a pond of240m (the estimated sizeofthe EU’sworking-age population).Butcriticsthinkthe idea fallsshort ofwhatisneeded. Peppsmerelybroadenwhatisavailable to those choosingvolun-tary, private savingsplans. Collective andsemi-mandatoryplansare arguablymoreimportant, butare nottouched. In coun-triesthatrelyheavilyon state-funded pen-sionsand where traditionsofsavingfor re-tirementare weak, these productsmightmake little diﬀerence. Taxtreatment couldalso prove a hurdle. The commission canmerelyrecommend, notmandate, thatPeppsare aﬀorded the same favourable taxtreatmentthatgovernmentsgive to theirown national products. FornowPeppsare mostlikelyto appealto a limited numberofgroups, such as mo-bile professionals, the self-employed andthose livingin underserved markets, nota-blyin eastern Europe. The announcementis, however, a victoryforthe EU’s“capital-marketsunion” (CMU), a projectto reduceEuropean dependence on bankﬁnanceand to ease the ﬂowofcapital across thecontinent. Much ofthe progressso faron CMU—such asliberalisingrulesforventure-capi-tal fundsand makingiteasierforsmallﬁrmsto liston stockexchanges—counts forlesswithoutnewpoolsofcapital to tapinto.

The ECBisnotaboutto stop itsstimulus. He thinksthat, in September, the bankwill merelyindicate thatitwill be reducingits month-lyrate ofpurchasesfrom €60bn ($68bn) to€40bn atthe startof2018. MrDraghi isjustpreparingthe ground.There wassome speculation thatcen-tral bankshad deliberatelyco-ordinatedtheircomments. Butthe simplerexplana-tion isthattheywere reactingto similarfactors. First, global growth seemshavepicked up in the second halfof2016, allow-ingbanksto withdrawsome stimulus.

Haste ishandy: the EU wantedsuccessbefore Brexitnegotiationsand na-tional electionsswamp itsagenda. The deal isaboutmore than politicalsymbolism, however.

Theyare a meansto limitsevere povertyamongthose in work. Yettheyalso attractopposition from criticswho see wage min-imumsasprice controlsthatdiscourage ﬁrmsfrom hiring asmanyworkersastheyotherwise might. Fordecades, feudingcampsofdismal scientistshave tussled overwhetherthe gooddone byminimum wagesoutweighsthe bad. Aseriesofrecentminimum-wage increasesin America will shine a lighton thatquestion and othersaswell. Indeed, the time mayhave come foreconomiststo broaden theirviewofjustwhata minimum wageismeantto accomplish. Asvoterfrustration atstagnantpayhasgrown, politicians onthe American lefthave spotted an opportunityto courtpopular-itybycallingforhigherminimum wages. Democratsare unitedbehind a demand fora national minimum wage of$15 an hour,more than double the current$7.25 rate. State legislaturesin Cali-fornia and NewYorkhave enacted lawsthatgraduallyraise theirminimum wagesto $15. Fewgovernments, however, have movedasaggressivelyasthe cityofSeattle. In 2014 the council voted toraise the minimum wage, the hourlyrate setbythe state ofWash-ington, then $9.32, to $11an hourfrom April 2015, followed byfur-therrises, to $13 in January2016 and $15 in Januarythisyear.Smallerﬁrmsand those thatprovide beneﬁtson top of payweregiven longerto implementthe changes.On the surface, Seattle’seconomyseemsto have weatheredthe increaseswell—indeed, to have beneﬁted from them. Sincethe initial rise, in April 2015, the unemploymentrate in the sur-roundingarea hasfallen from 4.3% to 3.3% and employmenthasgrown strongly. An analysispublished in June bythe Centre onWage and EmploymentDynamicsatthe UniversityofCalifor-nia, Berkeley, compared employmentin the food-services indus-tryin Seattle with thatin the same industryin comparable areaselsewhere overthe period ofthe ﬁrsttwo increases(to $11andthen $13). Itconcluded that, despite increased wagesin the indus-tryin Seattle, there wasno detectable eﬀecton employment.Anotherrecentanalysis, however, bya team from the Univer-sityofWashington, arrivesata verydiﬀerentconclusion. Itsau-thorsuse data thatare notpubliclyavailable, on wages earnedand hoursworked byindividuals. Theyalso ﬁnd thatthe increasein the minimum wage to $11seemsnotto have had much ofan ef-fecton employment.

There are limi-tationsto the data, asthe authorsthemselvesadmit, and thisishardlythe lastword on the subject. ElasticbandsButthese studiesraise otherpressingquestions. Another wayoflookingatthe eﬀectofhigherwageson employmentisby calcu-latingwhateconomistscall the “elasticityofemployment” withrespectto wages: thatis, byhowmuch employmentchanges foragiven change in the wage. Moststudiesﬁnd an elasticity ofaround zero, meaningthatwhateveremploymentchangesoccurin response to a minimum-wage change, positive ornegative,theyare relativelysmall. The UniversityofWashington team, incontrast, ﬁndsthatin movingfrom $11perhourto $13 the elasticitywasclose to -3: thatis, small jumpsin the wage led to freakishlylarge declinesin employment. Subsequentstudiesshould pro-vide cluesabouthowrobustthatﬁndingis. Iftrue, however, itsuggeststhatﬁrmscan more easilyadjusttheirbusiness modelsto reduce the role oflow-wage labourthan waspreviously be-lieved: byautomating, perhaps, orbyeliminatingjobsthat werenotparticularlynecessaryin the ﬁrstplace.Forpoliticianslookingto improve the fortunesoflow-paidworkers, signsthathigherminimum wageslead to job losses willsuggestthatothertools, such aswage subsidies, mustbe relied onmore heavily. Butanotherquestion mightalso be asked. Ifwork-erscan ﬁnd employmentonlyata lowwage, issocietyactuallybetterforhavingthose jobs? Tensofmillionsofworkers fall intosuch categories. Nearly13m American workers, forexample, areemployed in food preparation. The BureauofLabourStatistics re-portstheirmedian hourlywage isjust$10 an hour. If, athigherminimum wages, some ofthese low-wage work-ersend up beingunemployed, thatispersonallyand socially de-structive. Butifresearch suggeststhatlarge numbersof workerscan ﬁnd jobsonlyifwagesare lowenough to discourage ﬁrmsfrom automation, orto encourage them to create unnecessaryjobs, then the rightbalance between a minimum wage and otherincome-boostingmeasuresmightnotbe the bigconcern. Instead,politiciansneed to thinkharderabouthowto prepare workersforhigher-paid, higher-productivityjobs—or, failingthat, howtohelp them contribute in rolesoutside paid private-sector work. 7Wage againstthe machineCloudy skiesSource: NBER Working Paper 23,532*Large, single-site establishmentsNumber of jobs in Seattle*, Q2 2014=100Q2Q3Q42014Q1Q2Q3Q415Q1Q2Q3165060708090100110Minimum wage increasesfrom $9.47 to $11Under$19 per hourMinimum wage increasesfrom $11 to $13Under$13 per hourRising minimum wages mayforce economists to face some hard labour-markettruthsFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchangeThe EconomistJuly8th201765For daily analysis and debate on science andtechnology, visitEconomist.com/science1THE pill-sized camerasin today’smobilephonesmayseem miraculouslytiny,given thata decade ago the smallestcam-erasavailable forretail sale were the size ofapackofcards. ButAli Hajimiri ofthe Cali-fornia Institute ofTechnologyisunim-pressed. In hisopinion even these phonecamerasare fartoo thick(witnessthe opti-cal bump on the backofmostmobilephones), so he and histeam plan to replacethem with trulyminuscule devicesthatspurn everyaspectofcurrentphoto-graphictechnology. Notonlydo DrHaji-miri’scamerashave no movingparts, theyalso lacklensesand mirrors—in otherwords, theyhave no conventional optics.Thatdoesawaywith the focal depth re-quired bytoday’scameras, enablingthenewdevicesto be ﬂat. The result, he hopes,will be the future ofphotography. Brave words. But, asan inventor, DrHa-jimiri hasform to backthem up. In 2002 hehelped found a ﬁrm (nowtaken overby abiggerone) to build powerampliﬁers formobile phones. More than 250m ofthesehave been made. In 2004 he came up withthe world’sﬁrstradaron a chip, which isnowbeingused in prototype self-drivingcars. To round thingsoﬀ, in 2012 he createdan all-silicon imagingsystem thatuses theterahertzpartofthe electromagnetic spec-trum (which isslightlyhigherin frequencythan radar) to see through objectsopaqueto light. Thissystem hasfound employ-fectiscreated bymanipulatingthe light col-lected bythe gratingcouplerselectronical-ly, usingdevicescalled photodiodes. Theseplace varyingdensitiesofelectronsintothe ampliﬁed light’spath through the OPA,eitherslowingitdown orspeedingit up asittravels. Thatshiftsthe arrival times ofthepeaksand troughsofthe lightwaves. This“phase shifting” resultsin constructive in-terference between wavesarrivingfromthe desired direction, which ampliﬁesthem. Lightcomingfrom otherdirections,bycontrast, iscancelled through destruc-tive interference. Change the pattern ofelectronsand youchange the partoftheimage ﬁeld the OPAislookingat. Scanningthe entire ﬁeld in thiswaytakesabout tennanoseconds(billionthsofa second).The photodiodes, then, determinewhere the camera ispointingwithoutanymechanical movementbeingneeded.Theyalso permitthe camera to capture dif-ferentkindsofimages, such asclose-upsand ﬁsh-eye views. To zoom in foraclose-up, the device selectsa speciﬁc partofthe image and scansitmore thoroughly.To zoom outfora ﬁsh-eye, itscansthe en-tire optical ﬁeld, includinglightfrom theedgesofthatﬁeld. To change from zoom toﬁsh-eye takesnanoseconds.The processed optical signal isthenpassed down the waveguide to furtherphotodiodes. These convertitinto an elec-trical signal, which isused to create the ﬁ-nal photo. Crucially, all thiscan beachieved in a stackofelectronicsﬁve mi-cronsthick—abouta ﬁfteenth ofthe diame-terofa human hair. The exactsize ofanyproduction ver-sion will depend on the job to be done. Theprototype can manage fuzzyimagesofbar-codes, butnotmuch else. To achieve thesame resolution asthe camera in a modernApple iPhone, DrHajimiri reckonsan arraymentin everythingfrom medical-diagnos-ticsequipmentto securityscanners. The latestventure moveshisfocus tohigherfrequenciesstill than terahertzwaves—those ofvisible light. The newcamera, known asan optical phased-arrayreceiver, orOPA, collectsthe lightfromwhich itformsitsimage usinga grid ofde-vicescalled gratingcouplers. The proto-type (the blue structure pictured above, at-tached to a thickmountingblockto make iteasierto handle) has64 ofthem. Gratingcouplersare optical antennae. Theycollectlightand send itto a device called a wave-guide. Thiscarrieslightaround in a wayanalogousto a wire carryingelectricity.Flash, bang, wallop. Whata pictureEach gratingcoupleristiny—aboutﬁve bytwo microns(millionthsofa metre)—andso picksup onlya minuscule amountoflight. Thatsignal hasto be ampliﬁed. Thisisdone byheterodyning, a processwhichcombinesthe lightin the couplerwith aminute laserbeam, strengtheningthe sig-nal atthe desired wavelength.

Allowingforthe space between these,the resultwould, atthe moment, have anarea of1cm2. Thisissimilarto the area ofaniPhone’scamera, butthatcamera is1,000timesthicker. DrHajimiri thinks, more-over, thata production version ofthe newdevice would be smaller.He concedesthatthere are challenges:improvingthe optical performance oftheelements; suppressingspillovereﬀects be-tween diﬀerentsignalsin the device; andhoningthe algorithmsthatcalibrate thecamera’sperformance. Butall these mat-ters, he believes, can be dealtwith and heenvisageshislenslesscamerasbeingcom-merciallyavailable within ﬁve years.Such tinycameraswould have uses farbeyond eliminatingthe optical bumpsfrom mobile phones.

In the modernera, such fermentation hasextended itsrange. Carefullyselected mouldschurnoutantibiotics.

AlshakimNelson, a chemistatthe UniversityofWashington, in Seattle, and histeam, pro-pose to change all that. Theyhave devel-oped a bioreactorthatnotonlykeeps bugsalive and active formonthsata time, butcan also be made in minutes, usinglow-costchemicalsand a 3Dprinter.DrNelson’sbioreactorsare composedofa substance called a hydrogel, which isabout70% water. The remaining30% isaspecial polymer, infused with yeast. Un-like edible jelly, which, asparentsof smallchildren will know, breaksinto tinylumpswhen squeezed, DrNelson’shydrogel hasaconsistencyresemblingpeanutbutter.Thatpermitsitto be extruded smoothlythrough the nozzle ofa 3Dprinter. DrNelson’steam have builta printerspeciﬁcallydesigned to do this. Their de-vice laysdown thin stripsofhydrogel in acubiclattice structure (see picture) intend-ed to maximise the amountofsurface areafora given volume ofmaterial. The cube,which hassides1cm longin the currentde-sign, isthen cured bya burstofultravioletlight, to increase itsrigidity. Turning oneouttakesaboutﬁve minutes. The fun startswhen such a cube isplopped into a solution ofglucose. The hy-drogel ispermeable to thissolution, so theyeastisable to getto workon the glucose,convertingitinto ethanol asifitwere thesugarin the wortofa brewery. This, DrNelson had predicted. The sur-prise wasthatitkeepson doingso, dayafterday, weekafterweek, aslongas thefermented solution isregularlyreplacedwith fresh. The team’sbioreactorshavecontinued to produce ethanol in thiswayforoverfourmonthsnow, with no signs ofslowingdown. The cause ofthisdesirablephenomenon isnotyetclear. DrNelsonbelievesthatimmobilisingthe yeastcellsin the hydrogel somehowstopsthem bothageingand reproducing, withoutaﬀectingtheirabilityto ferment. Somehow, thecells’ conﬁnementissignallingto them tostop growingwithoutaﬀectingtheirnor-mal metabolism.Thatdiscoveryhasenormouspoten-tial. Ifitcould be industrialised, it wouldpave the wayforcontinuousfermentationto replace today’sbatch-processingap-proach, with all the advantagessuch con-tinuityofproduction would bring. To thisend, DrNelson nowplansto scale up thesize ofthe cubes. He also proposesto ex-perimentwith yeastcellsengineered toturn outmore complexmoleculesthanethanol—proteins, forexample—thatmighthave purposesotherthan gettingpeopledrunk. Thismayrequire tweakingthe hy-drogel, the currentstructure ofwhich islikelyto be too dense to permitthe passageofa large protein molecule. In the longerterm, itispossible to imag-ine a chain ofbioreactors, each specialisedfora single step in the syntheticpathwaythatleadsto a desirable productsuch asadrug. DrNelson’sﬁrsttask, though, will beto increase the concentration ofglucose inthe bioreactordesign thathe knows, with-outquestion, works, in the hope ofbrew-ingup somethingstrongerin hislaborato-ry. “Can we take ouryeast,” he wonders,“embed itin hydrogel, printitasa cube, putitin fruitjuice and convertitto alcohol?”Thatthought, ofa cheap, domestichoochplantwhich worksformonthson end, willhave brewersaround the world wanting topourthemselvesa stiﬀdrink.7Additive manufacturingPrintme abrewerySeattleAbetterwayto make drinks and drugsCubist artWHENitcomesto ﬁndinghidden ex-plosives, the self-propelled detectionsystem known asa sniﬀerdoghasnoequal.

Theirfossilsdate back atleast190m years(the oldestknown mam-malsdate from 230m yearsago). But, asZhangPengofSun Yat-sen University, inGuangzhou, China, and hiscolleaguesre-portin the Proceedingsofthe NationalAcademyofSciences, mostmodern frogsare beneﬁciariesofthe dinosaur-destroy-ingcollision in Yucatán. DrZhangand hiscolleagueshave builtan anuran cladogram—a familytree of156speciesoffrogforwhich reasonablygooddata have been deposited in GenBank, theworld’slargestrepositoryofDNAse-quences.

Averaged overtime,such changesactasticksofa molecularclock, givingsome idea ofwhen geneticlinesseparated. To calibrate thisclock, theresearchersalso looked at20 fossilsofknown age, which theyplaced atplausiblepointson the tree, based on the specimens’morphological characteristics.Theiranalysisshowed that88% ofexist-ingfrogspeciesbelongto one ofthreegroups—Hyloidea, Microhylidae and Nata-tanura—and thateach ofthese groupsun-derwenta sudden, rapid diversiﬁcationand expansion immediatelyafterthe Yu-catán impact. The researchersdid not,though, neglectthe remaining12% ofspe-cies. In the case ofthese, theywere able toshowhowthree earlierperiodsofdiversi-ﬁcation were related to the break-up ofthesupercontinent, called Pangaea, intowhich mostofEarth’sdryland wasunitedbetween 250m and 175m yearsago, afterwhich itbegan to divide. The ﬁrstofthese diversiﬁcations wascaused bya splitbetween the northernand southern partsofPangaea. The secondhappened when South America splitfromAfrica. The third occurred when India andthe Seychelles(which are geologically acontinent, albeita small one) separatedfrom one another.So, isthe post-dinosaurworld truly theAge ofFrogs?

So itisworth examin-inghisreasoning. America hasshaped asetofglobal rulesto suititself. Chinahasdiﬀerentvaluesand diﬀerentinterestswhich itwould like othersto accommo-date. Disagreementsare inevitable. Warwould be disastrousforboth sides,butthatdoesnotmean itcannothappen.No one wanted the ﬁrstworld war,yetitstarted anyway, thanksto a seriesof mis-calculations. The SovietUnion and Ameri-ca avoided all-outwar, buttheycameclose. Duringthe Cuban missile crisis in1962, when the Sovietstried to smuggle nu-clearmissilesonto Cuba, 90 miles(145km)from Florida, there were atleasta dozenclose callsthatcould have led to war.When American shipsdropped explosivesaround Sovietsubmarinesto force them tosurface, one Sovietcaptain thoughthe wasunderattackand nearlyﬁred hisnucleartorpedoes. When an American spyplaneﬂewinto Sovietairspace, Nikita Khru-shchev, the Sovietleader, worried thatAmerica wasscopingtargetsfora nuclearﬁrststrike. Had he decided to pre-empt it, athird world warcould have followed. China and America could blunderintowarin several ways, arguesMrAllison.Astand-oﬀoverTaiwan could escalate.North Korea’sdictator, Kim JongUn, mightdie withoutan obviousheir, sparking cha-os.

With Donald Trump in theWhite House, MrAllison worriesthatevenatrade warmightturn into a shooting war. He isrightthatMrTrump isfrightening-lyignorantofAmerica’schiefglobal rival,and thatboth sidesshould workharder tounderstand each other. ButMrAllison’soverall thesisistoo gloomy.

Yes, the Taiwan straitand the South China Sea are dangerous.Butunlike the greatpowersofold, Chinahasno desire to build a far-ﬂungempire.And all the warsin MrAllison’ssamplebroke outbefore the invention ofnuclearweapons.

Oratleastthat’swhatthe NewYork-Londonjet-setbelieves. Butin the north-west ofEngland, “pants” are trousers, justas theyare in America (and justastheywere ﬁrstelsewhere in England). “Pants” asunder-pantsisthe newcomer.JackGrieve, a linguistatBirminghamUniversity, usesTwitterto studyregionalpatternsin English. Those who thinkTwitterisonlygood forbeingrude aboutothersare dead wrong. Millionsofpeopleuse Twitterforordinarychitchatand un-ﬁltered thoughts. Thismaybe no greatcontribution to world literature, but itis agold mine fordialectologists.That’sbecause people on social net-workswrite much astheyspeak. Dialec-tologistsotherwise have a tough job. Toﬁnd dialectwordsorexpressions, theytrackdown old people in the countryside,sitwith them and patientlyquestionthem abouttheirchildhood, hopingtodrawoutdistinctive local wordsand ex-pressions. Butitistime-consuming, al-lowingdialectresearchersto interact withonlya small numberofspeakers. Theyare nagged bythe thoughtthatthey maynothave found trulyrepresentative ones,orthattheyare missingchangesafoot.Enterbigdata. People writingon Twit-terorFacebookleave an electronic datatrail thatcan be gathered and analysed almostinstantly. And in those media theyputwhattheywould sayin speech intotext, in a newmode ofcommunicationthatJohn McWhorterofColumbia Universityhascome to describe as“ﬁngered speech”. Fingered speech isperfectforthe dia-lectologistwho wantslotsofdata but isshortoftime. Ifpeople “talk” on Twitterastheydo in real life, all youneed is accesstolotsoftweets. Notall tweetsare public,and notall showthe location ofthe tweet-er, butthere are enough thattheyoﬀer billionsofbitsofusable data. MrGrieve can make postcode-by-post-code mapsshowingdialectfeatures. “Trou-sers” showsup asa starkwhite on hismapsin north-western England, meaningthe word ishardlyused there. In the south-east“Trousers” isdeep red. “Pants”, mean-ingtrousers, isa duskylightblue in Londonand the south-east, buta darkblue in northWalesand the north-west. (Oddly, peopledon’tseem to talkaboutunderwearmuchon Twitter.)The same goesforothershibboleths.“Sofa” isnear-universal in England, and“couch” dominantin Scotland. Smallerwordsare naturallyharderfordialectolo-gistsusingtraditional methodsto ﬁnd. Butwith Twitterdata, researcherscan easilyﬁnd the rarer“settee” enough timestoshowthatitispopularin south Wales andin bitsofthe north ofEngland. The resultsare culturallyinteresting,too. MrGrieve’smapsfor“gosh” in Amer-ica showthis“minced oath” to be popularnotonlyin Mormon Utah, butin a contig-uousregion ofthe inland south, from Texasto Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri,Tennessee and Kentucky. Butcontrary towhatone mightexpect, ithardlyshowsup in the deep-Dixie statesofMississippi,Alabama and Georgia. Thingsgeteven more interestingwhenMrGrieve stackshismaps—some 9,000ofthem—on top ofeach otherto ﬁnd big-gerpatterns. And here the mysteryof“gosh” issolved: the inland south is heavi-lywhite and religious. Manyblacks stilllive in the lowland south, where their ancestorsworked asslaves. And blackAmericans, on the whole, speak(andtweet) diﬀerentlyfrom white ones, a factthatshowsup brightlyin MrGrieve’swork: the south-eastiseasilythe most dis-tinctregion on hismap. In otherwords,these are notjustdialectregions, butcul-tural regions. The second mostdistinctivediﬀerence in hismapscomesfrom the ru-ral-urban divide. The coastsand big citiesuse “bagel” and “avocado”; in rural andinland bits“truck” and “boots” abound.That’sa lotofworkto conﬁrm stereo-types, butithasthe advantage ofcaptur-ingquicklywhatpollstersand cultural geographerscould onlyspeculate overwith censusdata. Billionsofdata pointsalso make the workrobust. And last, Twit-tercan capture changesthatwould taketraditional researchers—whethergeogra-phersordialectologists—so much timethattheymightmissquick-movingdevel-opments.
