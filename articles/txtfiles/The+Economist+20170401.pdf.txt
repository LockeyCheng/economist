Enoughvotersdecided thatboasting, mocking, lyingand grabbingwomen were secondary. Some Trump fanseven sawthem asthe credentialsofan authentic, swamp-drainingsaviour.After70 daysin oﬃce, however, MrTrump isstuckin thesand. Ahealth-care bill promised asone ofhis“ﬁrstacts” suf-fered a humiliatingcollapse in the—Republican-controlled—Congress(see Lexington). Hisrepeated attemptsto draft curbson travel to America from some Muslim countriesare beingblocked bythe courts. And suspicionsthathiscampaign col-laborated with Russia have costhim hisnational security ad-viserand looklikelyto doghisadministration (see page 31).Votersare notimpressed. No otherpresidentso early in hisﬁrstterm hassuﬀered such lowapproval ratings.Itistemptingto feel reliefthatthe Trump presidency isamess. Forthose who doubtmuch ofhisagenda and worryabouthislackofrespectforinstitutions, perhapsthe besthopeisthathe accomplisheslittle. Thatlogicisbeguiling, butwrong.Afteryearsofgridlock, Washington hasworkto do. The forth-comingsummitwith Xi Jinping, China’spresident, showshowAmerica isstill the indispensable nation. Aweakpresident canbe dangerous—picture a trade war, a crisisin the Baltics orcon-ﬂicton the Korean peninsula.The business ofgovernmentMrTrump ishardlythe ﬁrsttycoon to discoverthatbusinessand politicsworkbydiﬀerentrules. Ifyoufall out overa prop-ertydeal, youcan alwaysﬁnd anothersucker. In politics youcannotwalkawayso easily. Even ifMrTrump nowdespisesthe Republican factionsthatdared defyhim overhealth care,Congressisthe onlyplace he can go to passlegislation. The nature ofpolitical powerisdiﬀerent, too. As ownerandCEOofhisbusiness, MrTrump had absolute control. The con-stitution setsoutto blockwould-be autocrats. Where MrTrump hasacted appropriately—aswith hisnomination of aprincipled, conservative juristto ﬁll a Supreme Court vacan-cy—he deservesto prevail. Butwhen the courtsquestion the le-galityofhistravel ordertheyare onlydoingtheirjob. Likewise,the Republican failure to mustera majorityoverhealth-care re-ﬂectsnotjustdivisionsbetween the party’smoderatesandhardliners, butalso the defectsofa bill that, bythe end, wouldhave led to worse protection, ornone, fortensofmillions ofAmericanswithoutsavingtaxpayersmuch money. Farfrom takingWashington bystorm, America’sCEOisoutofhisdepth. The artofpolitical compromise isnewto him. Heblurshisown interestsand the interestsofthe nation. Thescrutinyofoﬃce grates. He chafesunderthe limitations ofbe-ingthe mostpowerful man in the world. Youhave only to fol-lowhisincontinentstream oftweetsto grasp MrTrump’spara-noia and vanity: the pressliesabouthim; the election resultfraudulentlyomitted millionsofvotesforhim; the intelligenceservicesare disloyal; hispredecessortapped hisphones. It’sneitherprettynorpresidential.Thatthe main victim ofthese slurshasso farbeen thetweeter-in-chiefhimselfistestamentto the strength ofAmeri-can democracy. Butinstitutionscan erode, and the country iswretchedlydivided (see page 19). UnlessMrTrump changescourse, the harm risksspreading. The nexttestwill be the bud-get. Ifthe Republican Partycannotpassa stop-gap measure,the governmentwill startto shutdown on April 29th. Recentjittersin the marketsare a sign thatinvestorsare counting onMrTrump and hispartyto passlegislation.More than anything, theyare lookingfortaxreform and aninfrastructure plan. There isvastscope to make ﬁscal policymore eﬃcientand fairer(see page 29). American ﬁrmsfacehigh taxratesand have a disincentive to repatriate proﬁts. Per-sonal taxesare a labyrinth ofprivilegesand loopholes, mostofwhich beneﬁtthe well-oﬀ. Likewise, the country’scrampedairportsand potholed highwaysare a drain on productivity.Sure enough, MrTrump hasletitbe known thathe now wantsto tackle tax. And, in a bid to win supportfrom Democrats, hemaydeal with infrastructure atthe same time. Yetthe politicsoftaxreform are astreacherousas the poli-ticsofhealth care, and notonlybecause theywill generate fe-rociouslobbying. MostRepublican plansare shockingly re-gressive, despite MrTrump’sblue-collarbase. To win even amodestreform, MrTrump and histeam will have to show amasteryofdetail and coalition-buildingthathasso far eludedthem. IfMrTrump’spopularityfallsfurther, the job of win-ningoverfractiousRepublicanswill onlybecome harder.Were he frustrated in Congress, the presidentwould surelyfall backon areaswhere he hasa free hand. He hasalreadymade full-throated use ofexecutive ordersand promises toharnessthe bureaucracyto force through hisagenda. In theoryhe could deregulate partsofthe economy, such asﬁnance,where the hand ofgovernmentissometimestoo heavy. Yet hisexecutive ordersso farhave been crudelytheatrical—as withthisweek’srepeal ofBarackObama’senvironmental rules,which will notlead to the renaissance ofminingjobs thathehasdisingenuouslypromised coal country(see leader). Itisthesame with trade. MrTrump could workthrough the WorldTrade Organisation to open markets. More probably, the eco-nomicnationalistson histeam will have the upperhand. Ifso,America will take a bilateral approach, trade protection willgrowand foreign policywill become more confrontational.The characterquestionThe Americanswho voted forMrTrump eitheroverlooked hisbombast, ortheysawin him a tycoon with the self-belief totransform Washington. Although thispresidencyisstillyoung, thatalreadyseemsan errorofjudgment. Hispolicies,from health-care reform to immigration, have been poor—theydo noteven passthe narrowtestthattheybeneﬁtTrump vot-ers. MostworryingforAmerica and the world ishowfast thebusinessman in the Oval Oﬃce isprovingunﬁtforthe job. 7FrustrationThe Trump presidencyis in a hole. Thatis bad forAmerica—and the worldLeaders12LeadersThe EconomistApril1st2017NINE tumultuousmonthsafterBritonsvoted to leavethe European Union, the realBrexitprocessisatlastunderway. Theresa May’sdispatch ofaletterto the European Councilon March 29th, invokingArticle50 ofthe EU treaty, marked thepointatwhich Britain’swithdrawal from the union became allbutinevitable. Forhalfthe country’spopulation thiswasa mo-mentto celebrate; forthe otherhalf, includingthis newspaper,itmarked a bleakday. The future ofboth camps—and of the EUitself—nowdependson whatMrsMaydoesnext.The negotiationsare sure to be diﬃcult(see page 45). Time isshort, since Article 50 comeswith a two-yeardeadline. ThetaskofunwindingBritain’smembership ofthe club isfear-somelycomplex. Neitherside iswell prepared. In Britain,where Brexitincreasinglyresemblesa faith-based initiative,votershave been given wildlyunrealisticexpectations oftheUtopia ahead. Theirﬁrstcontactwith the realityof losingpref-erential accessto theirmain marketwill be traumatic. UnlessMrsMaycan persuade the Brexiteerson herown side that theymustacceptconcessions, Britain mayend up ﬂouncing outofEurope withoutanydeal atall.Cruising fora bruisingThe timetable istightereven than itlooks. The sides mayspendweeksarguingoverprocess. The EUwantsto ﬁxthe termsofthe Article 50 divorce, coveringsuch mattersasthe rights ofcitizensresidentin othercountriesand Britain’smulti-billion-euro exitbill, before startingworkon a future trade deal; MrsMaywantsto negotiate on everythingatonce. Nothing muchwill be agreed on before the German election in September. Atthe end ofitall, ratifyingthe deal will take sixmonths. Thatleaveslittle more than a yearforthe talksthemselves.MrsMay’spriorityisto fulﬁl the Leave campaign’spromiseto “take backcontrol” byendingthe free movementofEUcit-izensto Britain and the jurisdiction ofthe European CourtofJustice (ECJ). She hasacknowledged thatthismeansleavingthe EU’ssingle market. Butleavingwould be a mistake. Even ifittakescontrol ofimmigration, Britain will notbe able to cutthe numbersmuch withoutdamagingthe economy, asminis-tersare slowlyrealising. And the governmentiswrong to claimthatthere existssome relationship with the single market thathasall the beneﬁtsofmembership with none ofthe costs.Itistrue thatmanyBritonsbacked Brexitbecause theywanted to cutimmigration and regain sovereignty, but theydid notvote to make themselvespoorer—asMrsMay’s“hardBrexit” will. Hergovernmenthasbeen characterised byU-turnsand herletterthisweekwasmore emollientthan someofherearlierstatements. Even so, in thrall to Brexiteering back-benchersand the Euroscepticpress, she isunlikelyto changecourse now.MrsMayisnotjustmakingthe wrongchoices, butalsodownplayingawkward trade-oﬀs. Bypromisingbarrier-freeaccessto the single marketwhile stoppingEUmigrantsandendingthe ECJ’sjurisdiction, she isstill tellingBritons theycanhave theircake and eatit. Although she concedesthat export-ersto the EUwill have to obeyEUrules, the more MrsMayin-sistson controllingEUmigration and escapingthe ECJ, the lessbarrier-free will be Britain’soverall accessto the single market.Thisisnotjustbecause free movementofpeople isa conditionforthe EU, norbecause itwill be hard to secure tariﬀ-free accessfortrade in goods, somethingboth sidescan readilyagree on. Itisbecause the biggestobstaclessweptawaybythe single mar-ketare nottariﬀsorcustomschecks, butnon-tariﬀ barrierssuch asstandards, regulationsand state-aid rules. Unless Brit-ain acceptsthese, which impliesa role forthe system’sreferee,the ECJ, itcannotoperate freelyin the single market—as evenAmerican ﬁrmstradingin the EUhave found.Boxed into a cornerThe mostdangerousofMrsMay’sillusionshasbeen herclaimthatno deal isbetterthan a bad deal. Herletterthis weekstepsbackfrom thisnotion, butonlya pace. To revertto trading withthe EUonlyon World Trade Organisation (WTO) termswouldcause seriousharm to Britain’seconomy. Itwould mean the EUimposingtariﬀsplusa full panoplyofnon-tariﬀbarriers on al-mosthalfBritain’sexports. No bigcountrytradeswith the EUonlyon WTO terms. An acrimoniousbreak-up would make itharderto co-operate in such areasasforeign policyand de-fence. And itwould surelyincrease the riskofBrexit triggeringScotland’sexitfrom the United Kingdom.MrsMayneedsnotmerelyto soften hertone, asshe hasstarted to do thisweek, butto lowerexpectations. Instead ofthreateningto undercutherEuropean partnersbybuilding anunregulated Singapore-on-Thames(somethingthat, despite itsappeal to free-traders, would horrifymostBrexitvoters), orhintingthatBritain mightco-operate lessfullyon security, orclaimingthatthe EUneedsBritain more than the otherwayround, she should acceptthatin these negotiationsshe holdsthe weakerhand. She should hence be more ﬂexible over pay-mentsinto the EUbudget, a subjectherletterskatesover.Because negotiatinga full free-trade deal iscertain to takemore than two years—no countryhasconcluded one with theEU in so shorta time—she should acceptanotherconsequence:thattransitional arrangementswill be needed to avoid “fallingoﬀa cliﬀ” in March 2019. Herlettertalksairilyof“implementa-tion periods”, butdoesnotacknowledge howhard these maybe to sortout. Aproper, time-limited transition might meanprolongingfree movementofpeople and the rule ofthe ECJ,butthatprice would be worth payingfora betterBrexit.The softertone ofMrsMay’slettermight, with luck, encour-age herEUpartnersto be more accommodating. So fartheyhave reacted to threatsfrom London in kind, talkingup the exitbill, insistingthatBritain endsup beingworse oﬀoutside theclub than inside and diggingin overtermsforco-operating inforeign and securitypolicies. There isa possibility ofa deal be-tween Britain and the EUthatminimisesBrexit’sharm. Unfor-tunately, in a negotiation againstthe clockwhere both sidesstartso farapart, there isalso a bigriskofone that maximisesharm instead. 7Britain and the European UnionThe negotiatorAs Brexitbegins, Britain is due fora brutal encounterwith reality. Time to be honestaboutthe trade-oﬀs aheadThe EconomistApril1st2017 Leaders131COALMINERScheered thisweekwhen Donald Trumpissued an executive orderto startunwindingBarackObama’sﬂagship climate policies; thenewmeasuresinclude ending amoratorium on the leasingoffederal land formining. “Myad-ministration isputtingan end to the waron coal,” declared MrTrump. Yetthe blackstuﬀisstill in a heap oftrouble. In Ameri-ca cheap natural gashassurpassed coal asa source of powergeneration; no White House ceremonycan do much aboutthat. And forall the attention on America, much the more im-portantchapterin the tale ofcoal’sdecline isbeingwritten onthe otherside ofthe world. India isthe third-largestcarbon emitter, afterChina andAmerica. No fuel mattersmore to itthan coal: itﬁres up 61% ofIndia’spower-generatingcapacityand Coal India istheworld’sbiggestcoal company. Since coal generatesmore car-bon emissionswhen itisburned than otherfossil fuels—to saynothingofitseﬀecton airquality—India isa crucial protagonistin the battle againstclimate change (see page 61). Ithasalso longbeen seen asa wild card. On the one hand,the country’sgrowth projectionsand justiﬁable desire to sup-plypowerto about240m Indianswho lackitimplythatitsgreenhouse-gasemissionslookasiftheywill almostdouble.On the other, itsplansforsolarand wind energyare so ambi-tiousthatmanyhave found them hard to believe. Buttwothingssuggestthatthe outlookforcoal in India isdarkening. First, the governmenthasdeclared thatitneedsno morecoal-ﬁred powerstationsduringthe nextdecade than thosebeingbuilttoday. About40% ofIndia’scoal-ﬁred plantcapaci-tyislyingidle, because the authoritieshave overestimated thegrowth in demand forelectricity, and because ofthe ﬁnancialweaknessofelectricity-distribution ﬁrms.

Seated in hisunfussy25th-ﬂooroﬃce in lowerManhattan, MrSchneiderman told them to assume MrTrump’sbrutish campaign pledgeswere inearnest, and to cleartheirdesksfor action.While the president-electwasdigestinghisvictoryin Trump Tower, ﬁve miles upthe road, MrSchneiderman putscoresofthe 650 lawyersathisdisposal on Trumpwatch. Theystarted trawlingthrough hiscampaign statementsand preparinglegaldefencesagainstthe assaultshe had prom-ised on immigration, consumerprotectionand climate-change policy. With the Re-publicanswho control Congressapparent-lyunwillingto hold MrTrump to account,MrSchneiderman feared thatDemocraticattorneys-general mighthave to actas athin blue line ofresistance to an authoritar-ian president. MrSchneiderman, a small man whospeaksfastand wastesfewwords, alreadyunderstood MrTrump’scapacityforrule-breaking. In 2013 he sued MrTrump overthe ﬂeecingofstudentsatTrump Universi-ty, a bogustrainingscheme forwould-bepropertymoguls. In response, the tycoonalleged maliciousprosecution and suedhim formillionsofdollars. In 2014 the NewYorkObserver, a newspaperowned byMrTrump’sson-in-lawand adviser, JaredKushner, ran a lengthyhatchetjob on him.“I did notrealise itatthe time,” he says,“butI wasgettinga previewofthe scorch-ed earth approach he takesto opposition.”Ten weeksinto histerm, MrTrump isbehavingmuch asMrSchneiderman pre-dicted. Amongotheraﬀronts, he hastriedto discreditthe electoral processby makingfalse claimsaboutillegal votingand haspeddled false allegationsthatBritain spiedon him. He hasfailed to disengage convinc-inglyfrom hisbusinessinterests, or revealthe extentofthem. He hassigned cruel andamateurish immigration rulesand, whentheyfaced legal challenge, argued thathisborderpolicywasno businessofthecourts. Accordingto the fact-checkers attheWashington Post, MrTrump uttered 317“false ormisleading” statementsin hisﬁrst63 daysaspresident. “It’sbeen clearsincehe tookoﬃce”, saysMrSchneiderman,who joined the attackon the immigrationrules, “thatthispresidenthaslessregardforthe rule oflawand precedentand tradi-tionsthan anyone in recentmemory.” Yetalthough MrSchneiderman’sesti-mation ofthe threatMrTrump posesap-pearswell judged, hissense ofAmerica’svulnerabilitynowlookspessimistic.Thefailure ofthe Republicansin the House ofRepresentativeson March 24th to passahealth-care bill on which MrTrump hadstaked hisimage asAmerica’scloser-in-chiefshowsthatthe presidentcannot car-ryall before him. Avigorousrepulse to hisexcessesfrom journalists, NGOs, compa-niesand millionsofprotesters, aswell asthe states, hasproved additionallyincon-venient. America’sconstitutional checksand balancesappearto be holdingup bet-terthan manyfeared.The defeatofthe American Health CareAct(AHCA), itmustbe admitted, was hard-lya textbookillustration ofJamesMadi-son’sconstitutional ideal thatpresidentialambition be frustrated bythe powersofCongress. The bill’saspiration, to begin theprocessofrepealingBarackObama’shealth-care reform, known asObamacare,iswidelyshared amongRepublicans. Un-derMrObama, House Republicansfutilelyvoted to repeal Obamacare more than 50times. Gettingrid ofitwasone ofMrTrump’smain campaign pledges. The 30-odd right-wingers, known asthe HouseFreedom Caucus, who opposed the repealbill, causingPaul Ryan, the RepublicanSpeakerofthe House, to withdrawit, in-tended no rebuke to MrTrump. Manycau-cusmembersadmire him. TheirtargetwasMrRyan, whose pragmatism theyabhor:theyfelthisbill, which theyderided as“Obamacare-lite”, would notsuﬃcientlyreduce federal subsidieswhich help thepoorbuyhealth insurance.Regardlessoftheirtarget, theydealtablowto MrTrump.

Perhaps hewill recoversome ofhislostface, as BillClinton did aftersuﬀeringhisown health-care reform foul-up earlyin hispresidency.ButMrTrump will have to acquire betternegotiatingskills. He could also do withliftinghisapproval ratings; according topollingbyGallup, only35% ofAmericansthinkhe isdoinga good job, which is un-likelyto strike fearinto MrMeadows.The debacle hasforced MrTrump toconsiderwooingDemocraticcongressmen(there istalkofhim linkinghistax reformplans, ofwhich Democratsare sceptical, tohisinfrastructure plans, which theylike),which would require him to moderate hisbehaviour. Some Republican senators,who have longertermsand more mixedelectoratesthan theircolleaguesin theHouse, are alreadydemandinghe do so.Though the AHCAdefeatdid notin itselfaugurbettercongressional oversightof MrTrump, the spectre thathaunted MrSchneiderman—a uniﬁed Republican gov-ernmentuncriticallysupportinga roguepresident—islookinglessthreatening.Lawsuits, satire and social mediaThe courtshave provided a more straight-forward check. MrTrump’simmigrationrulesappeared to be an attemptto honourhiscampaign promise to keep outMus-lims; theywere disguised ascounter-terro-rism measuresagainsthigh-risknational-itiesin an eﬀortto evade the constitutionalbaron discriminatingon the basisof reli-gion. Both edictswere challenged bybroadcoalitionsofstates, NGOsand private ﬁrmsand subsequentlystayed byjudgeson pro-cedural and constitutional grounds. Thepresidentimpugned the legitimacyoftheﬁrstobstructive beak, JamesRobart—aGeorge W. Bush appointee whom MrTrump described asa “so-called judge”.Even hisown nominee to the SupremeCourt, Neil Gorsuch, a Coloradan jurist,thoughtthistoo much. “When anyone crit-icisesthe honesty, the integrityorthe mo-tivesofa federal judge, I ﬁnd that disheart-ening,” he said duringhisSenateconﬁrmation hearingon March 21st.The media, leakybureaucratsand themillionswho have ﬂocked to ralliesagainsthispresidency(which, thoughdwindling, are still widespread) have pro-vided such a barrage ofextra-constitution-al scrutinythatsome thinka newsystemofaccountabilityisemerging. “We’re see-inga vastlyexpanded deﬁnition ofchecksand balances, and theyseem to be work-ing,” saysAlan Dershowitz, a legal scholar.In a world worried aboutthe rise offake news, the bestcoverage ofMrTrump’sadministration hasbeen tremendous. TheNewYorkTimesand Washington Posthavehad weeklyscoopsaboutthe peculiarchumminessbetween itsseniormembersand variousRussians; the scandal has sofarforced Michael Flynn to quitasnationalsecurityadviserand JeﬀSessions, the at-torney-general, to recuse himselffrom hisdepartment’sinvestigation into allega-tionsthatMrTrump’steam colluded withRussian hackersduringthe campaign.Those revelationshave also made itharderforRepublican congressmen to ignore theissue, assome, includingDevin Nunes,who headsthe House intelligence commit-tee, would clearlyprefer(see page 31).Honed bydecadesofgrowingpartisan-ship and lowexpectationsofcongressio-nal oversight, the response to MrTrumpfrom NGOs, left-leaningand otherwise,hasbeen similarlyimpressive. The Ameri-can Civil LibertiesUnion, which sued theadministration overboth setsofimmigra-tion rules, received over$24m in online do-nationsoverthe course ofa recentweek-end, more than sixtimeswhatitnormallyexpectsto collectonline in a year. Forsome, thisisa continuation ofpreviousstruggles; to briefreporterson itsplans toresistMrTrump one environmental groupdustsoﬀa historyofits(broadlysuccess-ful) legal stand-oﬀswith MrBush.MrDershowitzalso pointsto less or-ganised checks, includingcritical commen-taryon social media, disapprovingforeignalliesand mercilesslate-nightcomics: MrTrump hasperked up American satire andthe careerofAlecBaldwin (pictured). “It’samore transient, notpredictable orreliable,notvisible ortransparentsystem, whichhasitsown dangers,” he says. “Butin myviewitwill be strongenough to be a suﬃ-cientcheckon thispresidency.” Itisa sad reﬂection ofthe state ofAmer-ica thata quasi-constitutional role for “Sat-urdayNightLive” could seem reassuring.The system thatthe founderscreated as awayforthe diﬀerentbranchesofgovern-mentto countereach other’sexcessesshould notneed shoringup bya posse ofbloggersand disloyal civil servants. Theconstitutional frailtythisreveals, and ofwhich MrTrump’selection isto some de-gree symptomatic, hasin factbeen evidentforsome time.Itisoverfourdecadessince the histori-an ArthurSchlesingerwarned, in “The Im-perial Presidency”, ofa post-warpowergrab bythe executive branch “so spaciousand peremptoryasto implya radical trans-formation ofthe traditional polity.” Thebookwasa hit, butdid nothingto interruptasteadyﬂowofpowersto the WhiteHouse which hascontinued underall thepresidentssince. Asthe executive openedup newdomainsforitselfin settingpollu-tion standardsforindustry, overseeingbankingand even orderingthe country towar, a clearcongressional prerogative, thepresidential bureaucracyballooned. Asitgrew, itbecame increasingly politi-cised; underJohn F. Kennedy, 196 presiden-tial appointmentsrequired Senate conﬁr-mation, now1,212 do. And itbecame morecentralised. In the 1930sCongressmag-nanimouslypermitted Franklin D. Roose-veltto maintain a staﬀofsix“presidentialassistants”; recentpresidentshave com-manded an armyofover500 White Housestaﬀers, whose mission isto ensure thegovernmentbendsto the president’swill,and thathe getsall the creditwhen it does.Thishastransformed the characterof gov-ernment, from a semblance ofwell-ad-vised policymakingto a relentlesseﬀort tofulﬁl presidential campaign promises.Aspace forauthoritarianismAtthe expense ofCongress, recentpresi-dentshave also assumed additional pow-ersoverforeign policyand civil liberties. Indoingso theyriskbeingchecked byjudges.Buttheyhave mitigated thatpossibility byassembling, in the oﬃce ofthe WhiteHouse counsel, a batteryofingenious, Su-preme Court-qualitylawyers; MrObamaemployed almost50. The resulthasbeen aproliferation ofcontentiouslegal prece-dents, extendingthe authorityofthe presi-dent, which in unscrupuloushandscouldamountto a toolkitfortyranny. FollowingMrBush’sand MrObama’sexample, thepresidentcan orderAmerican citizens tobe killed secretlyoverseas, detain foreignprisonersindeﬁnitelywithoutcharge andtrythem on the basisofevidence that thestate will notdivulge.Despite spasmsofconcern, both liber-alsand conservativeshave applauded thisexecutive powergrab. “I wantto strength-en the currentDemocraticpresident,” saidNewtGingrich, when he wasa bitterly par-tisan Republican Speakerofthe House un-derMrClinton, “because he isthe presi-Not quite what Madison had in mindThe Economist April1st2017BrieﬁngAmerica’schecksandbalances212dent.” Scholarsofboth stripeshave oftenargued thatthe risksofoverreach were jus-tiﬁed bythe president’sdemocraticprerog-ative to fulﬁl hismandate. The growingdysfunction in Congress, which hasseenitslawmakingand oversightgive waytoshoutytribalism (forwhich MrGingrichdeservesmuch blame) hasmeanwhilemade thatconclusion seem more natural.ForifCongresswill notpasslaws, how elseisthe countryto be governed?These constitutional evilsreinforceeach other. Congress, a bodythe FoundingFathersconsidered so dangerousthatitneeded splittingin two, isin itsdemoral-ised state especiallysusceptible to un-thinkingpartyallegiance. Thishasin turnworn awaymanyofthe democraticnormsupon which the checksand balancesde-pend. DespairingofSenate Republicans’use ofthe ﬁlibusterto blockMrObama’sappointees, forexample, the Democratsscrapped the measure in 2013, exceptin thecase ofSupreme Courtappointments.Nowthe Democratsare in the minority,vowingto blockMrGorsuch, and the Re-publicansare likelyto remove thatlast de-fence ofscrutinybythe minorityparty infederal appointments. Atthe same time, a combination ofvengeful partisanship, internet-based al-ternative realitiesand the primarysystemofnominatingcandidates, which pro-moteshardliners, istiltingAmerican poli-ticstowardsextremism. Putthistogetherwith the growth ofexecutive powerandthe frayingofconstitutional checkson itand the risksofsomethinggoingseriouslywrongin the White House are obvious. In2010 Bruce Ackerman, a Yale legal scholar,predicted itwasonlya matteroftime be-fore America elected a “charismaticpresi-dentto politicise the bureaucracyand runroughshod overthe rule oflaw”. In thiswidercontext, the constraints onMrTrump looklessreassuring. Hispresi-dencybecomesa predicted step in a pro-cessofdemocraticdecline which hisun-scrupulousleadership islikelytoaccelerate. To arrestthatdecline wouldtake substantial reform, with newcheckson the executive, a reinvigorated Congressand political partiesfreed from the thrall ofhardliners—all unimaginable today. So itisappropriate to ponderhowmuch damageMrTrump could do, even ifhe remainsconstrained bythe forcesMrDershowitzand othersﬁnd comforting.Mostofhisrecentfrustrationshavebeen self-inﬂicted, which isin a way reas-suring. Though MrTrump issometimescompared to the White House’slastbigrule breaker, Richard Nixon, he appearsmuch lesscompetent. Nixon wasa skilful,hardworkingcriminal; MrTrump isablowhard who even nowseemsunawareofthe magnitude and complexityofthe of-ﬁce he holds. Still, he and hisadvisers willgetbetteratusingthe presidential toolkit,includingitslegal precedentsand ﬁrepow-er. In the eventofa threatto national secu-rity, forexample, MrTrump’sappetite forpowerand desire to be vindicated over hisIslamophobicrhetoriccould produce direresults. Oh, forthe days ofthe snuﬀboxThe Trump team alreadyhasplansto bringthe presidential bureaucracyto heel. “Theadministrative state isn’tgoingto adminis-teritself,” saysa seniorWhite House oﬃ-cial. One plan, he suggests, isto send “tigerteamsinto the beast, to ask, ‘Howhave youimplemented the wishesand policiesofthe president?’” Leakers, beware.Howsuccessful such tacticsare may de-pend largelyon MrTrump’spolitical for-tunes—which could be much betterthanmanyofhisopponentsassume. Even if hisratingsremain low, the realitiesofa polar-ised electorate and a favourable electoralmapmean thatthe Republicansmaywellretain both congressional housesin nextyear’smid-term elections. MrTrump willalso have the chance to nominate over a100 federal judges, perhapsincluding a sec-ond Supreme Courtjustice. Both develop-mentscould strengthen him considerably.Ifan FBIinvestigation into the Russia con-nection turned up somethingserious, a Re-publican congresswould still be loth to im-peach MrTrump.MrTrump’scontribution to the decayofdemocraticnormsalreadyappearsvast.Each time he badmouthsan institution ormakesfalse claimsabouta predecessor,opponentorpeer, America’sdemocraticframeworktakesa hit. Some ofthe damagemaybe permanent. Ashowofdecencyonce mattered in American politics; then63m Americansvoted to electaspresidentaman theyhad heard boastingofhisabili-tyto assaultwomen. Itwasalso recentlyaccepted thata sittingpresidentmust pub-lish histaxreturnsand disengage from hisbusinessinterests. MrTrump, who hasdone neither, doesnotappearto have anyproblem with the proﬁtsﬂowingfrom hispresidency.Asthe Washington Posthasreported, hehasspentalmosta third ofhistime as presi-dentata Trump-branded property, includ-inghisMar-a-Lago estate in Florida, whereclub membershave been treated to thesightofthe presidenturgentlydiscussingNorth Korean missile launchesoversalad.Because anotherofhispresidentialhaunts, the Trump International hotel, ashortwalkalongPennsylvania Avenuefrom the White House, isalso popular withforeign dignitaries, MrTrump hasbeensued overan obscure clause ofthe consti-tution thatforbidspublicservantsfrom ac-ceptingfeesorgiftsfrom a foreign state.Some legal scholarshave, rathervaliantly,cited asprecedentBenjamin Franklin’sseekingCongress’sapproval before accept-inga jewel-encrusted snuﬀboxfrom thekingofFrance asa retirementgift. The dis-tance and obscurityofthe precedentillus-tratesthe main diﬃcultyofusingthe lawtorestrain the president’sbehaviour. No onehaseverseen anythinglike it.PerhapsMrTrump will be adequatelyconstrained nonetheless. The reassuringlytrenchantresponsesto hisexcessesfromthe judiciary, states, bureaucracyandNGOssuggesta democracymore vitalthan some fear. Itmighteven one day seemridiculousthata ﬁgure asunserious asMrTrump could have seemed so threatening.Buteven in thatbestcase, itwill take some-thingmore to restore America’sdemocrat-icsystem to a more foolproofstate.

The signalsare ampliﬁed bysimilaronesfurtherdown the system andﬂeshed outbycontrolled discussions instate-owned media. In the realm offoreignpolicy, all thatishappeningnow. Soon afterMrXi’scommentsin Davosand Beijing, the prime minister, Li Keqiang,gave hisannual “workreport”—a sortofstate-of-the-nation speech.

Andtheyhave begun to discussthe makings ofan idea that, unlike the old one ofa Chinamodel, the countrywould like to sell toothers. Thisisthe so-called “China sol-ution”. The phrase wasﬁrstmentioned lastWhetherthisstoryistrue ornot, thespeech wasstrikinglyinternational in toneand subjectmatter.AdaylaterMrXi made itclearwhom hehad in hissights. Atthe UNin Geneva, hetalked abouta “hegemon imposingitswillon others” and warned America abouta“Thucydidestrap”—the disasterthatbefellancientGreece when the incumbentpow-er, Sparta, failed to accommodate the risingone, Athens. In FebruaryMrXi told a con-ference on securityin BeijingthatChinashould “guide international society” to-wardsa “more justand rational newworldorder”. PreviouslyMrXi had venturedonlythatChina should playa role in build-ingsuch a world. Yourconsensus is nonsenseThere wasa time when America wasurg-ingChina to step up itsglobal game.

Unlike the Chinamodel, which itsboosterssaid wasaimedatdevelopingcountries, the China sol-ution, saysDavid KellyofChina Policy, aconsultancy, isforeveryone—includingWestern countries. Thismarksa change. Chinese leadersneverpraised the China model; itsfanswere mainlyChinese academicsand thecountry’scheerleadersin the West. (Longbefore the term became fashionable, Dengadvised the presidentofGhana: “Do notfollowthe China model.”) Mostoﬃcialswere waryofitbecause the term could beinterpreted asChina layingdown the lawto others, contradictingitspolicyof notin-terferingin othercountries’ internal aﬀairs.In contrast, itwasMrXi himselfwhobroached the idea ofthe China solution.Hisprime ministerincluded itin his workreport.

China’svastbureaucracyisresistantto change in foreign policy, asineverythingelse. Duringa recenttrip to Aus-tralia the foreign minister, WangYi, saidChina had “no intention ofleadingany-body”. He wasnotcontradictingMrXi, butneitherwashe echoingthe president’sde-sire to guide a newworld order. Ding Yi-fangofthe Institute ofWorld Develop-ment, a think-tankin Beijing, issimilarlycautiousaboutthe China solution. “Wedon’thave universal ideals,” he says. “Weare notthatambitious.” Globalism with Chinese characteristicsSo whatmightChina’sunassumingnewassertivenessmean in practice? Atemplatecan be found in climate-change policy. Chi-na wasone ofthe main obstaclesto a glo-bal climate agreementin 2008, butnowitswordsare the lingua franca ofclimate-re-lated diplomacy. Partsofa deal on carbonemissionsbetween MrXi and BarackObama were incorporated wholesale intothe Parisclimate treatyof2016. Chinahelped determine howthataccord deﬁneswhatare known as“common and diﬀeren-tiated responsibilities”, namelyhowmucheach countryshould be responsible forcuttingemissions.

The ru-mouristhatPresidentXi Jinpinghimselfwill attend. What wasstrikingaboutthe handoverceremonyon July1st1997 wasthatHongKong’speople were notrepresented. Theywere mere by-standers—orelse helpingwith the catering. From the start, HongKongerswere symbolicallyputin theirplace.

Yetoutofa population of7.3m, the onlyoneswith a votewere the fewerthan 1,200 membersofa committee stacked withsupportersofthe CommunistPartyin Beijing.When the vote’soutcome became clear(again in the conven-tion centre), MrsLam’smiddle-aged supportersin the public gal-lerycheered and unfurled Chinese ﬂags. Theylooked suspicious-lylike the delighted crowdsthatappearin mainland China whenbigwigsmeetthe public. MrsLam isa capable administrator whowasformerlythe head ofthe civil service, butshe lacks the com-mon touch. Herimage isofsomeone keen to please the mastersin Beijing. Opinion pollssuggested thateven amongthe threecarefullyvetted candidatesallowed to run, she wasfar lesspop-ularthan the formerﬁnance secretary, John Tsang. He is more per-sonable and wantsthe territoryto have more democracythan ithasbeen allowed. And so a question hangsoverMrsLam: howwill she command the supportofthe public?The question hasdogged all three chiefexecutivesto date, butnone more so than the outgoingone, “C.Y.” LeungChun-ying.Cool and aloof, he hasneverbeen able to shake oﬀsuspicionsthathe isa secretmemberofthe CommunistParty. Some ofhispolicymeasures, such asstepstaken to improve the lot ofthe el-derly, are under-appreciated. Buthismain mission hasbeen polit-ical: to keep in checkmuch ofwhatmakesHongKongdistinct.In particular, he faced down the huge “Occupy” or“Umbrella”protestsin 2014 thatgrewin response to ruleshanded down byChina’slegislature forhowthe chiefexecutive’selection, justpast, should be organised. The BasicLaw, the mini-constitutiondrafted forHongKongbefore the handover, promised universalsuﬀrage by2017. The newrulesenvisaged that, too. Butthey alsoinsisted on a processforvettingcandidatesthatwasclearly in-tended to keep democratictypesoutofthe running. Hong Kong’ssemi-democraticlegislature, called Legco, vetoed the package.MrsLam comesinto oﬃce underthe older, even more restric-tive rules. Itdoesnothelp thatshe wasthe civil servant in chargeofthe political-reform processthatculminated in the Umbrellamovement. Ithasalwaysbeen an impossible taskto have to bal-ance the wishesofoﬃcialsin Beijingand those ofmany peoplein HongKong. NowMrsLam hasanothertough assignment: run-ninga territorybitterlydivided between those who want a lotmore democracyand those who prefernotto confrontChina. ItmayappearthatChina seeksforHongKonga colonial statusremarkablysimilarto thatunderBritish rule. MrsLam herselfrose through the civil-service ranksunderthe British, and issteeped in the traditionsofprofessionalism and integrity thattheBritish system imbued. There isanotherthrowbackto the past,too, in the factthatHongKong’stycoonsunited behind MrsLam(theydisliked MrLeung). Formostofitsrule, Britain allowed busi-nessinterestsin the colonyto hold sway.Butmuch haschanged. The lastgovernor, ChrisPatten, en-couraged democracy.

In some waysthiswasmadeworse bythe 1986 reform, which shiftedtaxesfrom individualsonto companies,which atthe time seemed lessable toavoid them. Although the high top ratemaydeterinvestment, itdoesnotreﬂectthe taxbill American companiesend uppaying. Between 2006 and 2012, two-thirdsofcompaniespaid no federal tax, ac-cordingto a studybythe GovernmentAc-countabilityOﬃce (GAO).

In2006, coal generated 49% ofAmerica’selectricity; by2015 itprovided 30%. Sixcoal-ﬁred plantshave closed since the pres-idential election. And asforjobs, eﬃcien-cy, ratherthan regulation, liesbehind mostofthe losses. America producesalmost50% more coal than itdid in 1940, butem-ploysjust13% orso ofthe miners, accordingto the BureauofLabourStatistics.Ofthe othermeasures, killingrules tolimitmethane emissionsfrom oil and gassitesisparticularlyworrying.

Thisweek, aftera bizarreepisode in which Devin Nunes, chairmanofthe House Intelligence Committee, metasource on the White House grounds, thenrushed to briefDonald Trump abouthissupposedlyexplosive ﬁndings, seniorDemocrats, and even the odd Republican,called forhim to recuse himselffrom hiscommittee’sinvestigation. (He refused.)The stuntsand partisan rowsmake itseemworryinglyunlikelythatwhatare, in ef-fect, whispersoftreason can be either sub-stantiated ordispelled.Be clearwhatthe real allegation is, andwhatitisnot. ItisnotthatVladimir Putinstole the election. No sane observerthinksthe Kremlin persuaded 63m Americanstovote forMrTrump. Even the milderversionofthatclaim—thatRussia’spropagandaand itshackingofDemocratice-mailstipped the resultin tightswingstates—can-notbe eitherconﬁrmed orrefuted. That un-veriﬁabilitymayexplain whyMrTrumpand hissupporterslike to pretend this isthe issue atstake; likewise theystress thatRussia’selectronicinterference did not al-terthe election tallies. The real fear isnar-rowand diﬀerent. AsJamesComey, direc-torofthe FBI, told MrNunes’scommitteeon March 20th, itisthatindividualsin MrTrump’scampaign mayhave co-ordinatedwith the Russiansin what, accordingtoAmerica’sintelligence agencies, wasa bidto help him win the presidency. Thatwould be a scandal whateverimpacttheRussian anticshad. Oritoughtto be.The suspicion isnotbaseless. To recapthe mounting, ifcircumstantial, evidence:Michael Flynn misled Mike Pence, the vice-president, abouthischatsduringthe presi-dential transition with Sergei Kislyak, theRussian ambassador. MrFlynn said theydidn’tdiscusssanctions, buttheydid; sincehe wasforced to resign asnational securityadviser, more detailshave emerged abouthispaid speechmakingforRussian compa-nies(and lobbyingforTurkish interests).Paul Manafortstopped beingMrTrump’scampaign manageramid consternationoverhistiesto ViktorYanukovych, the dis-graced ex-presidentofUkraine who hasbeen given refuge in Russia.

So have the attempted distractions,chieﬂyMrTrump’sdebunked ravingsaboutMrObama wiretappingTrump Tow-er. AfterMrNunes’sstrange visitsto theWhite House, duringwhich he sayshe ac-quired, then relayed, information thatsome in the Trump camp had been caughtup in legal monitoringofforeign targets,MrTrump said he felt“somewhat” vindi-cated overthe wiretappingnonsense—though even MrNuneshasrepudiated it. In short, MrTrump’steam are behavinglike men with somethingto hide. Atthebottom ofthe hunch ishisown rhetoric: acandidate, and nowa president, who hasbeen quickto criticise orinsultjudges, Re-publican senatorsand hisown intelligenceservices, butneverMrPutin. Thisdespitethe Russian president’sinvitingstatusas abogeyman, especiallyamongRepubli-cans, and despite the embarrassmentthatMrTrump’saﬃnityforhim hasentailed.The rationale oﬀered bythe president’sadvisersisthathislong-standingaim istodo a deal with MrPutin in American inter-ests, by, forexample, ﬁghtingIslamic Statetogether. Anysuch scheme maynowbescuppered: a Republican memberofCon-gresssaid thisweekthata “grand bargain”with Russia was“politicallyimpossible”.Whateveritsmerits—and theyare slim—itisa stretch to believe MrTrump farsighted-lynurtured the plan atgrave political costto himself. He hasnotextended the samepolitesse eitherto erstwhile allies, such asGermany, orto adversaries, such asChina. Hearno liesSo longasMrTrump’sﬁnancesremainopaque, the role ofRussian moneyin hisbusinesses—and hisdecision-making—will be a source ofspeculation. Maybe hegenuinelyadmiresMrPutin. Anotherex-planation forhisbiliousrage overthe Rus-sian story, which he calls“fake news”, isthathe loathesslightsofanykind: like theunderwhelmingcrowdsathisinaugura-tion, the focuson Russian meddlingseemsto wound hispride. Atthe moment, theline between psychologyand skulduggeryisimpossible to drawdeﬁnitively. Nor dothe ongoinginquiriesoﬀerearlyhope. MrNunes, a formeraide to MrTrump,seemed to dismissthe idea ofcollusion be-fore hiscommittee’shearingsbegan; heand hisfellowRepublicanshave since con-centrated on excoriatingthe leaksthatshowed up MrFlynn and others. He post-poned a hearingthisweekthatwasto fea-ture SallyYates, whom MrTrump ﬁred asactingattorney-general in January. TheWashington Postreported thatthe WhiteHouse tried to shutdown hertestimony;MrSpicerdenied that. In anycase, the com-mittee’sworkhasstalled. The parallel Sen-ate inquiryislesstarnished: itschairman,Richard Burr, and MarkWarner, hisDemo-craticcounterpart, putup a united front atapressconference on March 29th. Otherwise there isthe FBI, which MrComeysaid had been on the case since lastJuly. Counter-intelligence ispartof itsre-mit.

The optionsinclude an independentcommission, like thatwhich examined theterroristattacksofSeptember11th 2001, oracongressional panel like the Church Com-mittee, which peered into intelligence-ser-vice methodsin the 1970s. Both would re-quire bipartisan consent. Some Democratsare agitatingfora special prosecutor, whosince MrSessions’srecusal would be ap-pointed byhisdeputy. The historyof suchassignmentssuggeststhatﬁxwould not bequick, either.All inquiries, currentand putative, facetwo furtherproblems. First, conclusiveproofmaybe elusive.

Russian poweris slip-peryand tentacular, often operatingthrough businessmen instead ofoﬃcials.Especiallygiven the businessinterests ofMrTrump’steam, splittingtreachery frommere venalitymaybe tough. The secondproblem arisesfrom a purelydomestic pa-thology, forwhich MrPutin can take nocredit: feverish partisanship mayleadAmericansto diﬀeron the gravityof what-everisfound. Forexample, to some Repub-licanstacitforeknowledge ofe-mail re-leasesmightseem a price worth paying forseeingoﬀHillaryClinton.MrTrump maybe fullyexonerated. Theopposite mayhappen.

IfPresi-dentTrump were sua Eccellenza, hisgreatchallenge would be themismatch between the electoral coalition that(narrowly) carriedhim to victoryand the collection ofpartiesthathe needs in orderto passlaws. Itisnothard to imagine the factionsthat mightelectaSignorTrump in a countrywith dozens, ratherthan two, majorpolitical parties. On the right, hismostardentvoters mightcomefrom a Lawand OrderParty, a Small BusinessParty, and a Chris-tian NationalistParty(with notablyﬁerce viewson Muslim im-migration). Redrawingthe electoral map, he mightalso attractvotesfrom left-leaningpartieshostile to globalisation and happywith heftydosesofstate intervention: a Pensioner’sUnion, per-haps, and an Agrarian and Industrial League.Alasforil PresidenteTrump, in thisthought-experimentanoverlappingbutsubtlydiﬀerentcoalition won the most recentcongressional elections: a “Republican” majoritydominated by apro-businessConservative Party, a National Party(led by defencehawks), a Christian ValuesPartyand a shrink-the-governmentTaxpayers’ League. The membersofthatcongressional majorityare both supportive ofthe presidentand waryofhim. They arealso quite capable ofvotingdown hisproposals—notleast be-cause each faction had a presidential candidate itpreferred.In the real world ofWashington, DC, in the springof2017,some Trump aidesdescribe tensionsbetween theirbossand con-gressional Republicansin strikinglysimilarterms. “The Republi-can Partythinkstheywon the election with Donald Trump. No,Donald Trump won the election despite the Republican Party,”saysa White House oﬃcial. America’stwo-partysystem haslongconcealed regional andpolitical divisions. Trump admirersgo further. Theyargue thatthe presidenthasredrawn the partisan map ofAmerica in inter-estingand potentiallyconstructive ways, summoninginto beinganewcentre-rightcoalition thatfeelsthe pain ofmillions offor-merDemocraticvoters, notablyworking-classwhitesfrom “for-gotten” rustbelttownsand counties. The political map that electsmembersofCongressreﬂectsolderpartisan geographies.Such Trump admirershave a point. Theyare correctthat 2016wasa yearin which old electoral coalitionscrumbled and poten-tial newonescame into view. Theyare also rightthatthe twomain partyestablishmentsfeel tired, disunited and out oftouch.IfmembersofCongresswere willingto learn the rulesof co-alition politics, an optimistmightsee opportunitiesfor creativepoliticiansto create fresh alliancesand solve some intractablepolicypuzzles. NeitherCongressnorthe presidentseem willingto learn thewaysoffragmented coalition politics, Europe-style. Rule One isthatno faction getseverythingitwants—successrequires under-standingthe trade-oﬀsthatlie atthe heartofeveryhard dispute,and tryingto give each faction a win. Today’sCongress, underuniﬁed Republican control, seespoliticsdiﬀerently. On March24th the Speakerofthe House ofRepresentatives, Paul Ryan, hadto abandon a bill thatbegan the repeal ofthe Obamacare healthlaw, afterhisRepublican majoritysplitthree ways.One lesson ofthe health bill debacle isthattoo many mem-bersofCongressand ofthe Republican Partyare still playingwinner-takes-all politics. MrRyan blamesthe failure of theHouse bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the “growingpains” ofthe ﬁrstuniﬁed Republican governmentin ten years,and in particularthe hard-rightHouse Freedom Caucusof about30 memberswho remained in “opposition-partymode”. True,the Freedom Caucusare absolutists, butothersalso share blame.MrTrump hasspentmonthstellingvotersthathard problemsare easyto solve and thattrade-oﬀscan be avoided. The politicsofhealth care divide Americans. Theyexpose gulfsbetweenthose who favourmore redistribution orless. Theysplit thosewho thinkadultsshould be free to choose lavish, skimpy orno in-surance, from those who thinkthatmedical care isa right whichgovernmentshould guarantee. MrTrump wishessuch divisionsaway, promisinga “terriﬁc” Obamacare replacementthatwouldcostlessand oﬀer“insurance foreverybody”.Populism collides with realityThe plan written byMrRyan and endorsed byMrTrump did notcovereverybody. Itcreated winners(the rich, the young andhealthy) and a lotoflosers(older, sickerfolk, and most ofthe ad-ditional 24m people who, itisestimated, would be uninsured by2026). Democratsand moderate Republicansfrom swingdistrictscalled itshockinglyungenerous, while hardline conservativesdenounced itasanothergovernmenthandout. Ratherthanbroaden itsappeal, MrTrump and Republican leadersmade thebill more extreme to woo hardliners, strippingawayrules statingthatpoliciesmustcoversuch basicneedsashospitalisation orpreventive care, includingvaccinesand cancerscreening. Whenfactionsremained dugin, MrRyan and MrTrump pulled the bill.Trump supporterscannotgloat. When called on to honour hishealth-care promises, the presidentlacked the patience to studyhisown plan and negotiate. Instead, reportshave him askingaides: “Isthisreallya good bill?” even ashe demanded a take-it-or-leave itvote in the House. When thatfailed, MrTrump blamedthe farright, while predictingthatsoon Obamacare “will ex-plode”, forcingDemocratsto help crafta replacement.The nextitem on MrTrump’sagenda, taxreform, isjust asdivi-sive. Again the presidentbragsthathe will pull oﬀ“reallyfantas-tic” taxcutsthatleave all sideshappy—even asspecial interestsand factionsgatherto prove him wrong. With a betterman in theWhite House and a lotofluckthiscould be a remarkable mo-ment, in which newcoalitionsare formed and political logjamsbroken.

ButCuba still earns lessthan halfasmanytouristdollarsasthe Do-minican Republic, a similar-sized but lessfamoustropical neighbour.

Formanyentrepreneurs, “the ef-fective taxburden isverymuch a functionofthe veracityoftheirreportingof rev-enues,” observesBrookings, tactfully. The currencysystem is, to use a techni-cal term, bonkers. One American dollar isworth one convertible peso (CUC), whichisworth 24 ordinarypesos(CUP). Butintransactionsinvolvingthe government,the two kindsofpeso are often valuedequally. Governmentaccountsare there-fore nonsensical. Afewoﬃcialswith ac-cessto ultra-cheap hard currencymake akilling.

Theyhave come to expectthe opposite. Ro-drigo Janot, the chiefprosecutor, hasasked the supreme courtto open 83 inves-tigationsinto politicianswhom he sus-pectsoftakingpartin a scheme to extractbillionsofdollarsin bribesfrom construc-tion ﬁrms, which in turn beneﬁted frominﬂated publiccontracts.

Thataddsto the dozensofoﬃcialsalreadycaughtup in the Lava Jato(“CarWash”) investigationsinto the scan-dal, which iscentred on Petrobras, thestate-controlled oil company.Revelationsofmisdeedsbypoliticianshave turned Brazilians’ attention to thequestion ofhowto electbetterones. To-day’ssystem encouragespolitical diver-sityatthe expense ofquality. Any newpartythatsecures486,000 signatures(from a pool of143m voters) hasa right tomoneyfrom the state and to free televi-sion time. There isno nationwide votethreshold forelectinga partyto congress.Lower-house deputies, like senators, rep-resentwhole statesratherthan districts,which makescampaignsexpensive, en-couragescorruption and weakensbondsbetween votersand theirrepresentatives.The draftersofBrazil’sconstitution setup the hyper-proportional system in 1988to ensure thatall voicesin the continent-sized countrywould be heard. Ithas led tocacophony. One studyoflegislatures in137 countrieselected from 1919 to 2015found thatthe lowerhouse ofBrazil’scur-rentcongressisthe mostfragmented any-where overthatperiod. Mostofits 28 par-tieshave no ideologyordetailedprogramme. NearlyhalfofBrazilian votersforgetwhich candidate theypicked barelyamonth aftercastingtheirballots.Presidentsdare notlose track.

Infact, itsﬂawswere apparentfrom the be-ginning. Everycongresssince 1988 hassetup a commission to lookinto electoral re-form. Theyhave notmade much progress.In 1995 congressseta threshold forpartiesto enterthe legislature of5% ofthe nationalvote. The supreme courtstruckthatdown,sayingitviolated the constitution’sgoal ofproportional representation.Mostelectoral innovationshave comefrom the judiciary. In 2007 the electoral tri-bunal ruled thatcongressmen who switchpartiesmustgive up theirseats. In 2015 thesupreme courtbanned donationsto par-tiesbycorporations. The Lava Jato inqui-riesare themselvesa sortofpolitical re-form, “withoutanaesthesia”, asoneministerin MrTemer’sgovernmentputsit. Dozensoflawmakerscould be chargedbefore the election due in late 2018.The courtscannotdo itall; politicianswill have to reform themselves. They arestartingto do so. One step forward wasavote bythe senate in Novemberto ap-prove a constitutional amendmentthatwould establish a national vote thresholdand prohibitelectoral coalitions. Theseare short-lived arrangementsin which bigpartiesyield seatsto smallerones in ex-change fortheirrightsto television time.Ifthe lowerhouse approvesthe amend-mentbyOctoberthisyear, the next elec-tionscould be held underthe newrules.The nextcongress—lessfragmented andmore honest—could then make furtherchanges, includingsplittingup state-sizedconstituenciesinto districts. Butsomefearthatpoliticianswill usereform to shield themselvesfrom greateraccountability. One contentiousproposalisto give votersa choice amongparty listsratherthan individual candidates. In 2015the lowerhouse defeated a plan to intro-duce such “closed lists” bya vote of402 to21. Backbenchersfeared itwould letpartychiefspromote theircronies. The idea hascome back. Proponentssaythatclosedlistswould bolsterpartiesand save themmoney, compensatingforthe ban on cor-porate donations.

Adroughtaﬄict-ingmuch ofeastAfrica haswrecked cropsand killed animals. “I am 73, butI have averysound memoryand whatI am sayingistrue: thisisthe worst,” saysMohamedYahir, a farmerin the south-western city ofBaidoa, whose pastthree harvestshavefailed and whose livestockhasall died. Thisyear’sSomali famine maybe easi-erto tackle than the one in 2011, when al-Shabab, a viciousIslamistmilitia, held amuch largerpartofthe country. Now, aid isatleasttricklingin. Buta hangover from theformertroublesremains. Withoutmuch ofastate, and men with gunseverywhere,much ofthe Somali hinterland isstill toodangerousand expensive foraid to get towhere itisneeded.Achallenge to the worldWhatdoesthe return offamine mean forinternational organisationssuch asthe UNand forWestern countries, which providemostofthe ﬁnance foremergencyaid? TheUN’shumanitarian co-ordinator, StephenO’Brien, hassaid thatthisyearis“the larg-esthumanitarian crisis” since 1945. Notso:China’sfamine duringthe GreatLeap For-ward of1958-62 caused between 20m and55m deaths. The situationsin Yemen andSouth Sudan are notyetasshockingas theEthiopian famine of1984, when hundredsofthousandsofpeople starved even as thecountry’smilitaryregime taxed aid andspentthe proceedson a grand celebrationofthe successofMarxism. Still, today’sfaminesare real and se-vere. Sadly, in all fourcountries, the globalresponse hasbeen inadequate. Westerngovernmentsand aid agencieshave invest-ed large amountsofmoneyand energyinprovidingassistance, buttheyhave donelittle to addressthe political problems thatcause starvation. In South Sudan and Ye-men theyacquiesce to the obstaclesthatgovernmentsplace on distributingaid.Though there are 17,000 peacekeepersin South Sudan, with a Chapter7 mandate(which authorisesthe use offorce to pro-tectcivilians), the UN isloth to criticise thegovernmentthathostsitsmission. Yetthegovernmentisresponsible formostof theviolence, and the consequentdisplace-mentand starvation. “Theywantthesepeople dead,” notesa UN oﬃcial whowould neversayso publicly. In Decemberthe head ofthe Norwegian Refugee Coun-cil wasexpelled. Both the UN and otherWestern governmentsseem to have decid-ed thatitisbetterto shutup than to bekicked outand lose accessto the peopletheyare tryingto help.The situation in Yemen ismore squalid.There, the weaponsused to bomb Houthirebelsare mostlysupplied byBritain andAmerica; America hasgiven logisticsandintelligence supportto Saudi Arabia’swareﬀortfortwo years. Yetdiplomatstiptoeround criticism ofthe Saudi-led coalition.Theyinsistthattheyare pushingfor moreaid to be allowed in, butshyawayfromsanctionsthatmightforce leadersto com-ply. One UN oﬃcial describesa “conspira-cyofsilence” aboutYemen. Thatispartlytrue ofNigeria, too. The re-lease ofsome ofthe girlskidnapped byBoko Haram showsthatitispossible to ne-gotiate with the jihadists. Yetthere is“noconversation” aboutaid crossingfrontlines, accordingto one aid worker. The Ni-gerian government’srulesaboutwhereaid agenciescan go are simplyaccepted,even though starvation hasbeen a weap-on ofchoice fordefeatinginsurgencies inNigeria since the waroverBiafran seces-sion in the 1960s.Accordingto Alexde Waal ofTufts Uni-versity, formallydeclaringa famine is a“political act” thatisintended to produceaction. “Thiswill be a testcase forwhetheritworks,” he writes. In 2011, when Somaliawaslasthitbydrought, the declaration offamine forced America to change the rulesthatwere stoppingaid agenciesfrom sup-plyingfood to territoryheld byal-Shabab. Yetfewwantto intervene. In 1992George Bush seniorsentAmerican troopsto Somalia to force the local warlords to letaid in. Bill Clinton pulled the troops outaftersome ofthem were killed, and sincethen militaryintervention to end faminehasgone outoffashion. In South Sudan, acountrycreated byAmerican politicalpressure, even introducingan armsembar-go orsanctionsagainstpresidentSalva Kiirhasprovedimpossible. Similarly, Britainand America showno sign ofwantingtoforce Saudi Arabia oritsalliesto curtailtheirwarin Yemen. Butthere isno alterna-tive plan, either. And so famine, whichshould have been abolished throughoutthe world bynow, iscomingback. 7Famine deaths*, mWorld populationMid-decade, bnThe bad old days*Mid-point of estimatesfor 35 major faminesSources: Stephen Devereux;United Nations; The Economist010515201900s20s40s60s80s2010sEast AsiaEuropeSouth-East AsiaSouth AsiaAfrica02468AddisAbabaAsmaraAgadezGaoLagosAccraBamakoMogadishuIVORYCOASTBURKINAFASOMALIUINEALIBERIARANEGAL2,500,001 - 5mAcutely food-insecure population2017 estimates, m1-2.50.5-1Faminepossibleduring2017Source: FEWS NetSAUDI ARABIANIGERIANIGERCHADCARETHIOPIAKENYAUGANDASOMALIAYEMENDJIBOUTICONGOSUDANSOUTHSUDANKhartoumHodeidaBaidoaMaiduguriPanyijiar5-102.5-5750 kmSAHARAThe EconomistApril1st2017 MiddleEastandAfrica39SCENESofjubilation greeted Kurdish-ledforceswhen theyrouted IslamicStateﬁghtersfrom the cityofManbij in northernSyria lastAugust.

The governmentseemed tohave established complete control overpolitics, marginalisingthe opposition withnationalistadventuresin Ukraine and Syr-ia. VladimirPutin’sapproval ratinghad sta-bilised atmore than 80%. AfterDonaldTrump’svictoryin America, the Kremlinhad proclaimed the threatofglobal liberal-ism to be over. And yeton March 26th, 17yearsto the dayafterMrPutin wasﬁrstelected, tensofthousandsofRussians tookto the streetsin nearly100 citiesto demon-strate againstcorruption, in the largestprotestssince 2012. The protestsbegan in Vladivostok androlled acrossthe countryto Moscowand StPetersburg, which sawthe largestcrowds.Riotpolice arrested more than 1,000 peo-ple in Moscowalone. The state media ig-nored the demonstrations; the top Russiansearch engine, Yandex, manipulated its re-sultsto push reportsofthem down thepage. The Kremlin wasspeechless.The marchescame in response to a callfrom Aleksei Navalny, an oppositionleaderand anti-corruption campaignerwho wantsto run forpresidentnextyear.Despite the government’scrackdown onactivism, MrNavalnyhasdoggedlycontin-ued publishingexposésofcorruption onsocial networksand YouTube, and ex-pandinghisvolunteerorganisation.

Mean-while, MrNavalnyhasbecome the move-ment’sclearleader. On March 27th a courtsentenced him to 15 daysin jail fororganis-ingan unauthorised demonstration.The crowdsalso reﬂected a genera-tional shift. Whereasthe protestsin 2011-12had a middle-aged core, the ralliesonMarch 26th were ﬁlled with people in theirteensand 20swith fewmemoriesoftheircountrybefore MrPutin. With theirdi-verse classbackgrounds, the Kremlin can-notportraythem asspoiled cityhipsters orpitch them againstblue-collarworkers, asitdid with the protestersﬁve years ago. Un-like the 30-somethingswho tookto thestreetsbackthen, these youngerprotestershave little to lose. When the feeling’s goneWith the economyin trouble, the patrioticbuzzofMrPutin’smilitaryexploitsisfad-ing. DenisVolkovofthe Levada Centre, anindependentpollster, writesthatfor mostRussians, the annexation ofCrimea “haslostitsrelevance”. The Kremlin, which suc-cessfullysuppressed the protestsﬁve yearsago, hasfewertoolsatitsdisposal. Arrest-ingorbeatingup teenage demonstratorswould riskbringingtheirparentsonto thestreets. And one ofthe Kremlin’schiefideological weapons, the fearofreturningto the chaosofthe 1990s, isloston a gener-ation thathasno memoryofit. Another fa-vourite concept, Russia’sresurgence togreat-powerstatus, isalso oflimited use:mostofthe protesterstake itforgranted.Agroup ofanthropologistsfrom theRussian Presidential Academywho havestudied attitudesamongyoungpeople saytheylackthe fearofauthorityinstilled dur-ingthe Sovietera, and are more attachedthan theireldersto universal values such leased a ﬁlm allegingthatMrMedvedevhad used charitiesand shell companies toamassa collection ofmansions, yachtsand otherluxuries. The video hasbeenwatched 15m timeson the internet. The decision to targetMrMedvedevwasstrategic. WhereasMrPutin ispraisedforrestoringRussia’sgeopolitical power,MrMedvedevisseen asweakand held re-sponsible forRussia’seconomicwoes. Heisoften ridiculed forhistaste forWesterngadgetsand frequentgaﬀes. (“We have nomoney, butyouhangin there,” he told pen-sionersin Crimea lastyear.) He isequallydisliked bysecurity-service hardliners,such asIgorSechin, MrPutin’sclosestcon-ﬁdant, and bymoderate technocratssuchasAleksei Kudrin, a formerﬁnance minis-ter. Yetthe protestswere notrestricted toMrMedvedev. DenisLugovskoi, an engi-neeringstudentwho demonstrated inOrel, 325km (200 miles) south ofMoscow,saystheywere aimed atthe whole politi-cal elite. Although the crowdswere thinnerthanthose in Moscowin 2011-12, theywere insome respectsmore alarmingforthe Krem-lin.

Hepledged both to reverse the austerity mea-suresattached to Portugal’sbail-outduringthe euro crisisand to meetstiﬀﬁscal tar-gets. Manycalled itvoodoo economics.YetMrCosta haskepthisword. In 2016,accordingto ﬁguresreleased on March24th, hisgovernmentcutthe budgetdeﬁcitbymore than halfto justunder2.1% ofGDP(see chart), the lowestsince Portugal’stran-sition to democracyin 1974.

Mário Cen-teno, the ﬁnance minister, wantsthe EUtofree Portugal from itsexcessive-deﬁcit pro-cedure, a disciplinarymechanism used toenforce the euro area’sﬁscal rules. “Portu-gal would then join the club ofsuccessful‘turnaround’ storiesin the euro zone’spe-riphery, alongside Ireland and Spain,” saysFederico Santi ofthe Eurasia Group, anoth-erconsultingﬁrm.

Everyrating agen-cyapartfrom DBRS, a small Canadian ﬁrm,hasclassed Portugal’ssovereign debtasjunksince the beginningofthe country’sbail-outprogramme, which lasted from2011to 2014. MrCenteno thinkstheirfailureto recognise the strength ofthe recoveryamountsto unfairtreatmentand burdensthe governmentwith high borrowingcosts. Interestrates, he complains, absorbmore ofPortugal’sbudgetthan ofanyoth-erEUcountry’s. Ratingupgrades, however, maynot beimminent. The European Commissionwarned thisweekthatPortugal’sbanksre-main fragile. The governmentplansto in-ject€2.5bn ($2.7bn) to recapitalise state-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos, thecountry’slargestbank, which could in-crease thisyear’sbudgetdeﬁcit.

MrCosta blamesthe EUand the IMFforfailingto provide enough aid to the ﬁnancial sec-torduringthe bail-out, leavinghisgovern-ment, which hasspent€4.4bn on bankres-cues, to clearup the mess. Buteconomistsalso remain concerned aboutpublicdebt,which inched up to 131% ofGDPlastyeardespite the shrinkingdeﬁcit. “The country’shigh debtlevelsremainthe elephantin the room,” saysMrBarroso.Should the euro zone face a shock, such asMarine Le Pen winningFrance’spresiden-tial election, Portugal isthe country mostlikelyto face a debtcrisis, he thinks.

ThisyearMs LePen hasbeen to America (where she wasseen sippingcoﬀee in Trump Towerin NewYork), Germany, Lebanon and Chad. Em-manuel Macron, the youngcentristwho istied with herforﬁrstplace in the polls, hasbeen to Algeria, Britain, Germany, Jordanand Lebanon, in partto reach outto expatvotersand donors.MsLe Pen’strip to the Kremlin wasrisky. She needsto broaden hersupport be-yond hercurrentone-quarterofthe elec-torate byappealingto more moderate vot-ers. She hopesto poach some fromFrançoisFillon, the centre-rightRepublicancandidate, who hasbeen dogged bycor-ruption claims.

MostFrench votersare notfond of Rus-sia. In a Pewsurveyin 2015, 70% said theyviewed Russia unfavourablyand 85% didnottrustMrPutin.

A strat-egistforMsLe Pen’steam recentlytravelledto London to tell investorsthatherplan toquitthe euro and hold a referendum on EUwithdrawal need be no more disruptivethan Brexit. Thatwould hardlybe reassur-ingeven ifitwere true, which itis not. MsLe Pen saysthatwhatmattersis notwhetheryouare leftorright, butwhetheryouare a nationalistora globalist. MrMac-ron agrees.

Barelyhalfa yearago the European Union’s(EU’s) trade policywasa mess. Amuch-touted trade and investmentpartnership (TTIP) with theUnited Stateswason life support, trashed byNGOsand consum-ergroups, and disowned bysome ofthe politicianswho hadasked foritin the ﬁrstplace. Adeal with cuddlyCanada (CETA)barelysurvived an encounterwith a preeningregional parlia-mentin Belgium. Governmentswere scrappingoverhowto re-spond to state-subsidised Chinese steel, and Britain, among theclub’sweightiestpro-trade voices, had voted to leave the EU, a de-cision made ﬂesh bythe government’sArticle 50 letterthisweek. And now? Trade is“goingto be huge in the comingmonths”,saysa European diplomat. Hisword choice isa reminder ofthereason forthe change: Donald J. Trump. One ofthe Americanpresident’sﬁrstactswasto withdrawfrom the Trans-PaciﬁcPart-nership (TPP), a trade deal coveringa dozen countriesaround thePaciﬁcRim. MrTrump complainsaboutGermany’strade surplus,and hisadministration hintsthatitwill ignore rulings from theWorld Trade Organisation. The leaderofthe free world is pullingup the drawbridge, and the EU(which negotiatestrade deals onbehalfofitsmembergovernments) hasspotted an opportunity. Betterstill, MrTrump’sinward turn hasleftAmerica’sotherspurned partnersseekingnewfriends. The prime candidate isJa-pan, the world’sthird-largestnational economy. Bitterlydisap-pointed byMrTrump’sdecision to quitthe TPP, Japan happens tohave been negotiatinga trade deal with the EUsince 2013. Cue anunexpected burstofJapanese Europhilia. LastweekShinzo Abe,the prime minister, toured European capitalsto gladhand hiscounterpartsand toutthe virtuesofglobalisation. Japan and theEU, he said in Brusselsbefore hisdelighted hosts, would “showtothe world the ﬂagoffree trade asa model”. The two sideshope toconclude theirtalksthisyear. Ifthe boostto growth would be lessthan stellar—the EU projectsa long-term GDP increase of0.76%—adeal between two economicgiantswould still demonstrate tothe world thatglobalisation can survive an American retreat. And whystop with Japan? MrTrump’selection mayhaveplaced TTIP in the deep freeze, butthere are plentymore potentialpartnersforEurope waitingin the wings, includingMercosur, aLatin American grouping. Mexico, neverfarfrom a Trumpian ton-gue-lashing, isanothercandidate. Norissuch optimism limitedto trade. IfMrTrump, who thisweekscrapped some ofBarackObama’sclean-energyrules, withdrawsfrom the Parisclimate-change deal, Europe mayseekto deepen itsenvironmental part-nership with China. “Positive globalisation” isthe newmantra. True, Europe’strade naysayershave hardlygiven up the ﬁght;EUdealswith Singapore and Vietnam will face trickyvotes in theEuropean Parliamentlaterthisyear.

In 1981some 42% ofthe world’spop-ulation were extremelypoor, according tothe World Bank. Theywere notjustpoorerthan a large majorityoftheircompatriots,asmanyrich countriesdeﬁne povertyamongtheirown citizenstoday, butabso-lutelydestitute. Atbest, theyhad barelyenough moneyto eatand payfornecessi-tieslike clothes. Atworst, theystarved. Since then the numberofpeople in ab-solute povertyhasfallen byabout1bn andthe numberofnon-poorpeople hasgoneup byroughly4bn. By2013, the mostrecentyearforwhich reliable data exist, just 10.7%ofthe world’spopulation waspoor(themodern yardstickfordestitution isthat aperson consumeslessthan $1.90 a dayat2011purchasing-powerparity). Poverty hasalmostcertainlyretreated furthersince2013: the World Bank’sﬁnger-in-the-windestimate for2016 is9.1%. Homi Kharasofthe BrookingsInstitution, a think-tank, cal-culatesthatsomeone escapesextremepovertyevery1.2 seconds. Thisisimpressive and unprecedented.world historyisdrawingto a close. Theshare ofpeople livingin absolute povertywill almostcertainlynotdecline asquicklyin the future—and notbecause itwill hitzero and therefore have nowhere to fall.Even asthe global proportion ofpoor peo-ple continuesto driftslowlydownwards,large pocketsofpovertywill persist, andsome ofthem are likelyto swell. The waron wantisaboutto settle into a period ofgrindingbattlesin the trenches. Until recentlythe world’spoorestpeo-ple could be divided into three biggroups:Chinese, Indian and everybodyelse. In1987 China isthoughtto have had 660mpoorpeople, and India 374m. The concen-tration ofdestitution in those two coun-trieswasin one sense a boon, because inboth placesbettereconomicpoliciesal-lowed legionsto scramble outofpoverty.Atthe lastcount(2011in India; 2013 in Chi-na) India had 268m paupersand China just25m. Both countriesare much more popu-lousthan theywere 30 yearsago. Some ofthe decline in povertyin Chinaand India isartiﬁcial, caused bymore accu-rate household surveysand newestimatesofpurchasingpower. Butmostofitis real.In both countries, economicgrowth hasbeneﬁted the pooraswell asthe rich, peas-antsaswell ascity-dwellers: the magic in-gredientin China’spoverty-reduction for-mula since the 1980shasbeen notitsfactoriesbutitshighlyproductive smallfarms.

Economichistoriansreckon thatittookBritain abouta century, from the 1820stothe 1920s, to cutextreme povertyfrommore than 40% ofitspopulation to below10%.

Africa isasstudded with examplesoffailure asAsia isﬁlled with successstories. LookatNigeria,saysKaushikBasu, an economistatCor-nell University. In 1985 the share ofNigeri-ansbelowthe international povertylinewasestimated to be 45%—a lowerpropor-tion than in China orIndonesia. NowNige-ria hasa much highershare ofpoorpeoplethan eithercountry. The World Food Pro-gramme, an arm ofthe UN, issendingbagsofgrain to the lawless, hungrynorth-east(see page 37).Sub-Saharan Africa isnotactually go-ingbackwards. Itsabsolute povertyratehasfallen from 54% in 1990 to 41% in 2013.Butbecause Africa’spopulation isgrowingso quickly—byabout2.5% a year, comparedwith 1% forAsia—and because the povertyrate isdecliningonlyslowly, the number ofpoorAfricansishigherthan itwasin the1990s. With more destitute inhabitantsthan anyotherregion, sub-Saharan Africanowdrivesthe global povertyrate. Working towards welfareThatisbad news, because African povertyisparticularlyintractable. The ﬁrst pro-blem isthateconomicgrowth hasbeenweak, consideringthe continent’sswellingpopulation. Accordingto the IMF, since2000 GDP perhead atpurchasing-powerparityhasdoubled in sub-Saharan Africa;in emergingAsia italmostquadrupled.Oil-producingstatessuch asAngola andNigeria have gone through boomsthathave done little to cutdeep poverty—and,anyway, have been followed bybusts.Asecond problem isthatmanyAfricangovernmentsare ﬂimsy, incompetent, au-thoritarian orrapacious. The OECD, a clubofmostlyrich countries, counts56 placesin the world as“fragile”—mostlycountries,butincludingthe WestBankand GazaStrip. Fully36 are in Africa. The continent isnotasravaged bywarasitwasin the 1980sand 1990s, butitstill hassome disastrouscountries, such asthe DemocraticRepublicofCongo and South Sudan, and a largernumberthatoccasionallylapse into politi-cal violence, such asIvoryCoastand Ken-ya. Violence both createspovertyand dis-tractsgovernmentsfrom the workofdealingwith it. The third problem isthatpoorpeople inAfrica are commonlyverypoorindeed.Compare Rwanda with Bangladesh. Bothare low-income countries; both are reason-ablycompetentlygoverned; both havegrown well in the pastfewyears. ButRwanda’spoorare much poorerthanBangladesh’s. Manygetbyon around $1aday(see chart3). Suppose, saysLaurenceChandyofUNICEF, thatRwanda experi-ences5% growth perhead everyyearforten yearsand thisgrowth isspread evenly.Atthe end ofthatimpressive run, a quarterofRwandanswould still be belowthe ab-solute povertyline. Rwanda isin a worse position thanBangladesh—exceptin one sense. Becauseithasa large lump ofpeople belowthe$1.90 povertyline, Rwanda oughtto beable to pull evermore people overthe lineforeverypointofgrowth (assumingthegrowth isevenlyspread). In Bangladeshthe opposite istrue. Ithasa lump of peoplewho are justclearofpovertyand a dimin-ishingproportion justbelowthe line whocan easilybe pulled over. Bangladesh hasmade excellentprogressagainstpoverty sofar. Itwill probablymake slowerprogressfrom nowon. India isin a similarposition to Bangla-desh, pointsoutMrBasu, who used to bethe chiefeconomicadviserto India’sgov-ernment. With huge numbersofpeoplewho are barelyoutofpoverty, itnowneedsto preventnear-paupersfrom fallingback, while also draggingthe poorest outofdestitution fasterthan economicgrowthalone could do the job. In short, India and countrieslike itneedproperwelfare systems. Theyare still somewayfrom gettingthem. In general, govern-mentspendingisa smallershare ofGDP inlower-middle-income countriesthan inpoorerorricherones. South Asia isespe-ciallymean compared with Latin America.In 2014 India spentjust0.7% ofitsGDP onsocial safety-netprogrammes. Three yearsearlierBrazil had spent2.4% ofitsGDP onsuch programmes. And halfofIndia’sspendingwenton rural public-workspro-jectsand feedingchildren in schools. Bra-zil’spaymentswere nearlyall cash trans-fers, which are more eﬃcient. India hastrimmed some spectacularlyill-targetedhandouts, such asfuel subsidies, and ismusingabouta universal basicincome,made possible byitsbiometricidentitysystem, which nowcoversan astounding1.1bn people. Butthatisstill talk. Asextreme povertydisappearsevery-where exceptin Africa and in Asian coun-trieswith weakwelfare systems, the cam-paign to eradicate itislikelyto slow down.The World Bankreckonsthatabout4% ofthe world’spopulation will still be poor in2030 ifeconomiescontinue to growasquicklyastheyhave in the pastten yearsand poorpeople’sincomesgrowatthesame rate aseveryone else’s. The numberofpoorpeople mighteven rise a little. The last-mile problemAfterdecadesofastonishingprogress, aspell ofsluggish poverty-reduction wouldbe a greatdisappointment. Amongotherthings, itwould probablymean a promi-nenttargetbeingmissed. In 2000 themembersofthe UN agreed to tryto cutpovertyto halfofthe 1990 level by2015.Progresswasso quickthatthe world gotthere atleastﬁve yearsearly. So two newtargetshave been set—the ﬁrstofa long listof“sustainable developmentgoals”. Theworld isnowsupposed to cutthe absolutepovertyrate to 9% by2020 and 3% by2030.The ﬁrstofthese targetscan and probablywill be hit. The second looksoutofreach. Still, a global targetforreducing abso-lute povertyseemsincreasinglybeside thepoint, because povertyislessand less glo-bal. In the mid-19th centuryeveryconti-nenthad a large population ofpoorpeo-ple. Now, afterabsolute povertyhasbeenvirtuallyeradicated in one region after an-other—Europe, North America, LatinAmerica and nowEastAsia—ithasbecomeaplague speciﬁcto South Asia and sub-Sa-haran Africa. Itseemslikelythatpovertywill become evermore African. Itispossible to imagine a future inwhich the global povertyrate continues todrop even aspovertybecomesmore en-trenched in a fewunluckycountries,scarred bywarand bad government. Thatwould be a huge improvementon the past,buthard to cheer.

Founded in 1886, itisthe companythatbroughtelectricity tothe masses. When youplugin yourtoasterorﬂip yourlightswitch, youhave GeorgeWestinghouse’salternating-currentsys-tem to thank. In the 21stcenturythe ﬁrmseemed poised to unleash a newrevolu-tion in nuclearenergy. ItsAP1000 pressur-ised waterreactorwassupposed to makenuclearplantssimplerand cheapertobuild, helpingto jump-startprojects inAmerica and around the world. Butthose nuclearambitionshave goneawry. On March 29th the ﬁrm ﬁled forChapter11bankruptcyin NewYork. Itstroubleshave been a runningsore atTosh-iba, itsJapanese parent, a headache for itscreditors, and the latestbad tidings foranuclearindustrybesetwith problems. Toshiba wastriumphantin 2006 whenitpaid $5.4bn forWestinghouse aftera bid-dingwar, beatingoutGeneral Electric(founded byGeorge Westinghouse’sarch-rival, ThomasEdison). Around the sametime, Southern and SCANA, two bigutili-tiesbased in Georgia and South Carolina,respectively, chose the AP1000 design fornewnuclearplants. Butthese American projectssoon facedthe problemsthathave longplagued nuc-learconstruction. In Westinghouse’sbank-ruptcyﬁling, the companyexplainsa dis-mal chain reaction. Unexpected newsafetyand otherrequirementsfrom Amer-ican regulatorscaused delaysand addi-tional costs. Thatsparked a ﬁghtbetweenthe utilities, Westinghouse and itscon-struction contractor, a subsidiaryof Chica-go Bridge & Iron (CB&I), aboutwho shouldbearthem. The brawl exacerbated delays. In an attemptto push the projects for-ward, Westinghouse acquired CB&I’ssub-sidiary, then became mired in litigationoverthe termsofthe deal. Italso signednewcontractswith consortia led bySouth-ern and SCANA, agreeingto shoulderun-anticipated costs. Those costsmounted.Construction continued swallowingmoretime and labourthan Westinghouse hadhoped. In FebruaryToshiba announced a$6.1bn write-down forthe two Americanprojects. Stephen Byrd ofMorgan Stanley, abank, anticipatesthatthe total costs oftheplants, ifcompleted, would be abouttwiceWestinghouse’soriginal estimate. The nuclearbusinesshasimperilledToshiba itself. The company’shealth hadimproved in the aftermath ofa huge ac-countingscandal in 2015, butitsnuclearunitdragged itbackdown. Toshiba nowappearsdesperate to shrinkasa waytogrow. ItwaseagerforWestinghouse to ﬁleforbankruptcybefore the end ofitsﬁnan-cial year. Italso intendsto sell its lucrativechip business. Shrinkingmightindeedhelp Toshiba focuson itsstrengths, as aspecialistin the design and production ofheavymachinessuch asturbines, coolers,motorsand control systems. Butthe Westinghouse bankruptcyisunlikelyto be neat. Southern and SCANAmaygo to courtto seekpaymentfromToshiba: the Japanese companyhasguar-anteed ¥650bn ($5.9bn) againstthe spiral-lingcostofthe projects. AnysuggestionthatToshiba isbilkingthe utilities wouldangerDonald Trump. The AP1000 projects’future wasrecentlydiscussed in a meetingofoﬃcialsfrom America and Japan. The degree ofdiplomaticfriction de-pendson whathappensto the projects.Westinghouse expectsto continue work-ingon the reactorsin Georgia and SouthCarolina asbankruptcyproceedingsgo on,butthe utilitiesmayabandon the plants orseekanotherﬁrm to build them. Therehave been rumoursthatKorea ElectricPower, a state-controlled utility, might takeover, butWestinghouse’ssteep lossesmaykeep itaway. “Thishasbankrupted Wes-tinghouse,” saysMrByrd. “Whywould an-otherﬁrm step into thatsituation?” The future forotherAP1000 reactorslooksbleak. Aplantin China isyears be-hind schedule.

In Tokyo Masayoshi Son, thebossofSoftBank, a Japanese telecomsgroup, isstarting an invest-mentfund worth $100bn which, he hopes, will make him theWarren Buﬀettoftechnology. “Masa” isno strangerto risky bets:SoftBankwasan earlyinvestorin Alibaba, a Chinese e-commercecompany, and hassunk$22bn in Sprint, a strugglingAmerican te-lecomsﬁrm. Nowhe hasbeen seized bythe kind ofUtopian feverthatwould make the Sage ofOmaha choke on hisCherryCoke.MrSon, who is59, believesthatthe world will soon encounterwhatisknown asthe Singularity, the pointatwhich artiﬁcial in-telligence exceedsthe human kind. The brainsofpeople and ma-chineswill become enmeshed (see page 67). Everyperson willhave over1,000 deviceslinked bya seamlessglobal network,with the data analysed bymachinesin the cloud. Aswell assmartglasses, people will wearsmartshoesand everycar andwashingmachine will linkup to the web. Thisinternetrevolution, saysMrSon, will be more momentousthan the ﬁrst.He hasbegun makingacquisitions. Lastyearhe spent$31bnbuyingBritain’sARMHoldings, which designsthe chipsin mo-bile devices(itwill be owned jointlybySoftBankand the fund).He also invested a total of$2bn in OneWeb and Intelsat, two sat-ellite-technologyﬁrmsthataim to launch thousandsof micro-satellitesto orbitthe Earth providinghigh-speed internet access.Tech ﬁrmsaround the world are bracingformore swoops byMrSon, who sayshisaim isto build a businessempire lasting 300years. Whathe doesn’tmention isthathe also wantsto prove be-yond all doubtthathisfortune isdue to skill, notone luckydeal. MrSon believeshe hasanticipated successive paradigm shiftsin technology. The son ofan ethnic-Korean pigfarmer, whosechildhood wasspentin a shackin southern Japan, Masa weptjoyfullywhen, asa teenager, he ﬁrstsawa picture of a microchip.He learned programmingwhile atthe UniversityofCalifornia,Berkeley, then in the 1980ssoldsoftware in Japan. He wasan earlyinvestorin internetﬁrms, buyinga share ofYahoo in 1995 and theAlibaba stake in 1999. Laterhe invested in mobile telecoms, ﬁrst in2006 with hispurchase ofVodafone’sJapanese mobile arm andthen ofSprintin 2013. NowSoftBankishuge, with an enterprisevalue (itsmarketvalue plusitsnetdebt) of$193bn.YetMrSon’scareerisstill deﬁned byAlibaba. In 1999 he wasvisited in Tokyo byJackMa and Joseph Tsai, co-founders ofaﬂedglingwebsite in Hangzhou. MrSon tapped on a calculator astheyhaggled and agreed thatSoftBankwould buy30% oftheyoungﬁrm for$20m. The deal was“based on mysense ofsmell”,MrSon said later. NowAlibaba’smarketvalue is$270bn, and,aftersellingsome shareslastyear, SoftBankstill owns 28%.About95% ofSoftBank’smarketvalue isaccounted forby theAlibaba stake, so the restofwhatitdoes, from telecomsto ven-ture capital, maybe worth little, once debtsare deducted. MrSonsaysthatSoftBankhasmade an internal rate ofreturn of 43% onall itsotherinvestments, excludingAlibaba, butthe basis ofhiscalculationsisunclear. There have been triumphs—SoftBankmade $5bn buyingand sellingSupercell, a Finnish gaming ﬁrm,between 2013 and 2016. Butthe group hasproduced little cash-ﬂow, and MrSon’sdealshave leftitwith $110bn ofnetdebt.So MrSon hasa minorityinvestmentin a greatﬁrm, but hasyetto build one himselffrom scratch.

ButMr Sonhopesthatthe Trump administration will be more amenable.The alternative ispartiallyto bypassSoftBank, which iswhatthe new$100bn fund achieves. MrSon will have more discretionoverwhatto buy, free ofgrumblingpublicshareholders. Outsideinvestorswill give him huge ﬁrepower. Saudi Arabia’spublicin-vestmentfund, forexample, haspromised to give him buckets ofcash. The fund and itsdebtswill be keptoﬀSoftBank’sbooks.MasachismInvestorsin the newvehicle and ownersofSoftBanksharesshould have three worries. First, while MrSon’sideasstand outfortheirintensity, theyare notentirelyoriginal. Others in techshare hisvision ofubiquitous, web-linked deviceswith theirdata crunched bymachines, so the valuesofﬁrmsinvolved inthese areasare sky-high; SoftBankpaid 71timesearningsforARM.Second, MrSon can lose focus. Some ofthe startupshe particular-lyadmires, such asUberand Airbnb, are onlylooselyrelated tohisnotion ofthe internet. Othersare even more tangential. OnMarch 20th SoftBankboughta $300m stake in WeWork, a trendyoﬃce-rental ﬁrm with a dizzyingvaluation.The third worryisgovernance. MrSon’smind skipsfrom oneobsession to the next.

Itisclearthatone man with amessianicstreakwill dominate the fund aswell asthe running ofSoftBank. MrSon’sdual role also producesconﬂictsofinterest: ifthere isa juicydeal, who beneﬁts—the fund orthe ﬁrm?ForMrSon, these are quibblesthatwill fade into irrelevanceoverhis300-yearhorizon.

Butthe real proﬁt, theyfound,came on theirreturn, when theybroughtChinese teasand porcelain to America. Asothershipsfollowed in itswake, the pat-tern became clear. Americanswantedmore from China than Chinese wantedfrom America, and the diﬀerence wasmade up with a steadyoutﬂowofsilverfrom America into China.

Inrecentyearsithasreached a record size (seechart1). When Xi Jinping, China’spresi-dent, meetsDonald Trump—a meetingisreportedlyplanned in Florida earlyinApril—the deﬁcitwill top the agenda. In hisrun to the White House, MrTrump prom-ised a combative stance againstChina ontrade. Some expectAmerica to slap puni-tive tariﬀson Chinese goods, triggering anall-outtrade war. Othersthinka grand bar-gain thatdefusestensionsispossible.ManyAmerican businesses, bruised intheirdealingswith China, cautiously wel-come a harderline.

Americaand China are bound togetherbycross-borderﬂowsofgoods, cash, people andideasthatare biggerthan ever. These tieshave greatlybeneﬁted the two countries’prosperity. Arupture would be severelydamagingforboth.The original sin, forMrTrump’smosthawkish advisers, isthe trade imbalance.Before China joined the World Trade Orga-nisation (WTO) in 2001, China accountedforlessthan a quarterofAmerica’stotaltrade deﬁcit; overthe pastﬁve years, ithasmade up two-thirds. PeterNavarro, head ofMrTrump’snewNational Trade Council,seesthe deﬁcitasa dragon America’secon-omy. Close it, he argues, and America’sGDPwill be bigger. And he seesa way to doso: take on China overitsunfairtrade prac-tices, from currencymeddlingto exportsubsidies.

About a ﬁfthofitsexportsgo to America, equating tonearly4% ofChinese GDP. Lessthan atenth ofAmerican exportsgo to China,worth lessthan 1% ofAmerican GDP. But aﬁghtwould also hitAmerica hard. No oth-ercountrycould easilyreplace China inmakingmanyofthe products, from toys totextiles, thatﬁll American shops.

Ifhedoes, though, he will soon learn that tradeisnotthe onlyshowin town. Investmentgetsmuch lessattention butisalso vital tothe relationship. Startwith a myth—thatChina can bank-ruptthe American government. Overthepastdecade, China hasinvested more than$1trn in Treasuries. Atitspeak, Americaowed more moneyto China than to any-where else. Punditsfretthat, were China todump itsbonds, American interestrateswould shootup and the dollarplummet.Butthatisto misunderstand the ﬁnan-cial mechanics. The Federal Reserve hasdemonstrated thatitcan buyfarmore gov-ernmentbondsthan anyforeign ordomes-ticholdercan sell. China thuscannot dic-tate interestratesin America, much lesspush itinto penury. And the volatility ofthe dollarisalso a Chinese concern. Be-cause Chinese companiesborrowedheavilyabroad, dollarstrength hasmadetheirdebtsmore costlyin yuan terms.Financial exposure goesthe other way,too. Backin 2015 the Fed wasplanningtoembarkon a seriesofinterest-rate in-creases. In the end itmanaged to deliver itssecond rise onlyatthe veryend of2016. Jit-tersoverChina’seconomyhad stayed itshand.

AnxietyaboutChinahastriggered two ofthe three mostrecent“risk-oﬀ” episodesin global markets, ascaptured bythe VIX,a measure ofstock-marketvolatility, popularlyknown as the“feargauge”. Thisisthe crucial point: itisnotthatChina hasthe ﬁnancial upperhand overAmerica, orvice versa; itis thattheyare increasinglyjoined atthe hip.Mutuallyassured destructionAnd these are justthe ﬁnancial linkages,which remain limited byChina’scapitalcontrols. Lookatthe physical investmenttiesbetween China and America and themutual vulnerabilitiesare even more glar-ing.

MrMa, foun-derofAlibaba, a Chinese e-commercegiant, boasted thathisshoppingportalwould create 1m jobsin America, givingsmall businessesand farmersa platform toexportto Asia. The promise wasfar-fetched (MrTrump mightappreciate that).Butthere wasa kernel oftruth: Chinese in-vestorsare onlygettingstarted in America.Were itjusta question ofmoney, theseinvestmenttrendsoughtto be the clincher,givingAmerica and China everyreason tostayon each other’sgood side. Butinvest-mentcannotbe divorced from power, andthatposescomplications. Mostobviousare national-securityconcerns. Both Chinaand America have become more active inrestrictingeach other’stechnologyandblockingdealsthattheyfearmightcom-promise theirsecurity.Butcommercial competition castsaneven biggershadow. China and Americaare increasinglybuttingheads. “Made inChina 2025”, an industrial plan unveiled in2015, isindicative ofhowChina isgunningforindustriesthatAmerica and other for-eign countrieshave dominated. Chinaaimsto become a leaderin ten strategicsectors, rangingfrom next-generation ITtoagricultural machinery.Criticsin America warn thatChina’sstate-driven model foradvancingin theseindustrieswill cause damage around theworld. TheirworryisthatChina will de-ploymuch the same industrial policythatithasused in sectorsfrom wind power tohigh-speed rail: pressure on foreign ﬁrmsto share technology; protection oflocalﬁrms; targetsto phase outimports; andgenerousstate funding. “Thiscould leadnotonlyto China takingovermarketsharebut, because ofitsscale, destroying entirebusinessmodels,” saysScottKennedyofthe Centre forStrategicand InternationalStudies, a think-tankin Washington,DC.

The two countriesare alreadyspurringeach otherto innovate. Americanventure capitalistsare well embedded inthe software clusterin Beijingand thehardware ecosystem in Shenzhen, a cityinsouthern China. American private-equityﬁrmsare prominentin China, makingbetson industriesrangingfrom health care toenergy. American multinationalsused tobuild shinyR&Dcentresin Shanghai andBeijingto please oﬃcials, butdid little orig-inal workin them. Now, ﬁrmsranging fromindustrial conglomerateslike GEto biotechgiantssuch asAmgen are doingsome oftheircutting-edge research in China.China’smostinventive ﬁrmsare also in-vestingheavilyin America in search of tal-entand newpatents.

Butitislikely tobe a longtime before thathappens. Itwould help ifthe governmentscould seeeye to eye—in particular, iftheycould agreeon a long-stalled bilateral investmenttreaty; and iftheycould reach an under-standingon trade before theirdisagree-mentsthreaten the WTO itself.Both outcomes, however, are highly un-likely.

Thisiscasting adeepeningcloud overthe coal industry. Two reasonsexplain the loomingover-capacityin countriesrangingfrom Chinaand India to Australia (South-EastAsia re-mainshooked on coal). Firstly, electricitydemand isstagnant, fallingorgrowing lessstronglythan expected, which hasput con-siderable ﬁnancial strain on powerplantsburningcoal.

TheS&P500 indexhad gone more than 100dayswithouta 1% decline, the longestsuch streaksince 1995. And the setbackshould notbe exaggerated. The S&P500remainswell above itspre-election level,compared with the dollar, which has giv-en up around halfitsgains. The ten-yearTreasury-bond yield, which hit2.62% onMarch 13th, hasdropped backto 2.38%.The immediate cause ofthe retreatseemed to be the failure ofMrTrump torepeal hispredecessor’shealth-care bill.Thatlogicwashardlya greatadvertise-mentforcapitalism, implyingthatthefewerAmericanshad accessto health in-surance, the happierinvestorswould be.Butthe broaderrationale seemed to bethat, ifthe Republicanscould notmeetthiscampaign promise, then theyalsowould struggle to push through the taxcutswhich investorswere countingon topush up corporate proﬁtsand improveeconomicgrowth. Abasketofshares ofﬁrmsthatpaythe highesttaxrates asaproportion ofproﬁts, compiled byGold-man Sachs, an investmentbank, isnowlowerthan itwasbefore the election.On itsown thischange ofmood madeinvestorslooknaive. MrTrump came tooﬃce asa political neophyte with a repu-tation forbeingsketchyon policydetail.Hisdiﬀerenceswith the congressional Re-publican Partywere made clearthrough-outthe campaign. No one should have ex-pected a smooth roll-outofpolicy. Nor isalowercorporate-taxrate a sure route togrowth. Britain hascutitsmarginal ratefrom 28% to 20% since 2010, withoutspark-inga runawayboom.In anycase, given the lengthynegotia-tionsneeded to create a taxpackage, andthe inevitable lagbefore the policyhas aneﬀecton the economy, itwould probablybe 2018 before the impactofa ﬁscal stimu-lusbecame clear. And ifanypickup ingrowth isdelayed, then the Federal Re-serve mayhave lessneed to push interestratesup asrapidly, weakeningthe appealofthe dollarforinternational investors.The latestforecastfrom the tracking modelofthe Atlanta Fed suggeststhatﬁrst-quar-tergrowth in America mayhave been onlyan annualised 1%.With analystsforecasting12% growth inS&P500 companies’ proﬁtsthisyear, inotherwords, there wasscope fordisap-pointmentforthe stockmarket. Thatwasespeciallyso since American sharesaretradingon a cyclicallyadjusted price-earn-ingsratio of29, a level exceeded onlyin theboomsofthe late 1920sand 1990s.Globally, however, stockmarketsarenotdependenton MrTrump to pushthrough hisagenda. Theirmood started tobrighten lastspringasconcernsabout“secularstagnation” and a hard landingforthe Chinese economybegan to dissi-pate. Bythe end of2016 Asian exportswere pickingup, commoditypriceswerereboundingand growth forecastsfor 2017were beingrevised higher.So investorsstarted the yearin opti-misticmood. ArecentsurveyoffundmanagersbyAbsolute Strategy, a researchﬁrm, found that74% expectglobal equi-tiesto produce betterreturnsthan govern-mentbondsoverthe next12 monthsand70% expectglobal proﬁtsto rise.

So the marketsmighthave been doingverywell even ifthe presidential electionhad produced a diﬀerentoutcome.

Within 50 yearscarsand tractorsmade shortworkofequine livelihoods. Some futuristssee a cautionarytale forhu-manityin the fate ofthe horse: itwaseconomicallyindispens-able until itwasn’t. The common retortto such concernsisthathumansare farmore cognitivelyadaptable than beastsof bur-den. Yetasrobotsgrowmore nimble, humanslookincreasinglyvulnerable. Anewworkingpaperconcludesthat, between 1990and 2007, each industrial robotadded perthousand workers re-duced employmentin America bynearlysixworkers. Humanitymaynotbe sentoutto pasture, butthe parallel with horses isstilluncomfortablyclose. Robotsare justone small partofthe technological wavesqueezingpeople. The International Federation ofRobotics de-ﬁnesindustrial robotsasmachinesthatare automatically con-trolled and re-programmable; single-purpose equipmentdoesnotcount. The worldwide population ofsuch creaturesis below2m; America hasslightlyfewerthan two robotsper1,000 work-ers(Europe hasa bitmore than two). Buttheirnumbers are grow-ing, asisthe range oftaskstheycan tackle, so ﬁndings ofrobot-dri-ven job lossare worth takingseriously. The paper’sauthors, Daron Acemogluofthe MassachusettsInstitute ofTechnology(MIT) and Pascual Restrepo ofBostonUniversity, are careful to exclude confoundingcausesasbesttheycan. Theirresultsare notdriven bya fewrobot-intensive re-gionsorindustries, and are distinctfrom the eﬀectof trade withChina, oroﬀshoringin general. Increased robotdensity doesnotseem to raise employmentamonganygroup ofworkers, eventhose with universityeducation. Since relativelyfewindustrialrobotsare in use in the American economy, the total job lossfromrobotisation hasbeen modest: between 360,000 and 670,000. Bycomparison, analysispublished in 2016 found thattrade withChina between 1999 and 2011mayhave leftAmerica with 2mfewerjobsthan itwould otherwise have had. Yet, ifthe Chinatrade shockhaslargelyrun itscourse, the robotera is dawning.Economicallyspeaking, thisshould notbe a problem. Auto-mation should yield savingsto ﬁrmsorconsumerswhich can bespenton othergoodsorservices. Labourliberated bytechnologyshould gravitate toward tasksand jobsin which humansretainan advantage. Yetthatshould also have been true ofhorses. Theuse oftractorsin agriculture rose sharplyfrom the 1910sto the1950s, and horseswere displaced in vastnumbers. Butsome use-ful horse-workremained (asindeed itdoestoday). The diﬃcultyfacinghorseswasin reallocatingthe huge numbersdisplaced bytechnologyto placeswhere theycould still be ofuse. The marketworked to ease the transition. Asdemand for tra-ditional horse-workfell, so did horse prices, byabout 80% be-tween 1910 and 1950. Thisdrop slowed the pace ofmechanisationin agriculture, butonlybya little. Even atlowercosts, too fewnewnichesappeared to absorb the worklessungulates. Lower priceseventuallymade ituneconomical formanyownersto keep them.Horses, so to speak, leftthe labourforce, in some cases throughsale to meatorglue factories. Asthe numbersofworking horsesand mulesin Americafell from about21m in 1918 to only3m orsoin 1960, the decline wasmirrored in the overall horse population. The analogywith horsescan clearlybe taken too far. Yettheexperience isinstructive. Automation isreducinghuman wages;MessrsAcemogluand Restrepo reckon thatone additional indus-trial robotperthousand workersreduceswagesacrossthe econ-omyby0.5%. Real wage growth in manyrich economieshasbeendisappointingformuch ofthe pasttwo decades. Lowwages areenablingsome reallocation ofworkers. An overwhelmingshareofthe growth in employmentin rich economiesoverthe past fewdecadeshasbeen in services, nearlyhalfin low-paying ﬁeldslikeretailingand hospitality. Employmentin such areashas been ableto grow, in part, because ofan abundance ofcheap labour.Yetlowpayleadsto policiesthatcomplicate the labour-mar-ketadjustment.

Computersenteredhomesin the 1980s, then migrated ontolaps, into pocketsand around wrists. In thelaboratory, computation hasfound its wayonto molarsand into eyeballs.

Although devicesthatcan read andwrite data to and from the brain aseasily astheywould to and from a computerre-main ﬁrmlyin the realm ofimagination,thathasnotstopped neuroscientists(and,ofcourse, MrMusk) from indulginginsome speculation. Theodore BergeroftheUniversityofSouthern California, in LosAngeles, hasproposed thatbrain implantsmightbe used to store and retrieve memo-company, in 2013). MrJohnson put$100mofhisown moneyinto Kernel, stating that“unlockingourbrain isthe mostsigniﬁcantand consequential opportunityin his-tory.”In some ways, MrJohnson and MrMuskare merelythe newboysin whatisquite an old ﬁeld. The ﬁrstbrain implants,carried outin the 1970s, were prostheticvi-sual systems, though theydid notworkwell. Cochlearimplants, to restore hearing,have done much better. Hundredsofthou-sandsofpeople nowhave them—though,strictlyspeaking, theytalkto auditorynervesratherthan to the brain directly,which simpliﬁesthe task.

And one ofthe latestideas in theﬁeld isto read and interpretbrain activity,in orderto restore movementto the limbsofthe paralysed (see nextarticle). In one importantway, however, Kerneland Neuralinkare diﬀerentfrom previouseﬀorts.

In FebruaryMrMusksaid thathe thought“meaningful” inter-facesbetween the brain and computationwere ﬁve yearsaway.

DrBerger’sprosthesiswould be in-tended to help those whose brainscannotform long-term memoriesbecause theyare damaged. Butifthe idea worked, thereseemslittle reason whythose withoutdamage should notand would notwantsomethingsimilar. MrMuskhimself, moreambitiouslystill, imaginesan implant thatwould letthe wearertap directlyinto theinternet, and all ofthe computational pow-eravailable there.

Implantsoften gener-ate scarsaround themselves. And the sur-geryneeded to putthem in place carriesrisksofitsown.There may, though, be alternative ap-proaches. One such isbeingtested by agroup atFlorida International University,in Miami, led bySakhratKhizroev. Dr Khiz-roevand histeam use magnetoelectric par-ticlesso tinythattheycan interact with theelectricﬁeld generated byan individualnerve cell. The team injectthese particles,tensofbillionsata time, into a vein in arat’stail, then dragthem into the animal’sbrain usingmagnets. Each particle pro-ducesan electricﬁeld when stimulated byan external magneticﬁeld. Thismay, inprinciple, permita researcherto use such aparticle to inﬂuence the electrical states ofnearbynerve cells—and thus, in essence,reprogram them. Howthatwould be donein practice, though, isobscure.Anotherapproach, beingpioneered byJose Carmena ofthe UniversityofCalifor-nia, Berkeley, and hiscolleagues, uses de-vicesthe size ofa grain ofrice to convert ul-trasonicenergybeamed towardstheminto electricitythatcan stimulate nerve ormuscle cells. Ultrasound travelsthroughthe body, so can powerand control suchdeviceswithoutwires.

Theprocedure thatallowed MrKochevartoachieve the featisreported in the Lancetthisweek.BoluAjiboye and Bob Kirsch, biomedi-cal engineersatCase Western Reserve Uni-versity, in Cleveland, used functional mag-netic-resonance imagingto locate nervecellsresponsible forarm movementsin theleftmotorcortexofMrKochevar’sbrain.The technique highlighted a patch ofhisbrain to which the blood supplyincreasedwheneverMrKochevarimagined movinghisrightarm. The team then implanted atthatspottwo 4x4mm chips, known asUtah arrays, each armed with 96 tinyelec-trodes, to measure the electrical activity ofthe 100 orso nerve cellsthere. Theyalsoimplanted 36 stimulatingelectrodesin themusclesofhisrighthand and arm.With the Utah arraysin place, Mr Ko-chevarwasasked to imagine movinga vir-tual arm in a computersimulation, and,later, to imagine movinghisown armwhile itwasbeingmoved forhim. The pat-ternsofelectrical activityfrom the nervecellsﬁringin MrKochevar’sbrain were fedto a computeralgorithm, which matchedthem to the motionsofthe virtual arm andlater, hisown arm. Afterthistraining, thealgorithm wasable to detectbrain activityassociated with MrKochevar’sintention tomove hisarm and then triggerthe contrac-tion ofmusclesneeded to bringabout thedesired motion. Because MrKochevarhad lostthenervesrequired to move manyofhisshouldermuscles, hisarm movementswere assisted bya motorised platform,which he also controlled remotely.

MrKochevar’sparalysisismore severe, however, and the motionshe can perform with the aid ofFESaremore complex.Even so, there are hurdlesto clear be-fore FEScan be used routinely. The elec-trodesimplanted into the brain do not lastmore than a fewyears. More robustonesneed to be developed before FEScan be de-ployed widely. Several groupsare workingon that. Also, both the brain electrodes andthe electrodesto the arm and hand are con-nected to the outside world bycables.Wirelessconnectionswould be better.Such a set-up wasdemonstrated lastyearin monkeys.

Thesedays, carsand othermotorised vehicleskill around 250m birdsa year.

The conclusion ofthissyllogism isthatsmall-brained birdsare more likelyto be road-kill than large-brained birdsare.

Thesedetailsinclude the weightsofthe internalorgans, and likelycause ofdeath, of 3,521bird specimensof251species.Since theymet, DrMollerand MrErrit-zoe have collaborated on manypapers.Thistime, theyasked whetherthere was adiﬀerence between the weightsofthe or-gansofbirdskilled bytraﬃcand of thosethathad died ofothercauses.

Some 60% ofthe smallest-brained birdsMrErritzoe han-dled had died thisway.

MrJohnson haslongdelved intothe Chinese soul, winninga Pulitzerprizein 2001forhisreportingin the Wall StreetJournalon the party’ssuppression ofFalunGong, a spiritual movement. He comparesthe religiousrevival with the GreatAwak-eningsin America in the 18th and 19th cen-turies, when a stirringofpopularChristianbeliefled to majorsocial and politicalchange. He believesthe West, byfocusingon the politicsand economicsofChina, ismissingthe massive cultural shiftof hun-dredsofmillionsofChinese people turn-ingto religiousfaith foranswers.“Wethoughtwe were unhappybecause wewere poor,” saysone interviewee. “Butnowa lotofusaren’tpooranymore andyetwe’re still unhappy.” The bookpresentsa fascinatingpanora-ma: wealthyurbaniteson Daoistpilgrim-agesand youngChristian activistslearninghowto campaign againstforced abortion.MrJohnson issceptical aboutthe party’stop-down moralitycampaign. “Agovern-mentthatrelieson fearcannotinstil moral-ity; itcan onlyenforce behaviour,” hewrites. Much more important, he feels, isthe sense ofbottom-up empowermentthatfaith often provides. The state will con-tinue tryingto co-optreligiousgroups itbe-lievesare safe, and to crush the ones itper-ceivesasmore dangerous, which meansthattraditional religionssuch asBuddhismand Daoism are likelyto be the winners.

Given these hard-wired diﬀerences, itisonlynatural thatitcan sometimesseem thatmen are fromMarsand women from Venus. In “Testosterone Rex” Cordelia Fine ofthe UniversityofMelbourne takesaim atthose who suggestthatevolutionarily de-termined sexdiﬀerences—and the poweroftestosterone—can explain whymostCEOsare men and fewphysicistsare wom-en. She arguesthatessentialistpresump-tionsthatrationalise an unequal statusquo are “particularlyharmful to women”. Evolutionarydeterministssuggest thatfemalesare a resource thatmalesﬁghtover.

Femaleseitherchoose the winners,orthe winnerschoose them, dependingon the species. Buttell thisto the wildlypromiscuousfemale Savanna baboon orthe ﬁercelycompetitive female bush crick-et. MsFine usesstudiesofbehaviour fromacrossthe animal kingdom to argue thatneithersexhasa monopolyon competi-tiveness, promiscuity, choosinessorparen-tal care. Femaleswho sample widelytendto be more reproductivelysuccessful(which iswhya lionessmaymate up to 100timesa daywith diﬀerentlionsduring oes-trus), and those who jockeyfordominanceare often rewarded with more food. Amonghumans, the conventionalviewisthatmen are programmed to actlike Casanova. Afterall, a man can ejacu-late 100 timesin the time ittakesa womanto complete a menstrual cycle. ButMs Finearguesthatrelentlessmale promiscuityhaslimited beneﬁts. Because randomlytimed sexwill impregnate a healthywom-an onlyaround 3% ofthe time, she ﬁndsthata man would have to have sexwithmore than 130 women justto have a 90%chance ofbeatingthe fertilityrate of amonogamouscouple. This, she notes, maybe one ofthe reasonswhya majorityofmen—like women—saytheywould preferto be in a sexuallyexclusive relationship. MsFine doesnotdispute thatsexual se-lection hasshaped brainsand bodies, orthatgenesand hormonesinﬂuence howanimalsthinkand behave. An ever-chang-ing“mosaic” offeatures—some more com-mon in females, othersmore common inmales, some common in both—guidesboth men and women. But, she argues,people tend to overestimate these diﬀer-encesand underestimate the value ofenvi-ronmental factors, such asrearingcondi-tions, ecological resourcesand socialconditions: thatis, the nurture side ofthenature-nurture debate. She pointsto a re-centstudyofyoungChinese men andwomen playinga risk-takinggame, whichfound thatthe women were everybitasbold asthe men when theyplayed private-ly, buttheytookfewerrisks—and the mentookmore—when theirgameswere ob-served byan attractive memberofthe op-posite sex. MsFine suggeststhata desire toappeal to the observernudged the playersto heed gendernorms.Some neuroscientistsspeculate thatsexual traitsare vulnerable to environ-mental forcesto ensure thatanimalscanadaptto diﬀerenthabitats. Thisseems to beespeciallynecessaryforhumans, whomustlearn howto cope in groupsasdi-verse asmatrilineal Arcticforagersand pat-rilineal tropical horticulturalists. In herzeal to challenge evolutionarydeterminists, however, MsFine takesaswipe atsome strawmen. Fewserioustheoristsargue thatmale and femalebrainsare categoricallydiﬀerent, or thatin-dividualsare notinﬂuenced byenviron-mental pressures. Parentswho have bothboysand girlsmaycockan eyebrowat thewayshe largelyignoresstudiesofactualsexdiﬀerences, preferringto blame muchofgendered behaviouron socialisation. Asfortestosterone, onlythe mostreductiveobserverwould claim thatabsolute levelsofthe hormone “cause” behaviour, so it isnotsurprisingwhen MsFine explainsthatitseﬀectson brainsand bodiesismore nu-anced. She also oﬀersevidence thatseemsto undermine herpointthattestosteronedoesnotnecessarilymake men more riskyorcompetitive: apparentlythe testoster-one levelsofWall Streettradersgo up astheymake more money(a phenomenonknown asthe “winnereﬀect”), whichseemsto spurthem to take more risks.

Miningthe mythsofWaleswould becentral to hiswork. One ofhisgreatest re-gretswasthat, though he studied Welsh onand oﬀfordecades, he neverquite mas-tered it. HisWelshnesswas, ashisbio-grapher, ThomasDilworth, writes, “animaginative acquisition”.He wentto artschool atthe age of 13,havingalreadydrawn a magniﬁcentdanc-ingbearwhen he wasseven. In 1915, aged19, he joined the Royal Welsh Fusiliers andwassentto the Somme. He spent117 weeksatthe front, a terrible experience which,when ﬁnallyexpressed in wordsmorethan two decadeslater, would resultin “InParenthesis”, one ofthe greatestpoetic responsesto the ﬁrstworld war. Remem-beringthe conﬂictwould be a disease ofwhich he could neverrid himself.Jones’spaintingsand poetryappearedsuccessively, notsimultaneously. Whereashispoetrywasusuallydense and allusive,worked overagain and again (and thus ofgreatappeal to commentators), hispaint-ingscould be quicklymade. When com-plete, theywere diaphanousand airy, fullofwondrousand immediate beauty, espe-ciallywhen he painted ﬂowersata win-dow. There wasa lettinggo abouttheseworksand a marvellousnaivety. Jones’sreligion—he converted to Catholicism in1921, much to the horrorofhisparents—grounded and enriched him. Forthe paint-er-poetartwassacramental, a setting apartand a raisingup. Nothingpleased himmore than listeningto Gregorian chant onhisscratchygramophone.7David Jones, painter-poetModernistmanDavid Jones: Engraver, Soldier, Painter,Poet.By Thomas Dilworth.

Wheth-ertitlesofbooksshould be in italicsorin inverted commascan divide themmore decidedlythan the Sharksand theJets. So ata recentmeetingofthe Ameri-can CopyEditorsSociety, the “ChicagoManual ofStyle” and the Associated Press(AP) stylebook, both widelyfollowed, an-nounced a change thatsentwavesthrough the audience. In AP’swording,“They/them/theirisacceptable in limitedcasesasa singularand-orgender-neutralpronoun, when alternative wordingisoverlyawkward orclumsy.” English lacksan uncontroversial pro-noun thatletsyoutalkabouta person ofagenericorunknown gender—known asan “epicene” pronoun, from the Greekfor“common to all” (genders). Some wouldsaythat“each presidentchooseshisowncabinet” isepicene—butpsychological re-search provesthatthe hiscallsto mind aman. (Ifyoutrulybelieve hisisgender-neutral, try“Steve, Sally, Maryand Janeeach had hishaircuttoday.”)Otherlanguagesface the problem indiﬀerentguises. In French the possessivesson, sa and sesdo double dutyas“his”and “her”. Achacun son opinioncan beread as“Each hashisopinion” or“Eachhasheropinion.” ButFrench can’tavoidthe issue entirely: Chaque présidentchoisitson cabinet(“each presidentpickshiscabi-net”) usesa masculine noun forpresident,which the French traditionallyconsiderepicene, fora genericorunknown presi-dent. Butifthe presidentisa woman, thetitle becomesthe clearlyfeminine prési-dente. So “generic” titleslike présidentdosubtlyindicate a man.Nearlyalways, ifa language mustchoose one genderto be generic, it isthemasculine. Banawá, spoken in Brazil, isan exception, butitsspeakersalso happento treatwomen and girlsquite brutally, accordingto Dan Everett, a linguistwhohasstudied them. Grammarisnotdestiny.The AP and Chicago (and the forthcom-ingedition ofThe Economiststylebook)open the doorto a controversial—butsur-prisinglytraditional—solution to the pro-blem: “each presidentchoosestheirowncabinet”. Some people sayitisillogical:each presidentissingular, and theirisclear-lyplural. Eﬀortsto use theirinstead ofhisare modern political correctnessrunningroughshod overgrammatical good sense.Butthatiswrong. Theircan do double-dutyjustasyourcan forboth singularandplural. Youhasa partlyparallel history.First, itwasthe objectform ofyefora plu-ral: we-us, ye-you. Then itreplaced ye:we-us, you-you. Itwasthen used asa politewayto referto a single person, much likethe French vous. Then itstarted edging outthe common wayto referto a single per-son, thou. From second-person-plural pro-noun in the objective case to a singular inthe nominative isa prettybigshift. Press-ingthey/their/them into service fora ge-nericorunknown referentisactually lessofa leap. Supportersofthe epicene theyarguethatitishigh time thiswasaccepted, in aworld aware ofsexdiscrimination. Butthisisunlikelyto convince traditionalists.Abetterargumentisthatthe singular theyishardlya newfangled political inven-tion. The Oxford English Dictionary’sﬁrstcitation fora sex-neutral, indeﬁnitetheyisfrom about1375. (Singularyouasa subjectdatesbackonlyto 1405.)

TheAmerican DialectSocietycrowned singu-lartheyitsword ofthe yearfor2015.The alternativesare worse. He orshequicklybecomeswearisome on repeti-tion. Alternatinghe and she isdistracting.Inventingpronounsdoesnothelp: fromhersh to ze, made-up gender-neutral pro-nounshave nevertaken oﬀand probablyneverwill. One alternative would be to make thereferentplural: “Presidentschoose theirown cabinets.” Thisisusuallythe bestthingto do. Butthere are timeswhen awriterwantsto conjure an individual, al-beita genericone. In such cases, the trulynewfangled optionshave failed to gainwidespread acceptance amongeditorsand writersofquality. Singular, epicenetheyhasnotjustmodern genderequalitybutseven centuriesofthe ﬁnestliterarytradition on itsside. Asusage disputes go,thisshould be an easyone.Everybodyhas theiropinionJohnsonEnglish lacks an uncontroversial gender-neutral pronoun, butitdoes have a traditional solutionplagued bymoneytroublesand ill healththroughouttheirlives; and fewenjoyedsatisfactorypersonal relationships. Musicologistsgenerallyagree about thebrighteststarsofthe classical repertoire,and here theyall are, above all Bach, Beet-hoven, Handel, Mozartand a raftofRo-mantics, from Schubertto Wagner. MrSwaﬀord also thinksa lotofHaydn and,beingAmerican himself, givespromi-nence to a numberofAmerican compos-ers. When itcomesto the 20th and 21stcen-turies, the namesproliferate and judgmentbecomesmore diﬃcult, partlybecause“historyhasonlybegun to do itsjob of de-cidingwho thrivesand who fades”; andpartly, he says, because media, and partic-ularlyonline media, have given music anewkind ofimmortality.Between the storiesofthe composers,MrSwaﬀord slipsin manyinteresting di-gressions. One isan excellentexplanationofthe diﬀerence between tonal music,based on scalesand keys, and the atonalsort, which dispenseswith such conven-tions. Anotherisan evaluation ofthe early-musicmovement(usinghistorical instru-mentsand performance) that“reallycameofage in the 1970s.” Athird isaboutthe complicated art andscience ofpiano tuning. The interval be-tween each note isdetermined bya mathe-matical ratio, and the 12 notesin an octavegetyouto a higherorlowerversion of thenote youstarted on. Butifyouobserve exactlythe rightdistance between eachnote, youend up, forreasonsthatare stillnotclear, with an octave thatsounds slight-lyoutoftune, so the discrepancyhas to be redistributed amongall 12 notes. This“tem-pering” can be done in a varietyofways. All the while, MrSwaﬀord entertains ashe informs. Butin the end, musicto him isathingunto itself, “a language ofthe spirit—itsessence can’tbe captured in words.” 775The Economist April1st2017The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) intends to contract the consultancy service for conducting Diagnostic Studies on commercial banks.

He wasa bentastronomer, tracingoutthe circle of time inthe singeingstarsabove the mango trees;the careful stencillerofa ﬂowered windowframe, orthe planerofa canoe; an egretstalkingthe reeds, hispen’sbeak“pluckingup wrigglinginsects/like nounsand gul-pingthem”. Above all, though, he wasa poet-mari-ner, a rusty-head sailorwith sea-greeneyes, “a red niggerwho love the sea”, aslo-calssaid: red because he had Dutch, Eng-lish and blackin him, the inevitable min-glingofvoyagersto the Caribbean. Allroadsled to the sea, itwasalwaysvisible;the roarofthe surfwasin hisbody, and itsrhythm in the lineshe wrote. Each dawn,aftercigarette and coﬀee, he wascalled tohisblue portable typewriter“like a ﬁsher-man walkingtowardsthe white noise/ofpaper, then in itshollowcraftsetshis oars.”Hispen became a sea-dippingswiftcross-ingand recrossingthe waters, like memory,ora crab, “obliquityburrowingto surface”.Inevitablythe hero ofhisgreatestpoem,“Omeros”, wasa simple ﬁsherman, Ach-ille, who in a consciousechoingofHomersethispirogue on the ocean and simplysailed away. Hisstorywaswritten in terzarima, ﬂexible and ever-ﬂowing.The sea washistory: beneath itwere thewrecked shipsthathad foughtforthe is-lands, British, Dutch and French, with theirdrowned sailorsand drowned slaves, thewomen nowmanacled with cowrie shells.Itﬂoated Achille to Africa and Africa to theWest, each prisonercarryingitsrhythmsbutnotitslanguage to the otherworld, and whatbegan dissolvingwasthe fadingsound oftheirtribal name forthe rain,the brightsound forthe sun, a hissing nounforthe river, and alwaysthe word “never”, and nevertheword “again”.YetMrWalcottdid notbelieve slaveryshould be dwelton, like a chaﬁngsore. Heraged atit, butthe sea erased everything,and the surf’slineswere ici pasni un rien:whathasbeen done isnothing, startagain. Hispersonal life knewthe same ﬂux:three wives, all treated badly, to his latergrief; manyliaisons. Hislovestoo were ex-pressed in sea-language: postcoitum “theeightlimbsloosen, like tentaclesin water”;in the morninghe would lie watching“thefall and rise/ofsuspiringlinen, like a skiﬀatanchor”. He would cup a breastashefondled a white stone from the beach.These propensities, noted when he wasteachingin America in the 1980sand 1990s,costhim the chance to be, in 1999, Britain’spoetlaureate and, ten yearslater, professorofpoetryatOxford. He wasnotconcerned,forhe did notwantto drop hisanchor longon anynorthern shore. The horned islandThe one pointofﬁxityin hislife was hishome island ofStLucia, where the indigohornsofthe Pitonsrose to the sky, wherethe copperysea-almondsshookin thewind and claypathswound, throughgreen bananas, to the villagesofrusted gal-vanise; where all wasbrightand present-tense, all the time. StLucia wasthe beauti-ful Helen the colonisershad foughtover,reimagined asa blackhousemaid strollingthe beach in a yellowdress, swinging aplasticsandal; who “dinttake no shit/fromwhite people”, and whose waistswayedlike palmsin the weather.There he had ﬁrstfound the “foreignmachinery” ofEnglish literature: Dickensand Scotton the shelvesathome, “TheWorld’sClassics” in the barber’sshop, Kip-ling, Shakespeare and Milton atschool,and imagined hisown shadowfallingonthose distant, cobbled streets. There he be-gan to write seriouslyat11, a poem a dayinan exercise book, and at19 published hisﬁrstcollection, paid forbyhismother.He wasmadlyin love with Englishthen, and knewthathiscallingwasto be agreatEnglish poet. AgreatEnglish play-wright, too, perhaps; he wrote 80 orsoplays, and setup theatre workshopsinboth Trinidad, hisbase for20 years, andBoston. ALondon house, Cape, publishedhisﬁrstbookoutside the WestIndies in1962. Buthe found an inevitable cleavagebetween these worlds: thatin both hus-tlingAmerica and drizzling, hedge-boundEngland, with theirstrange snowsand dis-orientatingcities, he would alwaysbe anexile, patronised as“a Commonwealthwriter” or, bysome blacks, asa craven ad-mirerofthe Western canon. He strove notto forgethisnative patoisofthe babblingcedars, ground-dovesand sea, orthe aston-ishmentofcolourand light: a lightthatmade him a painter, like hisfather, as wellasa writer, and led him to considerthepoet’scraftasa celebration and a prayer. He had travelled often and far, but con-cluded thatpoetrywasbestdone within aperimeterofabout20 miles. The truest,simplest, potentiallythe greatest, lay closeto home: in the red ﬂaresofthe ﬂame tree,the “leopardinglight” ofthe forests, thegossip ofcafé and rumshop, the thick-leaved breadfruityards. And, mostof all, inthe ocean. Withoutit, he pushed hispen“through a thicknothing”; with it, he had ashiningshield, a theatre, a light-sparklinghoard, a music, an untiringlover. The lastline of“Omeros” washisown: “When heleftthe beach the sea wasstill going on.” 7Songs ofthe seaDerekWalcott, poetofthe Caribbean, died on March 17th, aged 87ObituaryDerek WalcottPostgraduate Diploma in
