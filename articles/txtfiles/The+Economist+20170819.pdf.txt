From the start, these argumentslooked like wishful thinking. AfterMrTrump’spressconfer-ence in NewYorkon August15th theylie in ruins. The unscripted remarkswere histhird attemptto deal withviolentclashesin Charlottesville, Virginia, overthe weekend(see page 28). In them the presidentstepped backfrom Mon-day’s—scripted—condemnation ofthe white supremacistswho had marched to protestagainstthe removal ofa statue ofRobertE. Lee, a Confederate general, and foughtwith counter-demonstrators, includingsome from the left. In NewYork, ashisnewchiefofstaﬀlooked on dejected, MrTrump let rip,stressingonce again thatthere wasblame “on both sides”. Heleftno doubtwhich ofthose sidesliescloserto his heart.MrTrump isnota white supremacist. He repeated his criti-cism ofneo-Nazisand spoke outagainstthe murderof HeatherHeyer(see ourObituary). Even so, hisunsteadyresponse con-tainsa terrible message forAmericans. Farfrom being the sav-iourofthe Republic, theirpresidentispoliticallyinept, morallybarren and temperamentallyunﬁtforoﬃce.Self-harmStartwith the ineptness. In lastyear’spresidential election MrTrump campaigned againstthe political classto devastating ef-fect. Yetthisweekhe hasbungled the simplestofpolitical tests:ﬁndinga wayto condemn Nazis. Havingequivocated at hisﬁrstpressconference on Saturday, MrTrump said what wasneeded on Mondayand then undid all hisgood workon Tues-day—brieﬂyunitingFoxNewsand MotherJonesin their criti-cism, surelya ﬁrst. Asbusinessleadersstarted to resign enmasse from hisadvisorypanels, the White House disbandedthem. MrTrump did, however, earn the endorsementofDavidDuke, a formerImperial Wizard ofthe KuKluxKlan. The extreme rightwill stage more protestsacrossAmerica.MrTrump hascomplicated the taskofcontainingtheirmarchesand keepingthe peace. The harm will spill over intothe restofhisagenda, too. Hislatestpressconference wassup-posed to be abouthisplansto improve America’sinfrastruc-ture, which will require the supportofDemocrats. He need-lesslysetbackthose eﬀorts, ashe hasso often in the past.“Infrastructure week” in June wasdrowned outbyan investi-gation into Russian meddlingin the election—an investigationMrTrump helped bringaboutbyﬁringthe directorof the FBIinaﬁtofpique. Likewise, repealingObamacare collapsed partlybecause he lacked the knowledge and charisma to win over re-bel Republicans. He reacted to thatsetbackbybelittling theleaderofthe Senate Republicans, whose help he needs to passlegislation. So much forgettingthingsdone.MrTrump’sineptpoliticsstem from a moral failure. Somecounter-demonstratorswere indeed violent, and MrTrumpcould have included harsh wordsagainstthem somewhere inhisremarks. Butto equate the protestand the counter-protestrevealshisshallowness. Video footage showsmarchers carry-ingfascistbanners, wavingtorches, brandishingsticks andshields, chanting“Jewswill notreplace us”. Footage ofthecounter-demonstration mostlyshowsaverage citizensshout-ingdown theiropponents. And theywere rightto do so: whitesupremacistsand neo-Nazisyearn fora societybased on race,which America foughta world warto prevent. MrTrump’sseeminglyheartfeltdefence ofthose marchingto defend Con-federate statuesspoke to the degree to which white grievanceand angry, sournostalgia ispartofhisworld view.Atthe rootofitall isMrTrump’stemperament. In diﬃculttimesa presidenthasa dutyto unite the nation. MrTrumptried in Monday’spressconference, butcould notsustain theeﬀortforeven 24 hoursbecause he cannotgetbeyond himself.Apresidentneedsto rise above the point-scoringand to actinthe national interest. MrTrump cannotsee beyond the latestslight. Instead ofgraspingthathisjob isto honour the oﬃce heinherited, MrTrump isbothered onlyabouthonouringhim-selfand takingcreditforhissupposed achievements. Presidentshave come in manyformsand still commandedthe oﬃce. Ronald Reagan had a moral compassand the self-knowledge to delegate political tactics. LBJ wasa diﬃcult manbuthad the skill to accomplish much thatwasgood. Mr Trumphasneitherskill norself-knowledge, and thisweekshowedthathe doesnothave the characterto change.Thisisa dangerousmoment. America iscleftin two. Afterthreateningnuclearwarwith North Korea, musingabout in-vadingVenezuela and equivocatingoverCharlottesville, MrTrump still hasthe supportoffour-ﬁfthsofRepublican voters.Such popularitymakesitall the harderforthe country to unite.Thisleadsto the question ofhowRepublicansin public lifeshould treatMrTrump. Those in the administration face a hardchoice. Some will feel tempted to resign. Buthisadvisers, par-ticularlythe three generalssittingatthe top ofthe Pentagon,the National SecurityCouncil and asMrTrump’schiefofstaﬀ,are betterplaced than anyone to curb the worstinstincts oftheircommander-in-chief. An Oval Oﬃce-shaped holeForRepublicansin Congressthe choice should be clearer.Manyheld theirnosesand backed MrTrump because theythoughthe would advance theiragenda. Thatdeal hasnotpaid oﬀ. MrTrump isnota Republican, butthe solo star ofhisown drama. Bytyingtheirfate to his, theyare harming theircountryand theirparty. Hisboorish attemptsatplain speakingserve onlyto poison national life. Anygainsfrom economic re-form—and the boomingstockmarketand lowunemploymentowe more to the global economy, tech ﬁrmsand dollar weak-nessthan to him—will come atan unacceptable price. Republicanscan curb MrTrump iftheychoose to. Ratherthan indulginghisoutragesin the hope thatsomething goodwill come ofit, theymustcondemn them. The bestofthem didso thisweek. Othersshould follow. 7UnﬁtThis weekhas shown thatDonald Trump has no grasp ofwhatitmeans to be presidentLeaders8LeadersThe EconomistAugust19th20171FORmonths, asthe clockhasticked towardsa two-yeardeadline forBritain to leave theEuropean Union in March 2019,Theresa May’sgovernmenthasbeen criticised forbeingill-pre-pared, divided and unrealistic initsapproach to Brexit. And right-lyso. However, thisweekittooka belated step towards realityin the ﬁrsttwo ofa seriesofBrexitpapers, on future customsar-rangementsand on Northern Ireland. Itaccepted explicitly, forthe ﬁrsttime, thata temporarytransition, orinterim period,will be necessaryto averta damagingcliﬀ-edge exit in March2019, and thatin thisinterim period Britain should be in a cus-tomsunion with the EU. Thatisa bigstep forward. Itisall the more surprising, be-cause itcame justdaysafterPhilip Hammond, the chancellor,and Liam Fox, the trade secretary, promised in a newspaper ar-ticle that, even in an interim period, Britain would be outoftheEU’ssingle marketand customsunion. The oﬃcial Brexit pa-peracknowledgesthatthismayhappen eventually, and oﬀersideasfora newcustomsregime that, although burdensomeand quite possiblyimpractical, atleasttriesto minimise thecoststo traders(see page 44). Butin the meantime the paperproposesan interim temporarycustomsunion thatwill betantamountto stayingin the currentone. DrFoxinsists that, asisnotthe case today, he will be able to negotiate free-tradedealswith third countrieswhile Britain isin thisinterim cus-tomsunion. He iswrong. No trade deal can take eﬀect so longasBritain isin a customsunion. And no countrywill be willingto negotiate the detailsofanydeal until Britain’sown futuretrade arrangementswith the EUare clear.Atransitional period with a temporarycustomsunion willputoﬀthe problem ofhowto keep the borderbetween North-ern Ireland and the Republicasfrictionlessaspossible. Butonce Britain leavesthe customsunion, bordercontrols in someform will surelybe necessary. Thiswill damage the island’seconomyand destabilise itspolitics; the Irish government isrightlyunhappy. Although the British government’spaperper-sistsin the vain search fora technological solution thatcanmagicallyavoid anyborderatall, itdoesatleastacknowledgethatBrexitwill involve signiﬁcantadministrative costs forbothpartsofthe island.Those trade-oﬀsThe governmentnowneedsto build on thisnew, more soberapproach. Detail and realism should be the hallmarksof thebigBrexitspeech thatMrsMayplansto give nextmonth. Onepartofthismustbe to concede thatBritain isbound to face asubstantial exitbill, forwithoutthisthe EUwill notbe pre-pared even to talkabouttrade. And when itcomesto thesetalks, MrsMaymustbe more open aboutthe compromisestheyinvolve. Putcrudely, the more control Britain takes backfrom Brussels, the biggerwill be the hitto itstrade and thustoBritons’ livingstandards.MrsMayalso needsto acceptthatothercountriesalso havepolitics. Too much ofthe Brexitdebate in London has been in-ternallyfocused: resolvingcabinetdisputes, tryingto keep Par-liamentonside, workingoutwhatthe Labouropposition real-lywants. In the end, however, the trickiestnegotiations will bewith the EU27. Securingthe necessarymajorityin Brussels foran exitdeal will be hard enough. Butwhen itcomesto transi-tion or, even more crucially, to the ultimate trade arrange-ments, the othercountriesmustagree unanimouslyand theirparliamentsmustratifythe deal. Thatwill take time, probablyyears, and itwill need defterdiplomacythan MrsMay’sgov-ernmenthasdisplayed so far. Thisweek’spapersare buta ﬁrststep towardsa more realisticapproach to Brexit.7Britain and the European UnionRealitystarts to dawnThe British governmentis slowlymoving towards accepting harsh truths aboutBrexitEVERsince the ﬁnancial crisis,the world hasbeen plaguedbyweakproductivitygrowth.One explanation isthatin un-certain timesﬁrmsare keener totake more people on to the pay-roll than to investheavily innewequipment. The construc-tion industryhasbeen aﬄicted bysuch problemsfor decades.Since 1995 the global average value-added perhourhasgrownataround a quarterofthe rate in manufacturing. According toMcKinsey, a consultancy, no industryhasdone worse. Thingsare especiallydismal in rich countries. In France andItalyproductivityperhourhasfallen byabouta sixth. Ger-manyand Japan have seen almostno growth. America is evenworse: there, productivityin construction hasplunged byhalfsince the late 1960s. Thisisno triﬂingmatter. The building tradeisworth $10trn each year, or13% ofworld output. Ifitsproduc-tivitygrowth had matched thatofmanufacturingin the past20 years, the world would be $1.6trn betteroﬀeach year.One source ofthe industry’sproductivityproblem lies in itsfragmented structure. In America lessthan 5% ofbuildersworkforconstruction ﬁrmsthatemployover10,000 workers,compared with 23% in businessservicesand 25% in manufac-turing. Itsproﬁtmarginsare the lowestofanyindustry exceptforretailing. Itisalso highlycyclical.

Itneed notbeThe EconomistAugust19th2017 Leaders912downturnsthataﬄictthe industry, anyﬁrm thatinvests in cap-ital, and therebyraisesitsﬁxed costs, isvulnerable. Bycontrast,companiesthatemploylotsofworkerswithoutinvestingmuch can simplycuttheirworkforces. Afewbuildingﬁrms areexperimentingwith newtechniques, from 3Dprintinganddronesto laser-scanningand remote-controlled cranes (seepage 49). Butthe trade asa whole isreluctantto spend moneyon the sortsoftechnologies, from project-management soft-ware to massproduction, thathave revolutionised so manyotherindustries. The clientsofconstruction ﬁrmshave everyinterest in low-erbillsand speediercompletions. Butprivate-sector custom-ersare themselvestoo fragmented to catalyse change. Govern-mentsare anotherstory. The publicsectoraccountsfor 20-30%oftotal construction spendingin America and Europe. Asbothalarge customerand a setterofstandards, ithasthe cloutandthe meansto encourage the industryto improve.First, governmentscan mitigate the industry’sboom-and-bustproblem bysmoothingouttheirspendingon construc-tion projects. Too often publicinvestmentiscutduring down-turnsto ﬁnd budgetarysavings. Greatercertaintyabout futureworkwill give ﬁrmsconﬁdence to investmore in technology.Providinggreaterclarityaboutproposed projectscan alsohelp. Britain’sNational Infrastructure Pipeline, an assessmentofplanned spendingbyboth the publicand private sector, hasboosted investmentin the tunnellingbusinessbecause com-paniescan see more clearlywhatprojectslie ahead. Second, governmentscan encourage the spread ofmassproduction byharmonisingbuildingcodes. The growth ofcompaniesmakingprefabricated housescan be stymied bythe costofadaptingtheirdesignsforspeciﬁcjurisdictions. Thisistrue notjustacrossbordersbutwithin them. Americancountiesand municipalitiesemployup to 93,000 diﬀerentbuildingcodesbetween them. Standardisingrulesought tomean biggerproduction runsand higherreturns. Can theyﬁxit?Public-sectorcontractscan also be designed to nudge compa-niesto adoptnewtechnologiesand to co-ordinate with eachothermore eﬃciently. Too manyconstruction jobsare stillmapped outwith pen and paper. Britain, France and Singa-pore nowrequire biddersforpublic-sectorcontractsto use aprocesscalled “buildinginformation modelling”, a type ofdig-itised construction plan, in the hope thatonce theyhave in-vested in the relevantsoftware, itwill be used in private-sectorprojects, too. Buildingsitesare often home to manycontractorsand subcontractors. Structuringpublic-sectorcontracts so thatthese ﬁrmsshare in a bonusifprojectscome in on time and un-derbudgetisanotherexample ofgood practice. The world hasan annual $1trn shortfall in infrastructurespending. Those projectsthatare given the green light tend tocome in late and overbudget.

Sharesin a SteveJobs-lessApple could be pickedup forlittle more than a dollar;JeﬀBezoslefthisjob ata hedgefund to setup a newkind ofretailer, afterlearning ofthe fast-growinguse ofthe internet. Atthe startofthatyear the NorthAmerica Free-Trade Agreementcame into force. ItcommittedAmerica, Canada and Mexico to eliminate mostofthe tariﬀson goodsbetween them within a decade. NAFTAwascontroversial from the start. Itscritics havegrown louderovertime, despite itssuccessin boosting tradeand investment. Weeksbefore hiselection aspresident, Don-ald Trump called NAFTA“the worsttrade deal maybe ever”and said he would junkit. In April he relented: a realisationthatlotsofTrump-votingstatesrelyheavilyon trade with Mex-ico and Canada mayhave swayed him. Instead, on August16th, trade representativesofthe three signatoriesgathered inWashington, DC, to renegotiate the pact. Whatevertheirprovenance, such talksare an opportunity. Adeal agreed on inthe early1990sisill-ﬁtted fora much-changed economic land-scape. Indeed there isa real possibilitythatMrTrump, farfromkillingfree trade in North America, mightmake itfreer.Thatwill happen onlyifeach side concedeson itsbig stick-ing-points(see page 57). MrTrump’sdemand thatan upgradedNAFTAmustnarrowAmerica’strade deﬁcitswith Canada andMexico ispointless. Thisisnotonlybecause such a demandaskstoo much ofitspartners. America’soverall balance oftrade isultimatelydetermined byitsinvestmentand saving.Even iftinkeringwith NAFTAwere to reduce the bilateral def-icitswith Canada and Mexico, unlessAmerica savesmore, def-icitswith othercountrieswould increase.Yetthere are three bigareasin which there isa lot ofscope toimprove NAFTA to the beneﬁtofall itssignatories.

Thatwill require a streamliningofthe processby whichAmerica grantspermitsforcross-bordergridsand pipelines. Don’tcall itTPP-liteAthird wayin which NAFTA could be improved liesin howthe pactispoliced. All sidesgrumble aboutthe present set-up.America’smore recenttrade agreementswith, forinstance,South Korea and Colombia include bindingsafeguardsagainstthe use ofchild orforced labour. Such stricturescould be wiredinto a revised agreementin orderto addressconcerns aboutarace to the bottom in labourand environmental standards. Trade talkstend to founderon the details, which is whytheyoften take yearsto conclude. The negotiationsfor NAFTAmustbe completed in a fewmonths, before campaigning startsforMexico’spresidential election in 2018. Yeta deal isstill pos-sible. RobertLighthizer, America’strade representative, mightbe inclined to settle NAFTA, ifonlyto geton with picking a ﬁghtwith China overitslaxobservance ofintellectual-propertyrights(see page 58). In addition, partsofa newpactcan be cutand pasted fromthe Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership (TPP), a 12-countrytrade pactthatMrTrump declined to ratify.

Butuntil lastmonth fewwould have pointedto Section 44 asthe cause ofapolitical furore. Itstatesthatmembersofthe federal parlia-mentmustnotbe “underanyacknowledgmentofallegiance,obedience oradherence to a foreign power”. More speciﬁcally,theymustnotbe a “subjectorcitizen” ofa foreign country.Thatseemsclearenough, yetso farhalfa dozen membersofparliamenthave been found to have broken the rule. Twosenatorsresigned in July, havingdiscovered thatthey were stillcitizensofcountriesfrom which theyhad emigrated as infants.The mostrecentMPto be rumbled, BarnabyJoyce, the tub-thumpinglypatrioticdeputyprime minister, isconsidered acitizen byNewZealand, since hisfatherwasborn there. Thefate ofthe governmentmayhangon whetherhe isforced to re-sign (see page 21). Tryingto make sure thatlawmakersdo notowe allegianceto a foreign powerisfairenough. Butthe accidentof birth andpossession ofparticularcitizenship papersare poormeasuresofloyalty, all the more so in a time ofglobal travel, migrationand mixed marriages. People ofmore than one nationalityshould notbe treated with suspicion. Aslongasthey paytheirtaxes, theyshould be celebrated. ItisnotjustAustralia thathasarchaicrulesofeligibility forparliament, although itisfeelingthe problem more acutely be-cause ithasbecome vastlymore cosmopolitan than itwaswhen itsconstitution wasdrafted in the 1890s. Fully26% ofAustralianswere born abroad. An even biggerpercentagewould be eligible for(and mayindeed hold) citizenship ofsome othercountrybydescent, like MrJoyce. Egypt, Israel and Sri Lanka, amongothers, do notallowdual citizensto be MPs. Three ofthe fourmostpopulouscoun-triesin the world—China, India and Indonesia—do notallowdual citizenship atall. Japan and Germanyseverelyrestrict it.In America onlya “natural born citizen” can become presi-dent—a rule thatdogged a previouspresident, BarackObama,duringthe absurd “birther” controversy. Myanmarbarspeoplewho have married foreignersfrom the presidency, which iswhyAungSan SuuKyi, daughterofthe country’sindepen-dence hero, AungSan, cannothold the job; instead, she hasin-vented the postof“state counsellor” to run the country. Mex-ican lawbarsnotonlyimmigrantsfrom the presidency, butalso theirchildren in certain circumstances. Naturalised Mex-icans, who mustrenounce anyotherpassports, are not al-lowed to serve in the police, ﬂya plane orcaptain a ship.These rulesare derived from crude notionsofidentitybased on blood and soil. Theymighthave appealed in times offrequentinter-state warsand massconscription. They makeno sense in thisage ofvolunteerarmiesand globalisation. There isno reason to suppose thatdual nationalsare anymore inclined to treacherythan anyone else. Manyexamplespointto the contrary. The onlyAustralian MPto have been ac-cused ofdoinganothercountry’sbiddingin recentyearsisSam Dastyari, a senatorwho made statementssympathetic toChina aftertakingmoneyfrom companieswith tiesto the Chi-nese government. He isnotofChinese origin. Money, ideologyorblackmail are more likelyto procure “al-legiance, obedience and adherence” than a passport. Think ofBenedictArnold, an American general in the warofindepen-dence who asked for£20,000 to defectto the British side; orofthe “Cambridge Five”, upper-crustBritonswho spied for theSovietUnion. And rememberthatthe Battle ofBritain againstNazi Germanywaswon with the sacriﬁce of, amongothers,manyPolish and otherforeign pilots.In praise ofmongrelsThese daysmostpeople’scontribution to theirhome countriesisthrough theirwork, talent, ingenuityand investment. Closerrelationsbetween countriesare a good thing, diminishing thechancesofconﬂictand increasingprosperitythrough trade.Who betterto knitthose tiesthan those ofmixed nationality?Ifvotersare worried thatpoliticianswith two ormore pass-portsmightnotbe actingin theirbestinterests, they can al-waysvote them out. Buttheyshould also be given the choiceto vote such people in. 7Dual citizenshipDouble happiness People with two nationalities should be feted, notmistrustedTHE MATCHMAKING SERVICEGlobal Headquarters: 49 Charles Street  Mayfair  London  W1J 5EN  +44 (0)20 7290 9585  WORLDWIDE www.grayandfarrar.comYOUR BEST DECISION TO DATE12The EconomistAugust19th2017Letters are welcome and should beaddressed to the Editor at The Economist, The Adelphi Building,1-11John Adam Street, London WC2N 6HTE-mail: letters@economist.comMore letters are available at:Economist.com/lettersCharacteristics ofpopulismThe Free exchange column ofJuly22nd tried to lookforcommon factorsbehind therise ofpopulism in Americaand Europe.

Behind you, arrayed alonga rib-bonlike trackabout100km wide stretchingall the wayto the Atlantic, millions willawaittheirown momentofwitness.Astotal eclipsesgo, thatofAugust 21st—the ﬁrstto be visible from the continentalUnited Statessince 1979—will be a shortone. Even those standingatthe mostfa-voured spot, which isin southern Illinois,will enjoyjust160 secondsoftotality,abouta third ofthe maximum possible. Alittle underthree minutesofdarkness maynotsound such a bigdeal. Butmanywhohave experienced a totalitywill tell youthatitisthe mostawe-inspiringsight youwill eversee in yourlife.In the past, thisawe wasoften manifest-ed asterror. Twenty-sixcenturiesago thehostsofLydia and Media were busybutch-eringeach otherin whatisnowTurkeywhen an eclipse darkened the sky. Both ar-miesthrewdown theirweaponsandcalled the whole thingoﬀ. Ancientculturesblamed wolves, dogsordragonsfortryingto eatthe sun. People would bangpots andpanstogether, orﬁre arrowsatthe darken-ingorb, tryingto scare the oﬀending beastsaway. Eclipseswere omensusually, auspic-esoccasionally, butalwayssignsofgreatimport. In 1133 an eclipse marked KingHen-ryI ofEngland’sdeparture forFrance; hewasto die there two yearslater, havingneverreturned to hiskingdom. The logicalconclusion, atleastforWilliam ofMalmes-bury, a historian ofthe time, wasthat “theelementsthemselvesmanifested theirsor-rowatthisgreatman’slastdeparture.”Thismonth’seclipse, though, will most-lybe an excuse fora partyand a bit ofama-teurastronomy. Around 12m people live di-rectlyin itspath. Millionsmore areexpected to travel there. Where ancientsworried aboutpoorharvestsorthe deathofthe sun god, modernswill worryaboutcar-parkingspacesand whetheranycheaphotel roomsare left.Scientistswill be interested, too, thoughnotasmuch asonce theywere. In 1919 ob-servationsofan eclipseshookthe world ofphysics. AlbertEinstein’sthen-newtheoryofgeneral relativitydescribed howgravitycould bend light, and thushowthe posi-tionsofstarswould seem to shiftwhentheywere close to the sun in the sky. In nor-mal circumstances, observingstarsclose tothe sun isimpossible. Butthe darkness ofthe eclipse letthe astronomerscheck theapparentpositionsofstarsnearthe sunagainstmeasurementstheyhad made atnight, a fewmonthsearlier. On examina-tion, the starswere held to have moved asEinstein had said theyshould.Modern eclipses, sadly, do notoﬀersuch paradigm-shiftingpossibilities.

Everynowand thenIfeclipseshave become the epitome ofpredictability, though, theystill revealsomethingaboutthe capriciousnessof theuniverse. The veryfactthatitispossible tosee a total eclipse atall isa happy accidentoftime and space. Itisan accidentofspace because thedistancesfrom the Earth to the sun andmoon are such that, seen from Earth, thelittle, nearbymoon and the vast, distantsun lookaswide asone another. The for-mercan thusjustcoverthe latter. This cor-respondence isnotalwaysexact. When themoon isatitsfarthestfrom Earth (its orbit isnotcircular) itdoesnottake up quiteenough ofthe skyto obscure all the solardisk. The resultisan annulareclipse, inwhich a thin ringofthe sun’ssurface sur-roundsthe blacknesscreated bythe moon.Itisan accidentoftime because themoon hasslowlybeen recedingfrom Eartheversince itscreation 4.5bn yearsago.

Millionsofyearshence, when ithasreceded fartherstill, itwill nevercome close enough to create atotal eclipse, and anyinhabitantsEarththen haswill have to make do with annu-larones. Human beingsare luckyenoughto live in the sweetspotin between.In a furtherstroke ofgood fortune, na-ture hasconspired to make eclipsesrareenough to be noteworthybutcommonenough thata motivated individual cansee plentyin a lifetime. Ifthe moon’sorbitaround Earth were circular, and in thesame plane asEarth’saround the sun, theneclipseswould be monthlyevents. In fact,the lunarorbitiselliptical and tilted. Theresultisthat, on average, two total eclipsesare seen from Earth everythree years. Eachis, however, visible from onlya tiny frac-tion ofthe planet’ssurface—itsown equiv-alentofthe narrowribbon laid acrossAmerica thismonth. Ata random point onEarth’ssurface youcan expectto hangaboutformore than 300 yearsbefore see-inga total eclipse. Thismixofexoticism, predictabilityand rarityleadssome people to devotetheirlivesto seeingasmanyeclipses aspossible. Francisco Diego, ofUniversityCollege, London, isone oftheirnumber.He hasobserved 20 in histime, he says, inlocationsasfarapartasEasterIsland, oneCrowning gloryofthe mostisolated inhabited places onEarth, and the south coastofCornwall,which ismerelythe mostisolated place inEngland.

Abigpartofthe appeal, saysDr Diego,isthe sheerdrama ofthe eventitself. “Bythe time the sun isaround 70-80% ob-scured, youstartto notice it’sgettingdark.”Justbefore totality, “the lightlevel reallyplummets.

Hourslater, with theshadowslongpassed and daylightre-stored, theywere still going, presumably inastate ofsome confusion. The momentoftotality, according to DrDiego, isitsown phenomenon, similar tonight-time butdiﬀerent, with the land-scape bathed in the corona’sfaintlight.These days, when even professional as-tronomers—who mostlybooktime on dis-tanttelescopesfrom the comfortoftheirair-conditioned oﬃces—can go formonthswithoutactuallyhavingto lookatthe nightsky, such a displayisa welcome reminderofthe cosmicspectacleswhich lie behindthe equationson the whiteboard. Non-scientistscan beneﬁtfrom thissense ofperspective, too. NASAhascalcu-lated the time, date, location and maxi-mum duration ofeveryeclipse between1999BCand 3000AD. The resultsare avail-able to all on itswebsite. Whateverhu-mansgetup to, the celestial clockwork willtickon with supreme indiﬀerence. Thatmaysound a depressingthought. Butit canalso be a reassuringone. AsGeorge Orwellputit, in a diﬀerentage: “The atom bombsare pilingup in the factories, the police areprowlingthrough the cities, the lies arestreamingfrom the loudspeakers, buttheEarth isstill goinground the sun, and nei-therthe dictatorsnorthe bureaucrats,deeplyastheydisapprove ofthe process,are able to preventit.” 7WHILE millionsacrossAmerica turntheircarefullyshielded eyesto theskieson August21st, those in the energybusinesswill be lookingatdata displays. Itwill be the ﬁrsteclipse to testthe country’selectricitygrid in the age ofsolarenergy. Asthe eclipse tracksacrossthe country1,900 solarfarmsable to generate upwardsof20 gigawatts(GW) ofpowerwill be putinto the shade. Thatrepresentsalmost halfofAmerica’s43GWofsolarcapacity. Reas-suringly, grid operatorsbelieve there areenough spare gas-ﬁred powerplantstoavoid blackouts. Butthe eclipse will revealalotaboutthe changingwaysAmericansboth produce and consume electricity.Forinstance, California mightseem inthe clear; the path oftotalitystays well tothe north and eastofit. Butitwill still bepartiallyeclipsed—atthe heightoftheeclipse the sun will be dimmed by62% onthe Mexican border—and because itissuchalarge producerofsolarpower, that mat-ters. California has18.9 gigawatts(GW)ofsolarcapacity; the state with the secondhighestcapacity, North Carolina, has3.3GW.At10.20, when the eclipse castsCalifor-nia into itsdeepestshadow, the state’sso-lar-powerproduction will dip byabout5.6GWbefore rampingup again asthe sunre-emerges(see chart). John Moura of theNorth American ElectricReliabilityCorp(NERC), a regulatorybody, underlines themagnitude ofthe challenge. When NERCteststhe resilience ofthe system, it imagi-nesknockingouttwo ofthe three nuclearreactorsatthe 3.8GWPalo Verde plantinArizona. Ifthe skiesare cloud-free, thiseclipse could have twice asmuch impact—albeittemporarilyand predictably. The system operatorshave taken les-sonsfrom Europe, which handled a three-houreclipse deftlyin March 2015, with90GWofsolarto deal with. Theywill passlessonson to theirsuccessorsin their turn.The eclipse due in 2024 will hita countrywith perhapsthree timesmore solarca-pacity. “Ifwe’re notreadyforthis, I have noconﬁdence in oursystem,” MrMoura says.Some unknownswill also be tested.Windschange duringeclipses, butthe ef-fectthatthiswill have on wind farms isnotyetclear. Demand forgrid-based electricitywill increase asdomesticsolarpanels feelthe shade, and measuringthatuptickwillreveal howmuch residential solarisin use.Butsome increased demand maybe for-gone. Michael Picker, presidentofthe Cali-fornia PublicUtilitiesCommission, hasurged Californiansto do their“thingforthesun” byswitchingoﬀappliancesduringthe eclipse.

Earlier thismonth, to the consternation ofmuch of hiscabinet, he signed a lawabolishingtuitionfeesforstudentsin state universities.When asked howthe governmentwouldpayforthis, he replied, “I don’tknow, we’llhave to see.” Bythe same token, he haspromised to restrictseverelythe sorts oftemporarycontractsunderwhich around30% ofFilipinosare employed. He haspledged allegiance to China in exchangeforinvestmentin infrastructure. And, inApril, he announced a plan to suspend im-portsofrice to help local farmers.Economistspointoutthatabolishinguniversitytuition will be more ofa subsi-dyforthe rich than the poor, since just 12%ofstudentscome from the poorest20% offamilies.

MrYameen isnowfouryearsinto hisﬁve-yearterm. He hassurvived an assassination attempt, rowswith assorted vice-presidentsand a hugecorruption scandal (he blamesone ofhisveeps).

Australia’sconstitution bansfrom thefederal parliamentanyone who isunder“acknowledgmentofallegiance, obedi-ence oradherence to a foreign power”, orwho is“a subjectora citizen orentitled tothe rightsorprivilegesofa subject ora citi-zen ofa foreign power”. Butin a country ofhigh immigration, these stricturesare caus-ingunexpected political turmoil.

He leftNewZealand when he wasthree, butneverthought“citizenship sticksto youin thatway”. AfewdayslaterLaris-sa Waters, the otherdeputyleaderof theparty, tearfullyannounced herresignation.She had been born in Canada and movedto Australia asa baby, buthad never re-nounced herCanadian citizenship.

MrCanavan saysthathe dis-covered thisonlywhen the citizenship rowﬁrsterupted.MrCanavan gave up hisministerialpost, butnothisSenate seat. MrJoyce, a fel-lowmemberofthe National Party, the ju-niorcoalition partner, tookoverhis port-folio.

He isfam-ousforplayingthe indignantpatriot in arowoverquarantine lawswith JohnnyDepp, a Hollywood actor.

The two coun-triesshare a quieter, more introspective ritual too: memories arehauled outand dusted oﬀand then, aftera greatdeal of tut-tut-tingand head-shakingoverthe follyand sorrowofPartition, theyare putawayagain, and the forgettingresumes.Time hasmade both countriesskilled atthis. Notatforgettingtheirown injuries, to be sure, oratforgettingthe bad thingstheotherside hasdone. SeventyyearsafterIndia and Pakistan wonfreedom from British rule, theirmutual forgetfulnesshas more todo with ignoring, orperhapssimplynotnoticing, howmuch un-ﬁnished businessremainsfrom Partition, and howfewof itsles-sonshave reallysunkin. The hardestone isthe insidious natureofthe veryidea ofdividingpeople alongreligiouslines. Such forgettingisnotmerelya matterof, forinstance, prefer-ringnotto thinkverymuch aboutthe troubled region of Kashmir.Thisiswhere, in the attemptto separate the two newcountriesneatlyin 1947, the zipper, so to speak, gotstuck. Itremainsjammed: India and Pakistan both claim partsoccupied by theother, and each proclaimsthatthe region’speople, themselvesacocktail offaithsand ethnicities, are a natural partof theirownnation. Butjustasthe retreatingBritish colonialists’ hastydraw-ingofbordersbetween the future India and Pakistan relied onguessworkmore than on the inhabitants’ wishes, neitherside hastaken much interestin ﬁndingoutwhatKashmiriswant.There are otheruntidyborders. Until recentlyone of the mess-iestwasbetween India and Bangladesh. So rushed wasthe carv-ingoutofwhatwasthen known asEastPakistan in 1947 thatmanyenclaves, counter-enclavesand even one counter-counter-enclave gottrapped on the “wrong” side ofthe frontierlike bub-blesin amber. India and Bangladesh ﬁnallyﬁxed the anomaly in2015 with an elaborate exchange ofland and people.Pakistan and India have gone some way, too, to tidying inter-nal anomaliesleftbythe British Raj. In the place ofsmall “prince-ly” tributarystates, India hascreated larger, language-based ad-ministrative units. More division would be a good idea: the sizeofUttarPradesh, a state with 220m people thatisa legacyoftheRaj-era United Provinces, makesithard to govern and too inﬂuen-tial in national politics. Belatedly, Pakistan istaking stepsto bringthe runningofthe FederallyAdministered Tribal Areas(FATA), achronicallyviolent, backward region, into line with the restofthecountry. Britain had regarded these landsastoo bothersome torule, and yetuseful asa buﬀer, an formula unhelpful to FATA’speople thatPakistan blindlypreserved.ButmanyofPartition’sunﬁnished challengeshave little to dowith physical borders. Take the saga ofthe Hyderabad Fund. Backin 1948 the Nizam ofHyderabad, then India’sbiggestand richestprincelystate, sentenvoysto London with a purse of£1m to giveto Pakistan, which had been shippinghim arms. Bythe time theydeposited the money, an Indian invasion had forced him toswitch sides. He revoked the order, butthe bankbalked atreturn-ingthe money. The cash, said to amountto £35m ($45m) now, haslanguished in London, with onlylawyersproﬁtingfrom the inter-minable hagglingbetween India, Pakistan and the nizam’sheirs.Anotherdispute requiringSolomonicjustice hasrun almostaslong. Backin 1949, a Hinduidol “miraculously” appeared in-side a mosque in the Indian cityofAyodhya, substantiating, inpopularimagination atleast, claimsthatthe 16th-centurymosque stood on the site ofthe birthplace ofRam, an incarnationofVishnu, a Hindugod, and the hero ofancientepics. Local Hin-dusfeltempowered to claim the site, and India’sgovernmentre-sponded byclosingthe mosque to Muslim prayers.The lawsuitﬁled byMuslimsin 1950, assertingtitle to themosque, isdue to be ruled on byIndia’sSupreme Courtlaterthisyear—ratherlate consideringthat25 yearsago a Hindumob de-stroyed the building. Howeverthe rulingfalls, there is little likeli-hood ofMuslimsprayingatthe site again. Hindunationalistshave successfullyincorporated Ayodhya into theirnarrative ofsuﬀeringand redemption, and the site hasbecome a magnet forpilgrims. Amongitssouvenirstalls, those doingthe briskest tradeare the onesplayingvideoson a loop ofHindufundamentalistsdemolishingthe mosque.The subtextiswidelyunderstood: whateverIndia’spreten-sionsto beinga secularstate, eﬀective powerlieswith itsHindumajority. In recentyears, asthe strength ofthe ruling Hindu-nationalistBharatiya Janata Party(BJP) hasgrown, so too has thenotion thatnon-Hindusare notreallypukka Indians.Muslims, in particular, are often subtlyputin their place. ForIndependence Day, the BJP governmentofUttarPradesh orderedMuslim religiousschools—and no otherschools—to provide vid-eosto prove thattheirstudentshad sungthe national anthem.Earlierthismonth Narendra Modi, India’sprime minister, made agibe atthe country’soutgoingvice-president, Hamid Ansari, whohappensto be a Muslim.

Since comingto powerin 2012 Xi Jin-ping, the president, hasintensiﬁed eﬀortsto build whathe refersto as“cultural conﬁ-dence”. In an extraordinarydenial of itslegacy, the CommunistPartyhastaken topresentingitselfas“the faithful heir” oftra-ditional Chinese culture. “Ourcivilisationhasdeveloped in an unbroken line fromancientto modern times,” MrXi declaredin 2012. In Januarythe governmentsoughtto codifyitsattemptsto “preserve” tradi-tional culture byoutlininga vastarray ofpoliciesthatlocal and national oﬃcialsshould advance. Individual elementsofthe policy topromote “the integration ofleisure life andtraditional cultural development” soundratherbenign. Taken together, however,theyconstitute an attemptto infuse dailylife with a sanitised and government-sanc-tioned version ofChinese culture.

Promotingthe country’sculturalheritage isa safersource ofpatriotism thananti-Japanese feeling, which the party hadbeen stokingformanyyearsand whichbackﬁred in 2012 when demonstrationsagainstJapan turned violent.

Betterto control them itself. 7WHETHERin the breathlessyearsofdouble-digiteconomicgrowth or to-day’smore languid era, one constantinChina hasbeen the poorstate ofworkers’rightsand the frequentoutbreaksoflabourunrest. From coalminersin the snowynorth-eastto factorystaﬀin the steamyPearl RiverDelta, workershave agitatedagainstlowpay, wage arrears, unsafe con-ditionsand job losses. Alawon labourcontractsthattookeﬀectin 2008 aimed tokeep Chinese hard-hatshappier, and onpaperitshould have succeeded. Indeed,the worldwide rankingofemployment-protection lawsbythe Organisation forEconomicCo-operation and Develop-ment, a rich-countrythink-tank, puts Chi-na nearthe verytop ofthe tableson sever-al indicators. In practice, however, the lawhas onlyhelped a bit. The lackofindependentun-ionsorgenuine collective bargainingleavesChina’sblue-collarworkersvulner-able and grumpy. Incidentsoflabourun-restremain widespread. Around 600strikesorprotestshave been reported thisyear, accordingto researchersatChina La-bourBulletin, a HongKong-based watch-dog, who reckon thistallyofknown inci-dentsmayrepresentonly10-15% oftheactual number. The governmentistryingto keep unrestin checkbyloweringthethreshold atwhich the police intervene. InBeijingprotestsused to be broken up if 50workersshowed up; nowten will suﬃce. Buteven though the lawhasleftblue-collarworkersin the lurch, ithasbroughtconsiderable, unintended beneﬁtsforwhite-collarones. Managersin all sorts ofcompanies—Chinese, foreign, state-ownedand private—complain thatthe lawmakesitdiﬃcultto ﬁre oﬃce staﬀ, even in casesofegregiousmalfeasance. “When the lawwaswritten, we didn’tanticipate this,”saysWangKan ofthe China Institute of In-dustrial Relations. He describesa case involvinga seniorexecutive ata bigtechnologycompanywho wascaughtsubcontractingworkatgrosslyinﬂated pricesto a ﬁrm that he hadestablished usinga relative’sname. Hisemployerwasunable to meetthe exten-sive documentaryand procedural require-mentslaid outin the law, so could not dis-misshim. The executive’sdepartureinstead came on termshe dictated: he gotahuge payoutand the ﬁrm he wasleavingeven waived non-compete restrictionsitwould normallyhave imposed.Blue-collarworkersmayhave even lessjob securitythan before, partlybecause ofslowinggrowth and the closure ofsomestate-owned ﬁrms. Yettheyare often un-able to use the labourlawto protect them-selves. Manyofthem, especiallythe tensofmillionsofmigrantworkerswho roamfrom job to job in construction and otherlowlyroles, are taken on withoutformalcontracts, saysAaron Halegua ofNewYorkUniversity, even though thatcontravenesthe lawin itself. Ifan employerdenies anyrelationship with a workerand there areno documentsto prove one, he says, theworker’scase will seldom reach a court orarbitration panel. Professionalshave also been betterable to use the labourlawbecause they arepaid enough to hire legal help. Lawyers arenotallowed to take on casesin exchangefora share ofanysettlement.Theoreticallythe All-China Federation ofTrade Unions,an umbrella forall Chinese unions, oﬀerslegal aid to blue-collarworkersaspart ofitsmandate. Since itiscompletelycontrolledbythe CommunistParty, however, ittypi-callyprizesthe government’sdesire forsta-bilityoverworkers’ callsforfairness. China doeshave a handful ofcam-paigninglawyersand NGOsthatseekto of-ferlegal help to abused blue-collarwork-ers, buttheyare routinelymetwithprofessional censure orworse formsof in-timidation.

MrTrump in-sisted thatthere is“blame on both sides”,and thaton both sides—amongthosemarchingin supportofethniccleansingand white supremacyand those who op-posed both—there were “veryﬁne people”.Some ofthe marchers, he claimed,were justthere to protestagainstthe re-moval ofConfederate statues, a trend op-posed bysome ofthe president’ssuppor-ters. He worried thatremovingmoreConfederate statuescould lead to remov-ingstatuesofGeorge Washington andThomasJeﬀerson, seeminglyindiﬀerent tothe distinction thatWashington and Jeﬀer-son founded the Union, while Lee and oth-erConfederatestookup armsagainstit.From the sidelineshisnewchiefofstaﬀ,John Kelly, hired to bringdiscipline to theWhite House, stared atthe ground deject-edly, hisarmsfolded in frontofhim.MrTrump defended histepid ﬁrst state-mentbyclaiminghe had notthen had allthe facts, displayinga previouslyunre-vealed concern foraccuracy.

Several othersfollowed MrFrazieroﬀthe council (seepage 51) before MrTrump disbanded it. Butto MrTrump the violence in Charlottes-ville wasauthorlessand disembodied, asad butinherentpartoflife, like badweather. “It’sbeen goingon fora longtimein ourcountry,” he sighed. “It’snotDonaldTrump, it’snotBarackObama.”gressional Republicansmanaged, in thewordsofCoryGardner, a senatorfromColorado, to “call evil byitsname. Thesewere white supremacistsand thiswasdo-mesticterrorism.”And yetDonald Trump seemed to ﬁndthistaskdiﬃcult. On Saturdaynight hemanaged a mealy-mouthed condemna-tion of“hatred, bigotryand violence—onmanysides, on manysides”, even thoughonlyone side appearsto have paradedwith heavyweaponryand murdered oneofitsopponents. Notuntil Mondayafter-noon, and then onlyaftercrowingover hisadministration’seconomictriumphs, didMrTrump manage to admitthat“racism isevil”. And, he added, “those who cause vi-olence in itsname are criminalsand thugs,includingthe KKK, neo-Nazis, white su-premacistsand otherhate groupsthat arerepugnantto everythingwe hold dearasAmericans.” Even then, hisadvisersre-portedlyhad to cajole him into it.Hiseﬀortsatmoral clarityproved ﬂeet-ing.

MrTrump, he says, “hasenergised the white-supremacistmovement…We’re seeingarevival ofstreetactivity.” America hasrarelyundergone a periodofracial retrogression asacute asthatwhich accompanied MrTrump’sassump-tion ofthe presidency.

The Bundhad about25,000 members, and workedcloselywith the Christian Front, a militialinked to CharlesCoughlin, an anti-Semiticpriestwhose radio showsdrewmillions oflisteners. Butafterthe second world warbegan, the Bund’sleaderwasconvicted ofembezzlementand eventuallydeported toGermany, while Coughlin wasordered tocease non-pastoral activity.In 1925 the KuKluxKlan, a violent groupformed in the South afterthe civil war tointimidate newlyfreed blacksoutherners,marched on Washington, and boastedmore than 4m members. Itgained adher-entsin the north and Midwestbyopposingimmigration, particularlyofCatholics andJews. The Klan’sinﬂuence waned, butthenrose again in the 1960s, in opposition to thecivil-rightsmovement. The Southern Pov-ertyLawCentre, which monitorshategroups, estimatesthattodaythe Klan hasbetween 5,000 and 8,000 membersin doz-ensofindividual chapters. The closestthe farrightcame to theWhite House wasin 1968, when GeorgeWallace, an ex-governorofAlabama, tookﬁve statesin the presidential election run-ningon the American IndependentParty’sticket. Wallace began hiscareerasa relativemoderate, then found thatincitingracialhatred won him more votes. Buthisappealwasclearlylimited, even though he wonmore statesthan some subsequentDemo-craticcandidateshave. Since then, mostmainstream politicianshave found iteasyto condemn overtbigotry.There were fewifanyKlan hoodsondisplayin Charlottesville. Instead, march-ersbore a varietyofothericonography.Some brandished white shieldswith ablackcross—a symbol ofthe League of theSouth, a secessionistgroup thatbelievescontemporaryAmerica isunacceptably“egalitarian and Marxist”.

Stephen Bannon, MrTrump’sstrat-egist, once called Breitbart, the website heused to run, “the platform forthe alt-right”.Workingoutpreciselywhatthatmeansischallenging: the alt-rightdoesnot have auniﬁed setofbeliefs.

The Tex-an constitution givesthe governorthe op-tion ofcallingspecial legislative sessions toaddressissuesleftlingeringafterthe Legis-lature’sbrief, biennial regularmeetings.And thisyearthe governor, GregAbbott,had little choice butto do so. The 85th Leg-islature adjourned, in May, withouthavingpassed legislation required to reauthoriseseveral state agencies, includingthe TexasMedical Board, which licensesdoctors. Thiswasa crisismanufactured by thelieutenant-governor, Dan Patrick, who iswidelythoughtto be interested in ascend-ingto the governor’soﬃce. MrAbbottre-sponded, in June, bydoublingdown. Thelegislatorswould return, he announced,and thatbeingthe case, theyshould get towork. He announced a listof20 issuesheexpected them to tackle overthe course ofthe special session, which would run for30 days. Hislistincluded mainstream con-cerns, such asschool ﬁnance and thestate’sstaggeringlyhigh maternal mortal-ityrate, butalso red-meatpolitical priori-ties; amongotherthings, the governorwanted legislation concerningwhich lava-toriestransgenderTexansmightuse. Democrats, who are outnumbered inboth chambers, were unenthused aboutbeingsentbackto Austin to tackle the go-vernor’sto-do listafteran acrimoniousregularsession which ended in threats ofviolence. WhatMrAbbottseeminglyfailed to anticipate isthatso manyRepub-licanswould be, too. Theirhumourdid notimprove afterhe announced thathewould be keepinga dailytallyofthosewho had signed on to supporteach ofhispriorities. Bythe end ofthe session, severalhad openlyscoﬀed atthe governor’sef-fortsatintimidation.Chiefamongthem, asusual, wasHouse SpeakerJoe Straus.

MrStraus, whose con-trol overhisfellowRepublicansin the low-erchamberiscomparativelyweakerthanMrPatrick’sisovertheircolleaguesin theSenate, made itclearthathe sawno partic-ularreason forthe House to followsuit.

So it isa re-liefthatoverthe pasttwo years, as the la-bourmarkethasimproved, Americansaged 25 to 54 (prime-age, in the jargon) havebeen joiningthe labourforce in greaternumbers. Whatisremarkable, however, isthatthisturnaround hasbeen driven al-mostentirelybywomen.When people thinkaboutAmerica’shidden reservesoflabour, theyusuallypointto prime-age men, who have partici-pated in the labourmarketatever-lowerratessince the 1960s. Thingshave been par-ticularlybad forlesseducated men, whohave suﬀered astechnological progressand trade have killed oﬀmanufacturingjobs. More than one in ﬁve prime-age menwith a high-school diploma doesnotwork, compared with fewerthan one in 11men with a bachelor’sdegree.Yetin recentdecadeswomen’semploy-mentrateshave been disappointing, too.In 1990, aftertwo decadesin which wom-en had piled into the workforce, America’sfemale labour-force participation wassixth-highestamong22 rich countriesstud-ied byeconomistsFrancine Blauand Law-rence Kahn in 2013. The ﬂowofwomeninto workslowed to a trickle bythe turn ofthe millennium. Then itwentinto a verygentle decline. Because othercountriescontinued to see gains, by2010 Americahad slipped to 17th in MsBlauand MrKahn’srankings. Theypointed to Ameri-ca’sfailure to implementthe family-friend-lypoliciesfollowed elsewhere.Nonetheless, the top end ofthe labourmarketisincreasinglypromisingforwom-en. Even in 2010, America’sworkingwom-en were aboutaslikelyto be managers asmen; elsewhere, theywere onlyhalfaslikely. Theywere also more likelythanmen to be professionals. Women are nowamajorityamongnewcollege graduates,make up more than halfoflawstudents,and are equallyrepresented amongfresh-men atmedical schools. Women in theirlate 20sand early30sare responsible fornearly40% oflabour-force growthsinceprime-age participation bottomed outinAugust2015.Yetwhen WhitneyMancuso and JohnRobertson ofthe Federal Reserve Bank ofAtlanta recentlycrunched the numbers,theyfound the recentsurge in participa-tion had been driven byunskilled women.Accordingto theiranalysis, abouta ﬁfth ofthe growth in female prime-age participa-tion overthe pastyearisexplained by shift-ingpatternsofage and education. Stripthose demographicchangesoutofthetrend, and higherparticipation bywomenwithoutcollege degreesexplainsfully 97%ofwhatremains.Itiseasyto explain whyparticipation isboomingamonglesseducated workers.Theytend to be the ﬁrstto suﬀerfrom reces-sionsand the lastto beneﬁtfrom recover-ies, and the labourmarkethasonlyrecent-lyentered itsﬁnal stagesofconvalescenceafterthe ﬁnancial crisis. Median earningsare nowgrowingbyover4% annuallyamongfull-time employeeswith onlyahigh-school diploma, compared with 2.9%forthose with a bachelor’sdegree. Whatisfarlessclear, however, iswhywomenalone are responsible forthe turnaround.Isabel Sawhill, ofthe BrookingsInstitu-tion, a think-tank, oﬀersone explanation:low-skilled job openingshave been con-centrated in service industriesthatdo notattractmen. Meanwhile, traditionallymale jobs, forexample in construction,have been harderto come by. Sure enough,there isa correlation between the numberofwomen an industryemploys, asa per-centage ofitsworkforce, and howmanynon-managerial jobsithasrecentlycreated. Particularlystrikingisthe educa-tion-and-health-servicessector, wherewomen make up three-quartersoftheworkforce. Itaccountsformore than 25% ofnetnewnon-managerial jobsin the priv-ate sectoroverthe pastyear. Mostof theserolesare in health and social care, which isboomingasthe population ages. Yetplentyofmen are workingin low-skilled jobsthatdo notinvolve traditional“man’swork”. The leisure and hospitalityindustry, forexample, hasan almostequalgendersplit. Ithasadded 287,000 non-managerial jobsin the pastyear, andwagesare up bya healthy3.5%. Thissug-geststhatthe full explanation ismore sub-tle than men notwantingcertain types ofwork. Itmayinclude a simple piece of eco-nomics. Researchersthinkthatwomen’slabour-marketchoicesdepend more onwagesthan men’sdo. Thismakessensewhen women are theirhousehold’ssec-ondaryearner. Asa result, recentwagegrowth mayhave tempted more womenthan men into the workforce. However, thegap in sensitivityto wageshasdroppeddramaticallyin recentdecades. And in anycase, thisargumentcannotexplain the sizeofthe disparitybetween genders.Whateverthe cause, the evidence isthatplentyofunskilled women on theedgesofthe labourforce can be temptedin. Meanwhile, a large numberofmenseem cutoﬀfrom the modern economyal-together. These are notjustformermanu-facturingworkers, butyoungsterstoo. Theparticipation rate ofmen aged 25-34 isonlyatouch above itsrecord low; forsimilarlyaged women, itisashigh asitwasat thestartof2001. One theoryforwhyyoungmen are increasinglyaverse to working,proposed byErikHurst, an economist, andhisco-authorsin a recentworkingpaper, isthe pull ofmodern video games. Policy-makersstill have theirworkcutouthelpingwomen into the labourforce. Recenttrendshave notchanged the factthat, in most agegroups, manymore men than womenwork. Butsocietyalso needsto think aboutagrowinggroup ofmen forwhom workdoesnotseem to be a worthwhile aim,howevermuch the economybooms. 7The female workforceAll the workingladiesWASHINGTON, DCWomen are responsible fora recoveryin labour-force participationA woman’s worldSources: Bureau of Labour Statistics; The EconomistUnited States, prime-age civilian labour forceGrowth in excess of population growth since August 2015By age and sex, m201516170.500.51.01.5+–25-3435-4445-54MenAged:WomenIn the pinkSources: Bureau of LabourStatistics; The Economist*Production andnonsupervisory rolesUnited StatesShare of women in workforce, 2016, %Job growth*, July 2016 - July 2017, ’0000204060800200400600Mining and loggingConstructionManufacturingTrade, transportation and utilitiesFinancialactivitiesProfessional andbusiness servicesEducationand healthservicesLeisure andhospitalityOther servicesThe EconomistAugust19th2017 UnitedStates33TO KNOWhowthe world achesfora more familiarAmerica toreturn, itisenough to watch foreign leadersinteract with Vice-PresidentMike Pence. In more normal times, MrPence wouldmake an unlikelyobjectofglobal fascination. Missionary-ear-nestand sternlyconservative, he wearshisloyaltyto DonaldTrump like a blankmask. There isno Trump provocation that thevice-presidentcannotexplain away: usuallyin tonesof mild,head-shakingdisappointment, asifotherslackthe good sense totrusthisboss. Buteven asMrPence defendshispresident and hisAmerica Firstagenda, he soundsenough like an old-school Rea-gan Republican—praisingfree-trade pacts, laudingNATOandchidingleftiststrongmen fortramplingthe rule oflaw—that for-eign alliescannothelp butdream. To us, saysan oﬃcial from one offourLatin American coun-trieshostingMrPence from August13th to 18th, thisvice-presidentsomehowrepresentsall the institutionsofAmerica, not justthisWhite House. He soundslike the senatorswe meet, and we knowhe isliked bymanyRepublicansin Congress. Also, says the oﬃ-cial, loweringhisvoice, MrPence could be presidentone day. Giv-en the legal and political briarsthatentangle MrTrump afterjustseven monthsin oﬃce, thatisa fairpoint.ATrumpian controversywasawaitingMrPence athisﬁrststop, Colombia. Thatcountry’scentristpresident, Juan ManuelSantos, had everyinterestin givinghisAmerican visitor a cordialwelcome. MrSantosneedsalliesashe nursesa fragile economyand implementsan unpopularpeace agreementwith FARCre-bels. MrSantoshosted MrPence and hiswife Karen foran open-airdinnerin the portcityofCartagena, in the grounds ofa coral-stone mansion. Blue macawsand high-ﬂyingfrigatebirdswheeled overhead. Modesttrade dealswere announced: Ameri-ca will acceptmore Colombian avocados, Colombia will buymore Yanqui rice. MrSantosendorsed American callsfortoughersanctionson Venezuela’sleftistrulers, astheyslide closer to dic-tatorship. Butasa politician in a continenthaunted by memoriesofAmerican-backed coups, and stalked todaybyleft-wing popu-lists, MrSantoshad no choice butto addresscommentsmade byMrTrump, a fewdaysearlier, suggestingthatoptionsfor restoringdemocracyin Venezuela include militaryforce. “Friendshave totell each otherthe truth,” MrSantostold hisguest. Amilitary op-tion should not“even be considered”.In reply, MrPence relied on a favourite gambit: selectivelyquotingMrTrump to make hisbosssound more like Reagan thanRambo. Indeed, MrTrump said thatAmerica has“manyoptionsforVenezuela”, soothed MrPence. Butthe presidentremains con-ﬁdentthat, workingwith Latin American allies, peaceful wayswill be found to restore Venezuelan democracy. Whatthe worldheard was“resolve and determination” from MrTrump, the vice-presidentadded, in case anyone thoughttheyhad heard Ameri-ca’spresidentindulgingin blusteringwar-talkthatmakes no mil-itarysense, givesVenezuela’srulersa propaganda win, andmakeslife harderforhisown allies. Asnightfell over CartagenaMrPence reached fora line thathe usesoften to explain Trump-ian foreign policy. UnderPresidentTrump, the government willalwaysputAmerican’ssecurityand prosperityﬁrst, he said: but“America Firstdoesnotmean America alone.”The electoral mandate won byMrTrump weighsheavilyonMrPence.

In Cartagenahe bowed hishead, eyesclosed, asMrsPence led a prayer circlewith Venezuelanstakingrefuge atan American-backed evangeli-cal church. “The presidentsentme here with a message ofcom-passion,” MrPence told them, visiblymoved. Nobodywasawk-ward enough to askhowthatsquareswith hisboss’sfear-mongeringagainstrefugees, orfrequentpraise for despoticstrongmen elsewhere in the world. In BuenosAiresMrPencepraised PresidentMauricio Macri forloweringtrade tariﬀs, with-outmentioningMrTrump’sthreatsto slap tariﬀson imports. MrPence hailed Argentina’srole in the World Trade Organisation,though hisbosscallsthatbody“anotherone ofourdisasters”.Swaggerﬁxes everythingIfpressed on such contradictions, MrPence hasan answer: over-all, MrTrump’stough talkmakesthe world safer. Citingthe recentUNSecurityCouncil vote to sanction North Korea, and pan-American eﬀortsto putpressure on Venezuela, MrPence claimedin BuenosAiresthatMrTrump had “broughtthe kind ofbroad-shouldered leadership to the world stage thathasbeen lackingfortoo long, and the world welcomesit.”Loyaltyisa noble quality. Publicloyaltyisalso key whenworkingforMrTrump, a vengeful and insecure man. Both factsmayexplain whyMrPence quotesthe presidentconstantly anddeferentiallystressesthe “high honour” ofrepresentinghim.Travel liftsthe maska bit. Like manynationalists, Mr Trumpdoesnotgreatlycare thatforeign countrieshave politics, too. MrPence ismore alive to questionsofforeign opinion, which iswhyhe laboursto presentthe world with the mostconstructive ver-sion ofhisboss.

The IMF ex-pectsGDP growth ofjust0.3% thisyear. Thejoblessnessrate is13%. Lastyear’sﬁscal def-icit, includinglarge interestpayments, wasnearly9% ofGDP. Lower-than-expectedtaxreceiptshave forced the government toacceptthatforthe nextfouryearsthe bud-getdeﬁcitwill be higherthan planned.Butmarketsseem unperturbed.

NotAlgeria. Itskin-dergartensare a linguisticmorass. Therepublic’soﬃcial language isstandardArabic, butfewchildren growup speak-ingit, so theyoften feel loston their ﬁrstdayofschool. Berber, the tongue ofperhapsa quarterofAlgerians, wasoﬃciallyrecognised lastyear—but no onecan agree on which ofitssixdialects toteach. Algeria’sFrench-speakingeliteprefertheirold masters’ lingo. The educa-tion minister, Nouria Benghebrit, ad-vocatesthe introduction ofa fourthlanguage: Darija, which fusesthe otherthree and isthe mothertongue ofmostAlgerians.

Algeria’sundergradu-atesstudylaw, politicsand religion inArabic, butprettymuch everythingelsein French. Courtproceedings, newsbulletinsand Fridaysermonsare inArabic. Sitcoms, increasingly, are home-made and in Darija. Butcabinetsessionsare mostlyin French, asare businessmeetingsand literarysalons.

JamesOrengo,one ofMrOdinga’sclosestallies,said thatthe announcementwasa “cha-rade” and thatthe commission wasin ca-hootswith the government. “Kenyansal-waysrise up,” he wenton. Ashe spoke, anominoussilence descended on Nairobi,the capital, aspeople stayed inside.Yetin the end, the uprisingwasrelative-lysubdued. In MrOdinga’sstrongholds, inthe slumsofNairobi and in Western Ken-ya, protestersblocked roadsand burnedtyres. The police responded with typicalbrutality, ﬁringteargasand live roundsinto the crowds. Aftera fewdays, at leasttwo dozen people were dead, including anine-year-old girl who washitbya straybulletand a six-month-old babywho wasclubbed on the head. Butthe violence didnotspread beyonda fewhotspots, nordiditproduce bloodshed alongethniclines, ofthe sortthatleftsome 1,400 people deadafterdisputed electionsin 2007.AsThe Economistwentto press, thepost-election crisiswashardlyresolved. Atapressconference on August16th, MrOd-inga repeated hisassertion thatthe elec-tion wasstolen from him, sayingthat Uhu-ruKenyatta (pictured above) wasre-elected by“computer-generated fraud”.Almosta quarterofthe 41,000 formsthatoﬃciallyrecorded the resultshad still notbeen released bythe electoral commis-sion, makingitdiﬃcultto disprove MrOd-inga’sclaims. Two NGOsthathave beencritical ofthe election process, and whichwere involved in a petition againstthe re-sult, have been threatened with closure bythe government. Butitseemsmore likelythatMrOd-inga’sprotestswill ﬁzzle outthan thattheywill explode. He called fornon-violentprotestsand said thathe will contest the re-sultatKenya’ssupreme court, ratherthanon the streets. Neitherprospectwill muchtrouble MrKenyatta. UnlessMrOdingacan provide deﬁnitive evidence ofrigging,ambassadorsofWestern countrieshavemade clearthathe should give up. The diminishingtension, however, isfarfrom the end ofMrKenyatta’spro-blems.

Overthe years, loyal crowdshavelapped up experimental interpretationsofRussian classics andstrikingnewworks. “MüllerMachine”, a homage to the Germanplaywright, HeinerMüller, featured a troupe ofnaked actors gy-ratingon stage. In the restofEurope, MrSerebrennikov iscelebrat-ed. Hismostrecentﬁlm, “The Student”, won the FrançoisChalaisprize atthe CannesFilm Festival in 2016; thisyearhe tookhomethe Europe Prize forNewTheatrical Realities. Yethe facesa diﬀerentcultural landscape in Russia, where re-actionarieshave been in the ascendantin recentyears(a phe-nomenon that“The Student” satirised). MrPutin’sthird presiden-tial term began, in 2012, underthe bannerofa return to traditionalconservative values. Harsh lawstargeted “gaypropaganda”; theRussian Orthodoxchurch came to exertevermore inﬂuence overculture. Religiousfanaticshave attacked exhibitionsdeemed tobe “oﬀensive”. Late lastyearone such group splashed urine on anexhibition ofthe workofJockSturges, an American photogra-pherwho shootsnude portraitsofparentsand theirchildren.“We don’tneed European culture here,” one vandal shouted. In MayMrSerebrennikovalso found himselfunderattack. Of-ﬁcersfrom the Federal SecurityService raided the Gogol Centre,searched hishome and whisked him oﬀforquestioning. Russia’santi-corruption Investigative Committee, a bodythatreports di-rectlyto the president, alleged thatMrSerebrennikov’sproduc-tion company, Studio Seven, had embezzled some 200m roubles($3.4m) ofstate fundsbetween 2011and 2014. The studio’sﬁnan-cial directorand itsaccountantwere arrested. MrSerebrennikovhasbeen called asa witness, and hisforeign passportseized. Dur-inginitial hearings, the prosecution even claimed that the studiohad neveractuallystaged a production of“AMidsummerNight’sDream” forwhich itreceived publicmoney. Theyargued thatreamsofreviewsand a nomination forthe Golden Mask, Russia’sleadingtheatrical award, were insuﬃcientevidence of theshow’sexistence. Gogol himselfcould hardlyhave devised amore farcical plot. Ifthe pointofthe proceedingswasto intimidate, it seemstohave worked. Alla Shenderova, a theatre critic, saysthe case hasgenerated “an atmosphere offearand hysteria” amongthe intelli-gentsia. Even more established ﬁgureshave expressed anxiety. Atan awardsceremonyYevgenyMironov, a respected director atMoscow’sTheatre ofNations, passed MrPutin a letterof supportforMrSerebrennikovfrom cultural heavyweights. He arguedthatthe prosecution could undermine the president’sforthcom-ingvisitto France; MrPutin, in earshotofreporters, agreed, callingthose intimidatingMrSerebrennikov“idiots”.

Here is how we imagine itto: James Damore, cc: All staffInbox     xDear James,You’re probably expecting me to start this reply by claiming that there are no differences in the average abilities, aptitudes and interests of men and women. Or that the fact that four times as many of Google’s software engineers are men than are women is proof of discrimination. I’m not going to do either of those things. There is good evidence for dozens of such differences between the average man and average woman. And as a matter of pure logic, you are correct that the gender gap in our team of software engineers is not of itself proof of sexism or discrimination.I am happy to acknowledge that you state your support for gender diversity and fairness. Your memo starts: “I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don’t endorse using stereotypes.” So, you and anyone else who reads this may be wondering, why the fuss? Why did your memo go viral? Why did it cause such fury? Why did we fire you? In interviews and an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal you have said it’s because Google is “ideologically driven and intolerant of scientific debate”, and therefore unable to tolerate your “reasoned, well-researched, good-faith argument”. You’ve driven the point home with your “Goolag” T-shirt and new twitter handle, @Fired4Truth.Your interpretation is wrong. Your memo was a great example of what’s called “motivated reasoning”—seeking out only the information that supports what you already believe. It was derogatory to women in our industry and elsewhere. Despite your stated support for diversity and fairness, it demonstrated profound prejudice. Your chain of reasoning had so many missing links that it hardly mattered what your argument was based on. We try to hire people who are willing to follow where the facts lead, whatever their preconceptions. In your case we clearly made a mistake.Have you ever noticed how no one takes sentences that start “I’m not a racist, but…” at face value? Here’s why, in the words of Jon Snow in “Game of Thrones” (season 7, episode 1). When Sansa Stark tells him: “They respect you, they really do, but…,” Snow laughs and comes back with: “What did father used to say? Everything before the word ‘but’ is horseshit.” I thought of that line when I read this section in your memo: “Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the work-place differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story. On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways…” All your comments about valuing diversity and fairness came before that giant “but”. What came after it Mail1 of manyThe e-mail Larry Page should have written to James DamoreThe EconomistAugust19th2017 International47There is plenty of evidence that women in Silicon Valley suffer sexism and discrimination. Read Susan Fowler’s description of the harassment she experienced at Uber before leaving the firm in December. Look at the responses to “Elephant in the Valley”, a recent survey of senior women in tech: among its findings was that two-thirds had been excluded from networking opportunities because of their sex. And beyond our industry, women are less likely than men to be given plum assignments, are given less useful feedback, are seen as pushy when they ask for pay rises (men are seen as ambitious) and, in leadership roles, may be seen as either competent or likeable, but rarely both. “We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism,” you write. But we know there is sexism! We don’t need to infer it from the existence of gender gaps.It is more than likely that some psychological differences between men and women have been baked in by evolution, as you note. We see such differences, in varying degrees, in pretty much every animal. With humans, though, you must take great care before concluding that any specific difference is innate, since our societies are so much more complex and varied than those of other animals. (By the way, I find it blackly funny that some of the conservatives who have seized on you as a hero don’t believe in evolution at all.) Here are some reasons to be doubtful about an evolutionary basis for the specific differences you cite. Before the 1980s, when personal computers became more common and were almost exclusively marketed to men and boys, a much bigger share of those studying computer science at university in America were girls than is the case now. The share of computer scientists who are women varies wildly from country to country. Even personality differences vary from time to time and place to place—for example men are more agreeable (the term used by psychologists for a cluster of traits such as modesty, altruism and tender-mindedness), and less ambitious and status-seek-ing, in more hierarchical countries. That suggests that at least some of the gaps we see in America are because women are still relatively powerless, just as most men are in more traditional societies. Moreover, those supposedly “female” traits vanish in the rare arenas where the competition is entirely among women. Sopranos and ballerinas are hardly famous for being indifferent about who gets top billing.I said you didn’t understand what made a great software engineer. If we were talking about weight-lifters or contortionists, it would be simple—and your stylised bell-curve diagram would be the whole story. Men are on average so much stronger, and women so much more supple, that almost all the highest performers are from one sex or the other. But few jobs are that was a description of a few gender differences, your argument that they explain why so many of our software engineers are men and your complaint that Google’s attempts to change that balance, far from being about fairness to women, amount to anti-male bias. You use the words “discriminate” or “discrimina-tion” 17 times, exclusively to describe men as victims.Now that we’ve worked out what your memo’s really about, let’s examine its argument. These are the main gender differences you cite: women’s on-average greater interest, compared with men, in people and lesser interest in things; their relatively greater tendency to “empathise” rather than “systematise”, and to be agreeable rather than assertive; and their relatively higher anxiety and lower tolerance for stress. You present a diagram of two normal distributions, with the same standard deviations but slightly different means, to demonstrate that small differences in group averages can result in large differences when it comes to outliers. (The Economist’s data team has kindly redrawn this for me, highlighting the “tail” of the distribution with the higher mean.) The point of this simplified model is to demonstrate that, of everyone who scores very highly on the variable under consider-ation, many more will be from the group with the higher average. Then you make a giant leap from group differences between men and women on such measures as interest in people rather than things, or systematising versus empathising, to differences in men’s and women’s ability to code. At least that’s what you seem to be doing; you don’t quite say so. There is no evidence for such an inference. And that is only the first flaw in your argument. I can see at least six more, any of which would derail it on its own. First, you ignore many other gender differences, basing your argument only on a few that you think support your conclusion. Second, you’re ignoring everything else that could explain the gender gap. Third, the gender differences you cite differ between countries and over time. Fourth, they don’t even support your argument, because you don’t seem to understand what makes a great software engineer. Fifth, you clearly don’t understand our company, and so fail to understand what we are trying to do when we hire. And sixth, even if you are right that more men than women are well-suited to the job of software engineer at Google, you are wrong that taking steps to recruit more women is inherently unfair to men.Your memo was a triumph of motivated reasoning: heads men win; tails women lose. Here are a few psychological differences between the sexes that you didn’t mention. Men score higher on measures of anger, and lower on co-operation and self-disci-pline. If it had been the other way round, I’m betting you would have cited these differences as indicating lack of suitability for the job of coder. You lean on measures of interest and personal-ity, rather than ability and achievement, presumably because the latter don’t support your hypothesis. In many countries girls now do better in pretty much every subject at school than boys; again, if it had been the other way around I’m sure you wouldn’t have neglected to mention that fact. The sole published comparison of competency in coding I am aware of found that women were more likely than men to have their GitHub contributions accepted—but if they were project outsiders, this was true only if their gender was concealed.Two similar populations:Averagesare close……but at the top end,most come fromone group48InternationalThe EconomistAugust19th2017Larry Page | Co-founder of Google | CEO of Alphabet Inc. | +LarryPageAlphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California, United StatesNotice: This e-mail may contain confidential material. If you are not an intended recipient, please notify the sender and delete all copies.This e-mail memo is imagined by Economist journalists. It was not written by Larry Page or any other Google employee.one-dimensional. Software engineering requires a broad mix of skills involving both “people” and “things”. Teamwork, in particular, is important—the stereotypical image of the geek working alone in his basement is far from reality. Senior engineers must manage teams—and by your own reasoning that should mean that women, with their greater empathy and interest in people, should be over-represented at that level, compared with their numbers in more junior jobs. That they are not should have given you pause.Many of the problems in our industry are caused by the sorts of misconceptions about the job that you clearly hold. Failures of teamwork and product testing are part of the reason so many new releases are glitchy, and so many projects run over time and over budget. I can even point you to ways that products fail because too few women have been involved in their develop-ment. When Google Plus was launched users had to state their gender to sign up. The intention was to make it easier to send notifications such as “She shared a photo with you.” Presumably it didn’t occur to anyone involved in development—all of them men—that many women choose to conceal their sex online to cut down on harassment. Such failures matter far beyond our industry, because tech increasingly reaches into every aspect of modern life. I don’t want Google to be part of building a virtual world that is a bad fit for a big chunk of humanity, as office designers, carmakers and pharmaceutical companies already did in the offline world. (Did you know that car seats and office desks are the wrong proportions for most women, or that many drugs in widespread use were only ever tested on men?) Finally, let’s look at your contention that by trying to recruit more women Google is discriminating against men. You seem to think that if we stopped paying any attention to applicants’ gender when deciding who to hire, we would naturally converge on the “right” share of men and women, that is, the share that matches the distribution of talent in the recruitment pool. I don’t believe that. Unless we make special efforts, some women will be put off applying by the heavily male culture; those doing the hiring will be influenced in their assessments of candidates’ ability by the stereotypes they’ve formed in that male environment. We should “treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group,” you write. That is what we are doing. We’re trying to hire the best, aware that there are forces militating against us.When you first wondered why so few of our software engineers were women, and why we were trying to hire more and whether that was fair, there were plenty of smart things you could have done. You could have asked some of your female colleagues about their experiences in the industry. You could have looked for evidence that conflicted with your biases (there’s a good search engine you could have used). Here’s a brief reading list for you. Sean Stevens and Jonathan Haidt have compiled a pretty comprehensive list of psychologi-cal differences between the sexes—there are plenty, not all point the same way and there are many caveats. J. Doe has summarised the evidence that women are treated worse than men in the tech workplace. Suzanne Sadedin, an evolutionary biologist, debunks your pop evo-psych. Yonatan Zunger, a former senior engineer at Google, discusses your misconcep-tions about our industry. Claire Cain Miller talks about the damaging myth of the loner genius nerd. Cynthia Lee “lady-splains” your errors from the viewpoint of a woman coder.I shouldn’t have had to write this: I’m busy and a little effort on your part would have made it unnecessary. But I know I have it easy. Women in our industry have to cope with this sort of nonsense all the time.Yours,Larry1. The Google memo: What does the research say about gender differences?

In Belgium, home totwo ofthe world’sﬁve biggestdredgers, ef-ﬁciencygainshave been so large that theyhave skewed productivityﬁguresfortheentire buildingsector. The improvementscan be traced to in-dustryconsolidation and investment—thingsthathave eluded mostonshorebuilders. These trendshave been spurredbylarge, demandingcustomers(usuallygovernmentsand energyﬁrms), aswell asbythe greaterneed forprecision atsea,where a tinyslitin an oil pipe can prompt acatastrophe. Asimportant, maritime pro-jectshave become so large and complexthatﬁrmsoften have no choice butto usemachinesratherthan labour. About25 yearsago the sectorwasfrag-mented.

Suniva ﬁled forbankruptcyin April, nine daysbefore launchingthe pe-tition. SolarWorld laid oﬀ360 workerslastmonth. Nearly30 otherAmerican produc-ershave closed down since 2012. So Sunivaand SolarWorld are seekingprotectionsthatwould applyto all importers. The plaintiﬀs’ opponents, includingtheSolarEnergyIndustriesAssociation (SEIA),atrade body, argue thatthe ﬁrms’ mainwoesare self-inﬂicted.

The ﬁrstto layoutthe idea ofexternal-itieswasAlfred Marshall, a British econo-mist. Butitwasone ofhisstudentsat Cam-bridge Universitywho became famousforhisworkon the problem.

He wasuncomfortablewith strangers, butintellectuallybrilliant.Marshall championed him and with theolderman’ssupport, Pigousucceeded himto become head ofthe economicsfacultywhen he wasjust30 yearsold.In 1920 Pigoupublished “The Econom-icsofWelfare”, a dense bookthatoutlinedhisvision ofeconomicsasa toolkitfor im-provingthe livesofthe poor. Externalities,where “self-interestwill not…tend tomake the national dividend a maximum”,were central to histheme. Although Pigousprinkled hisanalysiswith examplesthatwould have appealedto posh students, such ashisconcern forthose whose land mightbe overrun byrab-bitsfrom a neighbouringﬁeld, others re-ﬂected graverproblems. He claimed thatchimneysmoke in London meantthatthere wasonly12% asmuch sunlightaswasastronomicallypossible. Such pollutionimposed huge “uncharged” costson com-munities, in the form ofdirtyclothes andvegetables, and the need forexpensive ar-tiﬁcial light. Ifmarketsworked properly,people would investmore in smoke-pre-vention devices, he thought.Pigouwasopen to diﬀerentwaysoftacklingexternalities. Some thingsshouldbe regulated—he scoﬀed atthe idea that theinvisible hand could guide propertyspecu-latorstowardscreatinga well-plannedtown. Otheractivitiesoughtsimplyto bebanned. No amountof“deceptive activi-ty”—adulteratingfood, forexample—couldgenerate economicbeneﬁts, he reckoned.Buthe sawthe mostobviousforms ofintervention as“bountiesand taxes”.These measureswould use pricesto re-store marketperfection and avoid stran-glingpeople with red tape.

Coase considered externalitiesasa problem ofill-deﬁned propertyrights.Ifitwere feasible to assign such rights prop-erly, people could be leftto bargain theirwayto a good solution withoutthe needfora heavy-handed tax. Coase used the ex-ample ofa confectioner, disturbinga quietdoctorworkingnextdoorwith hisnoisymachinery. Solvingthe conﬂictwith a taxwould make lesssense than the two neigh-boursbargainingtheirwayto a solution.The lawcould assign the rightto be noisyto the sweet-maker, and ifworthwhile, thedoctorcould payhim to be quiet. In mostcases, the sheerhassle of hag-glingwould renderthisunrealistic, a pro-blem thatCoase wasthe ﬁrstto admit. Buthisdeeperpointstands. Before charging inwith a corrective tax, ﬁrstthinkaboutwhich institutionsand lawscurrently inplace could ﬁxthings. Coase pointed outthatlawsagainstnuisance could help ﬁxthe problem ofrabbitsravagingthe land;quietcarriagestodayassign passengers toplacesaccordingto theirnoise preferences. OthersrejectPigou’sapproach on mor-al grounds. Michael Sandel, a political phi-losopheratHarvard University, haswor-ried thatrelyingon pricesand markets toﬁxthe world’sproblemscan end up legiti-misingbad behaviour. When in 1998 oneschool in Haifa tried to encourage parentsto picktheirchildren up on time byﬁningthem, tardypickupsincreased. Itturnedoutthatparental guiltwasa more eﬀectivedeterrentthan cash; makingpaymentsseemsto have assuaged the guilt. Besidesthese more theoretical qualmsaboutPigouvian taxes, policymakersen-counterall mannerofpractical ones. Pigouhimselfadmitted thathisprescriptionswere vague; in “The EconomicsofWel-fare”, though he believed taxeson damag-ingindustriescould beneﬁtsociety, he didnotsaywhich ones. Nordid he spell out inmuch detail howto setthe level ofthe tax. Pricesin the real world are no help;theirfailure to incorporate social costs isthe problem thatneedsto be solved. Get-tingpeople to reveal the precise cost tothem ofsomethinglike clogged roadsisaskinga lot. In areaslike these, policymak-ershave had to settle on a mixture of prag-matism and publicacceptability. London’sinitial £5 ($8)fee fordrivinginto itscity cen-tre wassuspiciouslyround fora summeantto reﬂectthe social costofa trip. Inevitably, a desire to raise revenue alsoplaysa role. Itwould be nice to believe thatpoliticianssetPigouvian taxesmerely inorderto price in an externality, but the evi-dence, and common sense, suggestsother-wise. Research mayhave guided the initiallevel ofa British landﬁll tax, at£7 a tonne in1996. Butotherconsiderationsmayhaveboosted itto £40 a tonne in 2009, andthence to £80 a tonne in 2014.Thingsbecome even harderwhen itcomesto diviningthe social costofcarbonemissions. Economistshave diligentlypoked giganticmodelsofthe global econ-omyto calculate the relationship betweentemperature and GDP. Butsuch exercisesinevitablyrelyon heroicassumptions.And puttinga dollarnumberon environ-mental Armageddon isan ethical ques-tion, aswell asa technical one, relying asitdoeson such judgmentsashowto valueunborn generations. The span ofestimatesofthe economiclossto humanityfrom car-bon emissionsisunhelpfullywide asa re-sult, rangingfrom around $30 to $400 amegatonne. It’s the politics, stupidThe question ofwhere Pigouvian taxes fallisalso tricky. Acommon gripe isthat theyare regressive, punishingpoorerpeople,who, forexample, smoke more and are lessable to cope with risesin heatingcosts. Aneconomistmightshrug: the whole point isto raise the price forwhoeverisgeneratingthe externality. Apolitician cannotaﬀordto be so hard-hearted. When Australia in-troduced a version ofa carbon taxin 2012,more than halfofthe moneyended up be-inggiven backto pensionersand poorerhouseholdsto help with energycosts. Thetaxstill sharpened incentives, the hand-outssoftened the pain.Ataxisalso hard to directvery preciselyatthe worstoﬀenders.

Ithad relinquisheditsformercontrolswithoutnewonesinplace. The answerhasbeen to create a poli-cyrate, much like benchmarkshort-terminterestratesin America and Europe. Thecentral bankhastried to create an equiva-lentanchorin China’sﬁnancial system:the seven-day“repo” rate (the bond-repur-chase rate atwhich itlendsto banks).To do so ithasestablished a bandaround the seven-dayrate, with a lowerbound forlendingto banksﬂush with cashand an upperbound forthose in need. Tocap ratesatthe upperbound, the centralbankalso started acceptinga widerarrayofcollateral. Since mid-2015 thishasworked. The central bankhaskeptthe sev-en-dayrate within the corridorandnudged itup asthe economyhasgatheredpace (see chart1on previouspage). On Au-gust15th, in itsannual reviewofChina’seconomy, the IMFpassed a tentative ver-dict: “The conductofmonetarypolicyin-creasinglyresemblesa standard interest-rate-based framework.”Complementingthisshifthasbeen thecentral bank’screation ofa range ofliquid-ity-managementtools. Since 2013 ithasopened a baﬄingplethora ofnewlendingwindows: short-term liquidityoperations,standinglendingfacilities, medium-termlendingfacilitiesand pledged supplemen-tarylending. All added up to the samething: conduitsto injectcash atdiﬀerentratesand fordiﬀerentdurationsor, bylet-tingthem expire, to withdrawcash.Theirimportance hasbeen clearoverthe pasttwo yearsascapital outﬂows erod-ed the value ofChina’sforeign-exchangereserves. Thisplaced pressure on domesticliquidity, since China had relied on cash in-ﬂowsto generate moneygrowth (issuingnewyuan to buyup the dollarsstreamingin). Afterinitial hiccups, the central bankmore than made up forthe lossofdollarsathome byusingitsvarioustools(see chart2). Asa result, ithasbeen betterable tomanage cash levelson a dailybasis. Highvolatilityin money-marketrates, once aregularoccurrence, hasall butvanished,hence the central bank’sconceitthat, in aQin-like manner, ithasshaved oﬀmoun-tain peaksand ﬁlled valleys.Nevertheless, both policyshiftsareworksin progress. With state-ownedbanksand companiesstill countingongovernmentsupportin the eventoftrou-ble, interestrateshave lesssignalling valuethan in a freermarket.

And its suc-cessin managingliquidityhasbeen greatlyhelped byChina’stightened grip on itscapital accountoverthe pastyear. Withoutthat, moneygrowth athome mighthavefuelled more capital outﬂows. Itis, in otherwords, a gradual approach to reform, inwhich sense the invocation ofChina’sﬁrstemperorisunfortunate.

Some isinvested to earn income;some isgiven awayforgood works. Thetwo activitieshave been seen asseparate.But, in the pontiﬁcate ofPope Francis, thatdivide isblurring. “Impact” investing—in-tended to make moneyand do good atthesame time—isgrowingin importance. It isalso creatingsome controversy. In 2014 the pope, speakingto a confer-ence in the Vatican on impactinvesting,called on Christiansto rediscover“thispre-ciousand primordial unitybetween proﬁtand solidarity”. Hischurch hasresponded.Some Catholicinstitutionswith assets toinvest—includingthe Jesuits, the Francis-can SistersofMaryand Ascension Invest-mentManagement—have earmarked apartoftheirinvestmentsforimpactfunds. Meanwhile, newCatholicimpactfundshave been formed, such asonesundertheOblate International Pastoral InvestmentTrust, which isentrusted with the ﬁnancialresourcesofmore than 200 Catholicorga-nisationsfrom over50 countries. Othershave joined co-operative eﬀortsto aligntheirinvestmentstrategies. The CatholicImpactInvestingCollaborative, forexam-ple, groups30 American Catholicinstitu-tions, with $50bn in assetsundermanage-ment(ofwhich a small fraction isdevotedto impactinvesting). To encourage publicinvolvement, new“retail” impactfundshave been setup, allowingdonorsto buy ashare fora small outlay—say$30.Fornow, the Catholiccapital dedicatedto impactinvestmentstotalsaround only$1bn. Yetsuch are the church’sassetsthat ithasthe potential to transform the size ofthe impact-investmentmarket. Itmightalso, however, transform the church’sﬁ-nancingmodel: from a “sequential” one,where the church ﬁrstacquireswealth andthen givesitaway; to a “parallel” one.Thiscausesanxietyin Catholiccircles.Some worrythatmakingmoneyfrom phi-lanthropycannotbe squared with the ba-sicmoral imperative to care forthe needy.Othersfeara lossofcontactwith the bene-ﬁciariesofCatholicgenerosity. The shiftinstrategyprobablyalso requiresa person-nel shake-up.

Andspread-betting—where punterscan buyorsell a given outcome—allowspunterstohedge theirrisks, which Priomha does formore than 95% ofitstrades.Butscepticsabound. Galileo, a sportshedge fund launched in 2010, folded in2012 afterlosing$2.5m. Criticscontend thatsportstradingmarketsare farlessliquidthan ﬁnancial ones. Adam Kucharski, aLondon-based mathematician, saysthat inonlya fewmarketsare gamblerssafe fromthe riskofplacingbigbetsthatwill movethe oddsagainstthemselves. Amore fundamental problem isthatbookmakersare also spendinglavishly todevelop predictive models; manyhavededicated unitsofquantitative traders. Thehedge funds’ conﬁdence thattheycan con-sistentlybeatthe house seemsmisplaced.The fundsargue, however, thatbook-makerscan be wrong: manylostmoneyonEnglish football when Leicesterwon thePremierLeague in 2016, againstinitial oddsof5000-to-1. Theyalso pointoutthatthelarge numberofcasual betterspunting onbigeventscan skewthe odds. In thosecases, the bookmaker’sinterestmaynot beto forecastthe result, butto minimise itsriskbyattractingbetson a low-probabilityoutcome. And bookmakerssometimesdisagree, which theydo more since the riseof“in-play” betting(on, say, single tennispointsora range ofmatch statistics). Thisoption also enablesa fund managerto ad-justhisinitial exposure overtime. “Youcangetitwrongwithoutblowingup thehouse,” saysMrPoots.

Butitishard to ﬁnd workanywhere else.LastyearGDP in sub-Saharan Africa grewbyjust1.4%. Incomeperperson fell. Butgrowth in itselfisnotthe issue that troublespolicymakersand intriguesacademics: formostofthiscentury,afterall, African economieshave been amongthe fastest-grow-ingin the world. Whathasﬂummoxed observersiswhere thatgrowth comesfrom. In 1954 ArthurLewis, a Nobel prize-winningeconomist, argued thatdevelopmentoccursaslabourshifts froman unproductive “traditional” sector—activitiessuch assubsis-tence farming, orpettytrade—into modern, capitalistactivities. Research byMargaretMcMillan, ofTuftsUniversity, and DaniRodrik, ofHarvard, investigateshowfarAfrica hasfollowed thispattern. Theydistinguish two traditionsofthinkingaboutgrowth. One focuseson raisinglabourproductivitywithin sec-torsofthe economy, byaddingcapital orimprovingskills andtechnology. The otherstressesstructural change, asworkersmove between sectors. The outputofthe average African manu-facturingworkerisﬁve timesthatofhisagricultural counterpart.Move people from farmsto jobsin factoriesorhigh-value ser-vicesand growth will follow. Asa thoughtexperiment, considerchangingthe sectoral distribution ofAfrican workersto matchthatin the advanced economies, holdingeverythingelse con-stant. Productivityin Ethiopia would increase sixfold; in Senegalbya factorofeleven.Thingsare rarelyso simple, however. In the 1990sstructuralchange in sub-Saharan Africa actuallywentinto reverse; itwasadragon growth. In Zambia, forexample, workersreturned totheirﬁelds, asindustriesand minesshutdown. Butin the newmillennium, momentum picked up again. Between 2000 and2010 structural change accounted foralmosthalfofproductivitygrowth in a 19-countrysample. The eﬀectwasespeciallystrong inplaceswith a lotoffarmers, such asEthiopia, Malawi and Tanza-nia. Overall, the proportion ofAfricansemployed in agriculturefell by11percentage points.Thiswasno industrial revolution, however. Forevery tenworkersto laydown theirhoes, onlytwo found theirway into in-dustry. The service sectorabsorbed the rest. Citieslike Nairobi of-fered newjobsforskilled professionalsin technologyand ﬁ-nance. Butmostworkerswere more likelyto be hawkingphonecreditthan designingthe nextapp; sellingsecond-hand clothes,notstitchingnewones. In the oil-soaked citiesofLuanda and La-gos, theymanned construction sitesorwaited on tables fortherich. “There’sbeen structural change,” saysYawAnsuofthe Afri-can Centre forEconomicTransformation, a Ghana-based think-tank, “butnotthe type thatreallyimprovesthe livesofpeople.”In EastAsia both kindsofgrowth have occurred atonce: work-ershave moved into more productive sectors, and productivity inthose sectorshasincreased. So anotherpuzzle isthatin Africancountriesthathave seen large-scale structural change, productiv-ityoutside agriculture hasoften fallen. From 19th-centuryBritain to 21st-centuryVietnam, sustainedgrowth hasbeen builton manufacturing. Factoriescreate lotsoflow-skilled jobs. And, asMrRodrikhasshown, manufacturingproductivityin poorcountriestendsto catch up with the mostad-vanced economies, even in placeswith shoddyinstitutions orbad geography. ButAfrican manufacturinghasstagnated. Itscon-tribution to GDP haschanged little since the late 1970s.Orthodoxremedies, focused on trimmingregulation and im-provinggovernance, have losttheirappeal. So there has been arevival ofinterestin active industrial policies. Ethiopia, wheremanufacturingemploymenthasquintupled thiscentury(from alowbase), isexperimentingwith thisapproach.

The resultisthat Africansare competingnotjustwith low-wage workersin Bangladesh andelsewhere, butwith even lower-wage robots. The developmentpath followed byJapan, the EastAsian tigersand, most spectacu-larly, China—movingfrom agriculture to low-margin labour-in-tensive manufacturingsuch asclothingand toys—maybe fastclosing. Trade patternshave changed, too. Instead ofproducingﬁnished productsin one country, African industriesmust slotinto global supplychains.Structural change isaboutmore than factories. John Page ofthe BrookingsInstitution, an American think-tank, argues fortheimportance of“industrieswithoutsmokestacks”: tradable, pro-ductive sectors, like cutﬂowers, call-centresand tourism. Ugan-da, with itsmountain gorillasand the Nile, ispromoting even itsedible rolexto tourists. Africa can learn from the successes ofoth-erregions, such asEastAsia. Butitwill take a diﬀerent path. 7Always somethingnewAfricans are leaving theirﬁelds, butnotﬂowing into factoriesFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchangeThe EconomistAugust19th201763For daily analysis and debate on science andtechnology, visitEconomist.com/science1TUTHILLPLASTICSGROUP, an injec-tion-mouldingcompanyin Clearwater,Florida, recentlywelcomed a newteammemberto itsfactoryﬂoor. From his ﬁrstdayon the job he performed the repetitivetasksrequired ofhim with dexterity, work-ingcomfortablyalongside longtime em-ployees. Sawyer, the operative concerned,isone ofthe ﬂeetofrobotsnowlabouringin the world’sfactories. Instead ofreplac-ingpeople, however, assome earlierindus-trial robotshave, Sawyerisbuiltto workalongside them. ForSawyerisa collabora-tive robot, also known asa “cobot”.Directinteraction between robots andhumansatworkischangingthe face—orratherthe arms—ofmanufacturing. Suchinteraction also meansthatroboticistsneed to design eﬀective team matesas wellaseﬃcientworkers. Cobotsoperate in arealm where human thoughts, humanmodesofcommunication and humansafetyare paramount. RethinkRobotics, aﬁrm in Boston, had thisin mind when itde-veloped Sawyer, a one-armed cobot, andhistwo-armed colleague, Baxter(both pic-tured above). These robotsare notthe iso-lated movingarmsofan assembly-line’bot. Theyincorporate camerasand touchsensors. And theirmostnoticeable featureisa screen thatdisplaysalmostcartoonlikehuman facial elements.Such facesare notmeantto endear ro-botsto workers(though theydo). They are,ble. In the future, DrRushopes, the robotwill also be able to recognise such a signalwhen it, itself, hasbeen seen bya humanto make a mistake.Askingthe ﬂesh-and-blood membersofa human-cobotteam to wearEEGcapsatworkisprobablya stretch (though Dr Rushopesthat, byprovingthe idea behindthem works, she will stimulate the inven-tion ofsomethinglessintrusive). But thereare otherwaysto bridge the gap betweenhuman and ’bot. Both speech and the rec-ognition offacial expressions—in either di-rection—are options. And several groupsare workingon these.Once a channel ofcommunication hasbeen established, regardlessofwhatit is, itneedsto be used appropriately. Itis impor-tant—asanyone who hashad to deal withthe sociallyineptwill know—thatrobotsunderstand the rightmomentsto conveymessages, and also howmuch informa-tion to convey. Julie Shah, anotherre-searcheratMIT, hasbeen analysingthecostsand beneﬁtsofrobotover- and un-der-communication, and isusingthatin-formation to design algorithmswhich candecide when and whatcommunication isappropriate. When attemptingto convey amessage, a robotmustestimate itsinterloc-utor’sintentionsand whathisresponse islikelyto be. Ifan algorithm calculates thatcommunication will be beneﬁcial, itmustthen convertthe conceptto be conveyedinto somethingunderstandable, whetherthatbe a raised eyebrowora stream of syn-thesised speech. Too much informationmayresultin people ignoringmessagescompletely. One feature ofDrShah’salgo-rithms, therefore, isthattheytryto takeinto accountwhatinformation a humanteam mate alreadypossesses.Cobotsare notentirelynew. BMW, aGerman carcompany, broughtitsﬁrst into rather, intended to promote communica-tion between person and machine. Forex-ample, when a human reachesfora coﬀeecup, he orshe usuallyglancestowards thecup before doingso. Thisisa cue indicatingthe action aboutto be performed. Sawyeremulatesthisby“glancing” in the directionhe isaboutto reach, in advance ofthe mo-tion. Thatpermitspeople to anticipate thecobot’smovements.Smile and waveResearchersatthe MassachusettsInstituteofTechnology(MIT) are nowpushingthisnon-verbal conveyance ofintention be-tween Baxterand hishuman colleagues astep further.

Itsoundslike a child’sriddle.Butthe answermayexplain the fate ofmanysatellitesthathave failed prema-turelyin orbitoverthe years. For theriddle to work, the speckmustbe travel-lingat70km a second, orthereabouts. If itis, the riddle’ssolution isthatboth cangenerate an electromagneticpulse capa-ble ofknockingoutunprotected electron-icequipment.That, atleast, isthe hypothesis nowbeinginvestigated bySigrid Close ofStanford University. DrClose came upwith itin 2010, when she wasshootingsmall particlesatvarioustypesof space-craftmaterial placed inside a vacuumchamberatthe MaxPlanckInstitute inHeidelberg, Germany. These experi-mentssuggested thatwhen a micro-meteoroid, to give such dustitstechnicalname, collideswith a satellite, it will notjustdo a small amountofmechanicaldamage. Iftravellingfastenough, it willalso create a shockwave thatvaporisespartofthe spacecraft’smetallicskin. Thiswill, in turn, create a plasma—agasso energeticthatitsatomshaveparted companywith some oftheirelectrons, thusbecomingions. The plas-ma will then expand from itspointoforigin into the vacuum ofspace. An atombomb similarlycreatesan expandingplasma, albeiton a fargranderscale. And,in both cases, the diﬀerence in velocitywithin the expandingplasma betweenslow-moving(because heavy), positivelycharged ionsand fast-moving(becauselight), negativelycharged electronscreatesan electrical imbalance thatcausesthe emission ofa pulse ofelectro-magneticenergypowerful enough todisable nearbyelectrical equipment.The deﬁnition of“nearby” isdiﬀerentin the two cases, ofcourse. Fora bomb itismanykilometres; fora speckofdustmere centimetres. Buteven thatshortrange, DrClose reckons, isenough to do asatellite seriousharm.Workingoutthe detailsistricky. But,in a paperpublished recentlyin thePhysicsofPlasmas, she and hercollab-orator, AlexFletcherofthe MassachusettsInstitute ofTechnology, use a type ofmodellingcalled particle-in-cell sim-ulation to do so. Thistechnique attemptsto followthe zillionsofparticles in aplasma bytreatinggroupsofthem as“superparticles”. These groupscan behandled, statistically, in a waywhichapesrealitycloselyenough to be usefulwhile remainingsimple enough to beprocessed bya computer. Theirconclu-sion wasthatthe pulse’sradiation willhave a higherfrequencythan wasprevi-ouslybelieved, and thusbe more pow-erful than currentsatellitesare designedto withstand.DrClose and hercolleaguesare nowconductingmore testson the ground, tosee iftheircalculationsare correct. Ifthose calculationsdo stand up, that willhave implicationsforsatellite design.More shieldingofvulnerable partsmaybe needed, which will add to weight, andtherefore to cost. Thatextra costmay beworthwhile, though.

On August8th TomPrice, the secretaryforhealth and humanservicesin America, raised the possibilityofa vaccine to preventaddiction—some-thinghe described itas“an incrediblyex-citingprospect”. Expertshave cautionedthatsuch treatmentsare nowhere near re-ality. Butresearch isgoingon. Astudy pub-lished in thisweek’sNature, forinstance,describesthe search fora vaccine againstfenethylline—a drugparticularlypopularin partsofthe Middle East. Fenethylline isa stimulant, rather thanapainkiller. Itisa combination oftwodrugs, ratherthan beinga pure substance.One componentisamphetamine, itselfawell-known stimulantwith a large blackmarket. The otheristheophylline, which isprescribed forrespiratoryproblemssuchaschronicobstructive pulmonarydisease.Fenethylline wasdeveloped in the 1960s,underthe trade name ofCaptagon, to treathyperactivityin children, though itis nolongerused forthatpurpose.

In SaudiArabia, three quartersofthose treated fordrugproblemsare addicted to amphet-amines, almostall ofthem in the form offenethylline.

Developinganyvaccine meansstimu-latingthe immune system to recognise thethingto be vaccinated against. However,the immune system tendsto recognise,and thusdevelop antibodiesto, onlylargemoleculeslike proteins. Mostdrugsare toosmall foritto notice. Thisiswhysmokersand cocaine usersdo notdevelop immuni-tyto theirhabits. Nicotine and cocaine areinvisible to the immune system. And so areamphetamine and theophylline.Small is notbeautifulOne wayto develop vaccinesagainstsmallmoleculesisto combine versionsofthemwith carrierproteins, to create a complexbigenough to provoke an immune re-sponse. Experience hasshown thathaemocyanin, a protein derived from key-hole limpets, isparticularlyeﬀective forthispurpose, so thatwasthe one the teamchose. Theirhope wasthat, because anti-bodiesare themselveslarge molecules, ifthe immune system could be induced togenerate antibodiesto fenethylline’scom-ponents, the combination ofdrugmole-cule and antibodywould be too large tocrossthe blood-brain barrier. Thisis a sys-tem oftightlyjoined cellsliningblood ves-selsin the brain, which isthere to keep dan-gerousthingsoutofthatorgan.

Theyinjected the rodentswith the variousputative vaccinestheyhad made, then scrutinised them carefully,lookingin particularforunusual levels ofanxietyand strange patternsofmove-ment. Theyalso checked the levelsof drugmoleculesin theiranimals’ bloodstreamsand in theirbrains. Pursuingthisincremental approach en-abled the team to trackthe eﬀectsof diﬀer-entmoleculeson the animals’ activitypat-terns. Theyshowed, forexample, that thetheophylline in fenethylline ampliﬁes theeﬀectofamphetamine. The prize, though,wasthe vaccine raised againstfenethyllineasa whole. When given a dose ofthe drug,mice thathad previouslybeen injectedwith thisvaccine showed a marked reduc-tion, compared with mice thathad notbeen vaccinated, in the sortofincessantmovementfenethylline induces. Also, 30timesasmuch ofthe drugwastrapped intheirbloodstreams, ratherthan enteringtheirbrains. Thatispromising. Though MrPrice’sambition ofa preventive vaccine remainsalongwayoﬀ, thisworkoﬀershope ofonethatcould treatthose alreadyaddicted. Ad-mittedly, previouseﬀortsto make such vac-cinesagainstsmall-molecule drugs, in-cludingmethamphetamine, nicotine,cocaine and morphine, all failed in theend. Butperhapsthingswill be diﬀerentthistime.7TESTOSTERONE isa hormone with areputation. Though both sexesgeneratethe stuﬀ, thatreputation ismacho. Numer-ousexperimentson non-human animalsshowthatboostingtestosterone levelsboostslevelsofaggression. And in mostspecies—humansincluded—malesare themore aggressive sex.Doingexperimentsspeciﬁcallyde-signed to increase aggression in people isethicallyproblematic. Aggression isnot,however, the onlybehavioural traitthatseemsto diﬀerbetween the sexes. General-lyspeaking, malesare also more impulsivethan females. And that, too, maybe linkedwith testosterone levels—a linkthatGide-on Nave atthe UniversityofPennsylvaniaand AmosNadleratWestern University inOntario have recentlybeen exploring.Impulsivenesscan be measured inmanyways. Thatchosen byDrNave andDrNadlerwasmathematical. In the largestexperimentyetconducted on the eﬀect oftestosterone on human behaviour, whichtheyhave justreported in PsychologicalScience, theytested the hormone’sinﬂu-ence on volunteers’ capacityto do mentalarithmetic. Theyconclude that, in thissphere atleast, testosterone encouragesmen to jump to the wrongconclusions.The researchersarranged for243 malecollege studentsto come into theirlabora-tories. These volunteerswere asked to re-move theirshirtsand smothersome gelonto theirchestsand shoulders. The gelsamplestheywere given all looked andsmelled the same, butin only125 casesdidtheycontain testosterone; the other118were hormone-free controls. Asisusual insuch experiments, those handingoutthesamplesdid notknowwhich waswhich.Thatknowledge wasrestricted to the peo-ple who had labelled the samples, whohad had no contactwith the volunteers atanytime. Fourhoursaftereach volunteerhadanointed himself, which wasthe pointwhen anytestosterone he mighthave ab-sorbed would be atpeakconcentration inhisbloodstream, he wasasked a series ofquestions, forwhich small cash prizeswere awarded forthe correctanswers.Three ofthe questionswere designed in awaythatmightencourage an impulsivebutincorrectreply. (Forexample, a bat andaball cost$1.10 in total. The batcosts $1.00more than the ball. Howmuch doestheball cost?*) The others, which involvedaddingup asmanysetsofﬁve two-digitnumbersaspossible within ﬁve minutes,simplyrequired mental arithmetical skillsto be applied accurately. The researcherssuspected thatthosewhose gel-rub had included testosteronewould do worse than the controlson thetrickierquestions, butthatboth groupswould do equallywell on the addingup.And so itproved. Participantswho had notreceived the testosterone rub answered anaverage of2.1ofthe trickyquestionscor-rectly. Those who had been dosed with thehormone managed only1.7. The probabili-tyofthisdiﬀerence happeningbychance islessthan one in 500. In contrast, the twogroups’ scoresforthe straightforwardquestions(10.8 successful additionsin thetime available versus10.9) were statistical-lyidentical. Impulsive answersto mathematicalquestionsare, admittedly, quite a special-ised form ofimpulsiveness. But, having es-tablished the principle, DrNave and Dr Na-dlerhope to extend the scope oftheirresearch. Theywill use biggergroups anddiﬀerenttests. And theywill also try thesame experimentson women, to see iftheirpowersofself-control, too, succumbto testosterone’simpulsive inﬂuence.7Hormones and behaviourImpulse powerAn experimental demonstration oftestosterone’s eﬀecton behaviour...............................................................*The answer is ﬁve cents.

Itwasthe mostpowerful earthquake everrecorded tohave hitJapan, and scientistslaterdeter-mined thatmovementin the same subduc-tion zone caused the “Jogan quake” of869,aswell asrelated activityin 1896 and 1933.Like the recent“GreatEastJapan Earth-quake”, asithasbecome known, thatan-cientearthquake more than a millenniumago generated a monstertsunami in itswake.

Japan’stempestuousseismichistoryhasled itto become especiallyvigilantaboutwhatto do in the eventofan earth-quake. The regulardrillsthathave been developed forJapanese schoolshaveproved remarkablyeﬀective. Ofthe 18,500people who died asa resultofthe earth-quake and tsunami in 2011, only351werechildren. Yeta large portion ofthose per-ished in justone place, the Okawa PrimarySchool. “Ghostsofthe Tsunami” isthestoryofhowthose directlyin charge thatdayfailed to heed the warningslefton thehillsidesbythose earliergenerations, andofhowthe familiesofthe dead studentstive evacuation orderswere given—and fol-lowed. The elderlywere hardesthit. MrLloyd Parrydeftly, even lovingly, tells thestoriesofthose such asTakashi Shimoka-wara, who died aged 104, and whom hehad interviewed in 2008 when the oldman setthe world javelin record fora cen-tenarian. Next-hardest-hitwere those whomaynothave fullyunderstood the instruc-tionsorwho thoughttheycould grab somepreciousobjectathome before ﬂeeing. AyoungAmerican schoolteacherhelped re-unite studentswith theirparentsbeforetryingto getto herﬂat, herfather believes,to call home to letherfamilyknowshe wasall right. Bycontrast, those who strictlyheeded town procedureshad a solidchance ofmakingit. Warningsirenssounded forabout45 minutes, whichshould have given them plentyoftime toreach a place ofsafety. So whathappenedatOkawa PrimarySchool? To begin with, atleast, none ofthe chil-dren orteachersatthe heartofthis storydied orwasinjured bythe earthquake it-self. Itwasthe indecisive reaction to thetsunami warningthatfollowed whichproved fatal. The headmaster, TeruyukiKashiba, wasnotatworkthatafternoon.Hissubsequentabsence fornearlya weekand hisfailure to help search forbodiesand share parents’ distresscame to epito-mise everythingthatwentwrong. Hisdep-uty, Toshiya Ishizaka, and several otherteachersdecided notto evacuate. Ishizakatold parentswho rushed to the school torescue theirchildren thattheywere saferthere, and he also ignored a school busparked on the groundsthatcould havesaved everyone. Instead, he and the otheradultswho were responsible forthe chil-dren’ssafetypondered the meaningoftheemergencymanual’sinstruction to headfor“vacantland nearschool, orpark, etc”.Nothingappeared to match these words, coped when confronted with parents’greatestnightmare: beingunable to protecttheirchildren. By2011Richard Lloyd Parry, the Asiaeditorofthe Times, had experienced manyofthe 17,257 tremorsfeltin Tokyo since heﬁrstsettled there in 1995. In the weeksafterthe 2011earthquake, he travelled manytimesboth to the Fukushima nuclearplantthathad melted down in the aftermath ofthe tsunami, and to the widerdamagezone beyond.

Whatwasdiﬀer-entaboutthe 2011disasterwashowthesurvivorsand the bereaved challenged thereactionsofthe Japanese authorities in themonthsand yearsthatfollowed. OkawaPrimarySchool isfamousnow. Alongwiththe 74 children who died, mostoftheirteachersalso drowned—deathsthatmanyofthe grievingfamiliescame to believewere entirelyavoidable and, in fact, crimi-nal. Five yearslaterthe Sendai DistrictCourtconcurred and delivered “a decisivelegal victory, an unambiguousassignmentofresponsibility” on behalfofthe familiesofthe dead children. Each plaintiﬀwhojoined the suitwould receive roughly¥60m ($575,000) foreach lostchild. The portraitofobfuscatingoﬃcialdomthatMrLloyd Parrypaintshasparallels inthe accounthe wrote in 2011ofthe murderin Tokyo ofLucie Blackman, the youngwoman atthe centre ofhisearlierbook,“People Who EatDarkness”. In both, Japa-nese oﬃcialsmade wild denialsin the faceofaccountable wrongdoing, ignored andhid evidence, hopingthe annoyinginqui-rieswould go away.

Despite an impressive re-covery, MrMcCrum, a British publisherand the formerliteraryeditorofthe Ob-server, haslived eversince “in the shadowofdeath”. The shadowdeepened when, in 2014,afterhe and MsLyall separated, a fall in aLondon streetbroughta psychologicalshift: a sense ofhavingentered life’send-game. Hisnewbook—which takesitstitlefrom Prospero’swordsin “The Tempest”,“Everythird thoughtshall be mygrave”—isan unﬂinchingexploration ofhisownmortalityand thatofotherpeople. It drawson personal experience, the testimony offriends, the worksofgreatwriters, and in-terviewswith expertsin medicine andpsychotherapy, melded togetherin an en-gagingconversational style. “Thought” isthe title’skeyword. MrMcCrum isfascinated byboth the physiol-ogyofthe brain and howhumans—partic-ularlymembersofhisown generation—thinkaboutdying. Baby-boomers, he ar-gues, live in a “fantasyofimmortality”fostered byadvancesin medicine, the cultofthe independentselfand capitalism’semphasison perpetual growth. Asa hos-pice clinician putsit: “Western societyseesdeath asa failure.”Whatpeople dread even more thandeath, however, ismental deteriorationand the lossofidentitythatitbrings. Oldage issupposed to oﬀerthe consolationprize ofwisdom—butifyoulose yourmemory, wisdom vanisheswith it. ForMrMcCrum literature isa preciouscompanion on the journeytowardsoblivi-on. While doctorsmayhelp people post-pone the evil hour, the real battle is a psy-chological one. In a secularage, hebelieves, people need a narrative to ﬁll thevoid leftbyreligion, and greatwriters canhelp people locate themselvesin “a vividbutinconstantrealitythatisimmeasurablymore profound than the temporal con-cernsofthe heroicself”. Noteveryone isreadyto dismissreli-gion, and MrMcCrum concedesthateven“a confused non-believer” like himselfcanlearn from C.S. Lewis’sinterrogation ofGod in “AGriefObserved”. On the subjectofassisted dyinganotherChristian writer,SalleyVickers, makesa particularlyinter-estinginterviewee. MrMcCrum’sbraveryin staringintothe abysscannotbe underestimated; read-inghisbookinevitablybringsmoments ofterror. But“EveryThird Thought” hassomethingpositive to oﬀer, too. The ap-proach ofdeath can reveal extraordinaryreservesofcourage and heighten people’sappreciation ofthe world around them.

These prime-val inhabitantsofthe deep, icywaters ofthe North Atlanticand Arcticoceanscanlive to 400, possiblyeven 500 yearsold, arecigarshaped, and often have worm-likeparasiteson theirluminouseyesthat aresaid to hypnotise theirprey. Theirbodiesare covered with razor-like “skin teeth”and theirmeatcontainsa toxin; peoplewho eatitstartto hallucinate, become in-coherentand staggeraround, becoming“sharkdrunk”.In hisbookofthe same name MortenStroksnes, a Norwegian writer, recalls howhe and hisfriend Hugo Aasjord attemptedto catch one ofthese, the largestspecies ofﬂesh-eatingshark, from a small rubber din-ghyin the Lofoten archipelago. The bookwasa huge successin hishome countrywhen itwaspublished in 2015. The men use the island ofSkrova, oneofNorway’s“small, weather-beaten com-munitiesthatclinglike barnaclesto therockycoast” astheirbase forthe hunt,which takesplace intermittentlyover fourseasons. MrStroksnesbeautifullyde-scribesthe midnightsun, majesticfjordsand moodystretchesofsea, the changinglightand the peaksthatrise up outof thewater, aswell asthe Moskstraumen, a sys-tem ofwhirlpoolslongfeared bysailors.Dayspasswhile theywaitfortheirshark,some when the sun burnsthe “magne-sium-white clouds”, and the world seems“cleansed and ﬁlled with mirrors”, andotherswhen the sea is“blackasinkandpossessed ofrestlessagitation”.Followingthe ﬁshingline with its baitofintestines, kidneys, ﬂylarvae and mag-gotsdown into the deep where daylightcannotreach, MrStroksnesbringsa little-known world to life. He notesthathumansare more familiarwith the surface of theMoon than with the ocean’sdepths, whichcan be reached onlywith rare, specialistsubmersibles. The pitch-blackwaterspar-klesand glowswith extraordinarycrea-tureslike the Dana octopussquid, whichhaslightson each arm, often ﬂashing si-multaneouslywhen itattacks. He imagi-nesthatitspreyfeelsasifitisbeing assault-ed by“huge Christmasornaments”.The mostinterestingaspectofthe bookisMrStroksnes’squestioningofthe wholeshark-catchingenterprise. He cannottell ifhisincreasingobsession isan “idiotic, mur-derous” mission intended to satisfycurios-ityorconfrontfear. In broaderterms, hewondersifmen need to pitthemselvesagainstthe “myth ofthe monsterslumber-ingin the deep” in orderto make them-selvesfeel like predatorsinstead of prey.Perhapsonlythen do theyfeel trulyin con-trol. He isalive to the strangenessof thisurge: sharkskill just10-20 people world-wide each yearwhile humanskill around73m sharks—and yet“we considerthesharkto be the dangerouspredator.”Putting“shark-drunk” man into per-spective asthe real threatto the ocean isone ofthe manythreadsMrStroksneshaspulled togetherin a narrative thattakes inhistoryand philosophy, mythologyandfolklore, from Norway’sﬁshingpastto sci-ence and the cosmos. Ratherthan an ac-countoftwo men tryingto catch a shark, itisreallya homage to the sea and a call toarmsto protectthe ecosystem thathumanstreatso abysmallyyetrelyon so much. Hewantspeople to understand thattheydidnotjustcome from the sea. Theyare stillpartofit—justdropsin the ocean.7Shark-ﬁshingDeep and dark Shark Drunk: The Art of Catching a LargeShark from a Tiny Rubber Dinghy in a BigOcean.By Morten Stroksnes. Translated byTiina Nunnally. Knopf; 320 pages; $26.95.Jonathan Cape; £12.99Really quite vulnerableAward:Lane Greene, who writes the Johnson column,has been given the Journalism Award of the LinguisticSociety of AmericaThe EconomistAugust19th2017 Booksandarts69ONE warm dayin July, PeterStamm washikingwith yourcorrespondenthighin the SwissAlps. Justbelowa peakcalledthe Silberen, he came to a stretch of dirtysnowclingingto the mountain despite thesummerheat. MrStamm wentﬁrst, step-pinggingerly. Halfwayacrosshisleft footbegan to sink, then hisright. Suddenly hiswhole bodyplunged through the surfaceuntil justhishead and shoulderswere vis-ible. Itwasonlywhen he had clamberedoutthathe realised howluckyhe hadbeen: hisfeethad caughton the rocky shaftofa deep sinkhole hidden beneath. “Thatwasso stupid,” he said, shakingthe snowfrom histrousers.He should have known better. This2,300-metre mountain isthe high point ofhisnewnovel, “To the BackofBeyond”(published byGranta in Britain in August,and byOtherPressin America in October).Itishere thathisprotagonist, Thomas, endsup one afternoon asbad weatherblows in,navigatingthe bare limestone karstwhichiscracked all overwith deep crevasses,grikesand runnels—a “labyrinth ofrock”,MrStamm writes, where “even ifheshould ﬁnd a path, he would still be lost.” “To the BackofBeyond” isthe Swissnovelist’ssixth and strangestnovel. MrStamm, shortlisted forthe Man Booker In-ternational prize in 2013, specialisesin fo-cusingon ordinarypeople undergoingmo-mentsofcrisis. Kathrine in “UnformedLandscape” (2001) isa woman in northernNorwaywho discoversherhusband isacompulsive liarand escapesto France. An-dreasin “On a DayLike This” (2006) faces adiagnosisoflungcancerwhich causes himto ﬂee to the village where he grewup. Likethem, Thomasisa wanderer, leavinghiswife and children one eveningand walk-ingoﬀinto the Swisscountryside. Unlikethem, he seemsto have no reason forhisdeparture. MrStamm, alwaysa masterofomission, hasneveromitted more. Asthereadertriesto ﬁll in the motivational gaps,whatcould have been a conventional nov-el ofa failed marriage becomesinstead anunusual existential mystery. “The ﬁrstimage I had ofhim was15yearsago,” MrStamm said earlierthatmorningata café in the valley, the hollowringofcowbellsresoundingfrom the hill-sides. “I justsawthisguywalkingatnightthrough the country, notwantingto beseen byanybody.” He tried to develop it,butmade no progress. Everythingseemedtoo obvious. He did notwanthim to be arefugee ora thief, and the idea ofa manrunningfrom a dysfunctional relationshipbored him. “Thathappensall the time.”Then he read Nathaniel Hawthorne’s“Wakeﬁeld” abouta man who, withoutpremeditation, leaveshiswife. Inspired,MrStamm began to walkthe landscapesouth ofhishome nearZurich, plottingThomas’sjourneyamid real lakes, valleysand mountains. The novel togglesbackand forth between Thomas’spointofviewand thatofhiswife, Astrid, ashe walks andshe dealswith hisdisappearance. Itavoidsthe emotional rupturesofhisearlier booksin favourofan unsettlingstudyofthe fra-gilityofthe bondsthathold two lives to-gether. Theirrelationship began with “a se-quence ofsmall decisions, aimlessinthemselves, partnegligence, partgivingin”. Easycome, easygo.AsMrStamm hiked up the steep path,stoppingoccasionallyto admire the gen-tiansand alpine rosesthatbloomed alongthe track, he remembered hisbeginningsasa writer, which followed briefperiodsasan accountantand an intern ata psychi-atricclinic. AmonghisearliestinﬂuenceswasErnestHemingway, whose storieswere given to him bya teacherwhen hewas17. Notthe bullﬁghting, big-game-shootingHemingway, he adds, buttheHemingwayofshortstorieslike “BigTwo-Hearted River” and “Catin the Rain”, lumi-nouspiecesaboutordinarylife. In 1998 MrStamm published hisﬁrstnovel, “Agnes”, abouta man who writesthe storyofhisrelationship with a youn-gerwoman asitunfolds. Ithassince soldoverhalfa million copies, thanksto beingastaple ofthe German school curriculum. “Ihate the wayyoungauthorslookforthemostextreme story,” MrStamm said. Afterall, mostpeople’slivesaren’tthatdramatic.“Mygoal would be to write aboutthe com-monestpeople in the commonestplace towhom almostnothinghappens.” Criticsare often taken abackbythepowerthe Swisswritermanagesto elicitfrom these characters. Thisispartly due tohispitilessprose, tautlytranslated from theGerman byMichael Hofmann, itssimplic-ityand calmnessaddingto the menace ofhisimages. In “On a DayLike This” he de-scribesAndreashavingsexand lookingdown atthe woman beneath him. “Sheseemed verynaked and vulnerable. An-dreaswasputin mind ofpolice photo-graphsofcrime scenes, pale, lifeless bodiesbythe side ofthe road, in forestsor rushes.” Butthe force ofhisﬁction also comesfrom itslifelike ambivalence and misdirec-tion. Thisappliesabove all to relation-ships. In “Unformed Landscape”, afterleavingherlovelessmarriage Kathrinegoesto Denmark, Parisand Boulogne insearch ofa man she once knew, hoping invain fora sparkofromance. Theymeet atan uglyhotel with mismatched furnitureand visitthe ﬁsh factorywhere he works.When she makesa desultoryattemptat se-duction, he doesn’tcomplimentherbeau-tybutthe beautyofCatherine Deneuve,who happensto be on TV. Needlessto say,the sparkﬁzzlesand she goeshome. “To the BackofBeyond” takesMrStamm’sinterestin ordinarinessto a newlevel. Thomas’sand Astrid’srelationshipseemsneitherexcessivelyhappynorun-happy. There are no bigcrises, justthe mildclaustrophobia ofroutine. MrStamm de-pictsthe relationship through Thomas’sand Astrid’simaginingsand memoriesofeach other, and asthe novel builds, thismixofreverie and realityleavesthe readerunsure howmuch isfactand howmuch isprojection. Ratherthan beingpropelled bypersonal dramas, like hisearlierbooks, thisone isaboutthe evasionsand fantasies ofamarriage showingitsage, which actas akind ofpreservative. Atone pointAstridthinkshowmuch worse itwould be to ﬁndhim than not: “She dreaded the momentwhen he would be facingherand trying toexplain hisactions. Itwasasthough theirrelationship had been frozen atthe mo-mentthree daysago...AslongasThomasstayed away, nothingwould change.” Backin the valley, MrStamm said thathistranslator’sgirlfriend had described thebookashisﬁrstlove story. “I liked that,” hesaid. “Theyreallyare in love.” It’sjustthatin hisall-too-human ﬁction, thatcan alsomean fallingapart.7FictionMountain

Economistcommodity-priceindexThe Economist’smetal-price index hasrisen by 40% since the start of 2016,although it still remains 33% below itspeak a decade ago. A surge in prices overthe past few months has been driven inpart by China’s crackdown on air pollu-tion, as well as by reform of its industrialsector. Aluminium, which makes up overtwo-ﬁfths of our index, has been particu-larly aﬀected. China produces about halfof the world’s supply; last week Shandongprovince ordered the closure of 3.2mtonnes of aluminium-smelting capacity.Prices spiked to over $2,000 a tonne forthe ﬁrst time since 2014. The price ofcopper has also surged, partly as a resultof supply disruptions at mines in In-donesia and Chile.74The EconomistAugust19th2017TO HERfriends, itseemed asifHeatherHeyerwasalwayssoundingoﬀaboutsomething. Whywasthe world so unfair?Whydid one particularkid getbullied onthe school bus? Whycould hergayfriendsnotgetmarried? Whydid Alfred Wilson,herlovelydivision manageratMiller Law,who wascollege-educated and hipster-ele-gant, getfollowed when he wentto thestore, justbecause he wasblack? Why didsome friendshave such bad luckthattheyhad to crash with herformonthsbecausetheyhad nowhere to go? She washappy toletthem. Butshe wondered, and she com-plained. Ifyou’re notoutraged, she posted,you’re notpayingattention. She shed tearsaboutit, too. AFacebookpostora newsitem would setheroﬀ atthecomputer, even atwork. She cried aboutcrueltyand unfairnessand racistinsults,and posted a linkto a video entitled: “IfYou’re Scared ofIslam, Meeta Muslim”.She wasso upsetabouta policeman in FortWorth, Texas, dragginga blackwomanalongthe ground, thatshe called for him tobe ﬁred. The election ofDonald Trumpwasthe worst; itmade herdesperate abouthercountry. She had posted Bernie Sand-ers’spicture on herFacebookpage, hoping. Itwasn’tthatshe wassad bynature. Shewasbubbly, funny, strong-minded and, at32, happywith herself, even ifshe put onweighttoo easily(cigaretteshelped withthat), and even ifherhairhad too muchnatural curl (she’d found productsthatreallyworked to sortthe hairout, untilsome ofherproﬁle pixdrew“Wow!” and“Saaaaaamokin!”). Purple washercolour,anice strongstatement: purple clotheswheneverpossible, and Violetasthe obvi-ousname forhersweetlittle chocolate chi-huahua, all bigearsand bigdarkeyes look-ingwistfullyinto hers. Ratherthan sad, shewastender-hearted. She shed tearsforhappinesstoo, so thatwhen she had beenﬁve yearsatMillerLaw, and LarryMillerhimselftookherto lunch, gave hera bonusand told hershe wasveryimportanttothem, like family, she could onlymanage tosob howgood itwas, and give him a hug. Herswasa tough job in the bankruptcydivision: enteringall the data about eachcase, takingin the documentsand espe-ciallyliaisingwith the clients, so theydidn’tfeel daunted bythe process. Sheknewnothingaboutlawwhen she lefthigh school, butMrWilson told hershewasexactlywhattheyneeded, a “peopleperson” to be on the frontline with a reas-suringsmile. Herotherjob, which she keptgoing, waswaitressingatCaturra on TheCorner, rightbythe main groundsoftheUniversityofVirginia: a chicplace if youhad the quinoa-salmon combo, lessso ifyouordered the Caturra Mess, which wasapile ofpotatoes, ham and cheese withtwo eggsovereasyand hollandaise. On-line commentspraised the friendlyser-vice; she wasoutraged thatnobodytippedanyrestaurantstaﬀenough.AtMillerLaw(“We help youlive yourlife”) she had to deal with clientswho justcouldn’tmake endsmeet, were beingevict-ed, orwere ill: like Steve, who had Parkin-son’sand feltswamped with billsfor hismedication; orFelicia, with sixchildren,MSand nothingto paythe bills. She wouldhold theirhand iftheygotemotional, tellthem itwasgoingto be OK. Then shewould take them through the paperworkand remind them to send in theirdocu-mentson time. Everythinghad to be doneexactlyright. She wentto nightclasses, ontop ofeverythingelse, to tryto get a betterunderstandingofitall. Itmade hersleeplate some mornings, butMrWilson kindlyadjusted hisschedule to ﬁtin with hers. Ifonlythe world could be putsostraight. Like the racism in Charlottesville,which broke outwheneverpeople talkedaboutmovingthe statue ofRobertE. LeeoutofEmancipation Park, astheycalled itnow, and puttingitsomewhere else.(Someone had painted “BlackLivesMat-ter” on the base ofit, and youcould stillread ittwo yearslater, though the city hadtried hard to scrub itoﬀ.) She had beenborn and raised in Ruckersville, north oftown in the hills, which was85% white andhad more rural attitudes. ButCharlottes-ville was19% black, and still one ofher boy-friendshad told herhe didn’tlike herbeingso friendlywith MrWilson (she droppedthatone fast); and still some folkgasped inhorroratthe mere thoughtofmovingthestatue. And then the white racistscamestormingin from all overto defend it. Howcould theythinkthat?She wasnotan activistherself; therewasn’tmuch time to be. She wouldn’thavedreamed of, say, marchingwith Antifa be-hind a bannerreading“The OnlyGoodFascistisa Dead Fascist”. She didn’tmarchwith BlackLivesMatter, either, orwaveLGBTQ ﬂags, though she supported themall. Herwaywasto stand up loudlyforthem, and to askanyone who disagreedwhytheybelieved that? And howcouldtheythinkit? Butthe sheersize ofthe whitenationalistrallyplanned forAugust12thmade herfeel, forthe ﬁrsttime ever, thatshe reallyhad to getoutin the street. Sheand herfriendscould tryto spread a diﬀer-entmessage, thatCharlottesville was aplace oflove. Suddenly, she had to do morethan justargue. More than justcry. 7Puttingthings straightHeatherHeyer, legal assistant, was killed atthe Charlottesville rallyon August 12th,aged 32ObituaryHeather HeyerOur obituary of Dr G.
