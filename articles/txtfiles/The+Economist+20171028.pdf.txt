The West, whichstill seesRussia in post-Sovietterms, sometimesrankshim ashiscountry’smostpowerfulleadersince Stalin. Russians areincreasinglylookingto an earlierperiod ofhistory. Both liberalreformersand conservative traditionalistsin Moscoware talk-ingaboutMrPutin asa 21st-centurytsar.MrPutin hasearned thattitle byliftinghiscountry outofwhatmanyRussianssee asthe chaosin the 1990sand bymak-ingitcountagain in the world. Yetasthe centenary ofthe Octo-berrevolution drawsnear, the uncomfortable thoughthas sur-faced thatMrPutin sharesthe tsars’ weaknesses, too.Although MrPutin worriesaboutthe “colour” revolutionsthatsweptthrough the formerSovietUnion, the greater threatisnotofa massuprising, still lessofa Bolshevikrevival. Itisthat, from spring2018 when MrPutin startswhatisconstitu-tionallyhislastsix-yearterm in oﬃce afteran election thathewill surelywin, speculation will begin aboutwhatcomesnext. And the fearwill growthat, aswith otherRussian rulers,TsarVladimirwill leave turbulence and upheaval in his wake.Firm ruleMrPutin ishardlythe world’sonlyautocrat. Personalised au-thoritarian rule hasspread acrossthe world overthe past15years—often, aswith MrPutin, builton the fragile base ofa ma-nipulated, winner-takes-all democracy. Itisa rebuke to the lib-eral triumphalism which followed the collapse ofthe SovietUnion. Leaderssuch asRecep Tayyip Erdogan ofTurkey (seepage 38), the late Hugo ChávezofVenezuela and even Naren-dra Modi, India’sprime minister, have behaved asifthey en-joya special authorityderived directlyfrom the popular will.In China Xi Jinpingthisweekformalised hisabsolute com-mand ofthe CommunistParty(see page 27). MrPutin’sbrand ofauthoritarianism blazed the trail. ItevokesRussia’simperial history(see page 19), oﬀeringa vividpicture ofhowpowerworksand howitmightgo wrong.Like a tsar, MrPutin surmountsa pyramid ofpatronage.Since he moved againstthe oligarchsin 2001, takingcontrolﬁrstofthe media and then ofthe oil and gasgiants, all accesstopowerand moneyhasbeen through him. These daystheboyarsserve athispleasure, justasthose beneath them serveattheirpleasure and so on all the waydown. He wraps hispowerin legal procedure, buteveryone knowsthatthe prose-cutorsand courtsanswerto him. He enjoysan approval ratingofover80% partlybecause he haspersuaded Russiansthat, asan aide says, “Ifthere isno Putin, there isno Russia.”Like a tsar, too, he hasfaced the question thathas plaguedRussia’srulerssince Peterthe Great—and which acutely con-fronted AlexanderIII and NicholasII in the run-up to the revo-lution. Should Russia modernise byfollowingthe Westernpath towardscivil rightsand representative government, orshould ittryto lockin stabilitybyholdingfastagainst them?MrPutin’sanswerhasbeen to entrustthe economyto liberal-minded technocratsand politicsto formerKGBoﬃcers. Inev-itably, politicshasdominated economicsand Russia is payingthe price. Howeverwell administered duringsanctions and arouble devaluation, the economystill dependstoo heavily onnatural resources. Itcan manage annual GDPgrowth ofonlyaround 2%, a farcryfrom 2000-08, which achieved an oil-ﬁred5-10%. In the longrun, thiswill cramp Russia’sambitions.And like a tsar, MrPutin hasbuttressed hispowerthroughrepression and militaryconﬂict. Athome, in the name ofsta-bility, tradition and the Orthodoxreligion, he hassuppressedpolitical opposition and social liberals, includingfeminists,NGOsand gays. Abroad, hisannexation ofCrimea and thecampaignsin Syria and Ukraine have been burnished for theeveningnewsbya captive, triumphalistmedia. However justi-ﬁed, the West’soutrage athisactionsunderlined to RussianshowMrPutin wasonce again assertingtheircountry’sstrength afterthe humiliationsofthe 1990s. Whatdoesthispost-modern tsarmean forthe world? Onelesson isaboutthe Russian threat. Since the interference in Ukraine, the Westhasworried aboutRussian revanchism else-where, especiallyin the Balticstates. ButMrPutin cannot af-ford large numbersofcasualtieswithoutalso losinglegitima-cy, ashappened to NicholasII in the Russo-Japanese war of1904-05 and in the ﬁrstworld war. Because today’stsarknowshistory, he islikelyto be opportunisticabroad, shadowboxingratherthan riskinga genuine confrontation. The situation athome isdiﬀerent. In histime in powerMrPutin hasshown lit-tle appetite forharsh repression. ButRussia’srecord ofterriblesuﬀeringsuggeststhat, whereasditheringundermines the rul-er’slegitimacy, massrepression can strengthen it—atleast foratime. The Russian people still have somethingto fear.MotherRussia’s oﬀspringThe otherlesson isaboutsuccession. The Octoberrevolutionisjustthe mostextreme recentcase ofpowerin Russia passingfrom rulerto rulerthrough a time oftroubles. MrPutin cannotarrange hissuccession usinghisbloodline orthe CommunistPartyapparatus. Perhapshe will anointa successor. But hewould need someone weakenough forhim to control andstrongenough to see oﬀrivals—an unlikelycombination. Per-hapshe will tryto clingto power, asDengXiaopingdid behindthe scenesashead ofthe China Bridge Association, and MrXimayintend to overtly, havingconspicuouslyavoided namingasuccessorafterthisweek’spartycongress. Yet, even ifMr Pu-tin became the éminence grise ofthe Russian Judo Federation,itwould onlydelaythe fatal moment. Withoutthe mechanismofa real democracyto legitimise someone new, the next rulerislikelyto emerge from a powerstruggle thatcould start to tearRussia apart. In a state with nuclearweapons, thatis alarming.The strongerMrPutin istoday, the harderhe will ﬁnd ittomanage hissuccession. Asthe world triesto live with thatpar-adox, itshould rememberthatnothingissetin stone. Acen-turyago the Bolshevikrevolution wasseen asan endorsementofMarx’sdeterminism. In the event, itproved thatnothing iscertain and thathistoryhasitsown tragicirony. 7Atsaris bornAs the world marks the centenaryofthe Octoberrevolution, Russia is once again underthe rule ofa tsarLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistOctober28th20171DEMOCRATSacrossAfricacheered on September1stwhen Kenya’sSupreme Courtannulled the presidential elec-tion thathad taken place a fewweeksearlier. The courtheldthatthe electoral commissionhad botched the countand thatthe poll should be held again. No rigginghad been proved afterthe incumbent, UhuruKenyatta, won bya handymargin overthe main opposition leader, Raila Odinga. Butthe court arguedrightlythatelectionsare notjustaboutnumbers. “Youonlygetpointsforthe answersifyoushowyourworking,” said Philo-mena Mwilu, the deputychiefjustice. Itwasa landmark in aregion where judgesare often cowed. Ratherthan usingthe judgmentto strengthen democracy inacountrythatdescended into ethnicbloodshed aftera disput-ed election in 2007, the governmentand electoral commissionpressed ahead with a vote due on October26th (afterwe wentto press) thatwill be even lesscredible than thatof August8th.The main opposition leaderhaswithdrawn, the electoral com-mission hassaid itcannotguarantee a properballotandjudgeswere too intimidated to heara plea to postpone theelection. Whateverthe outcome ofthisweek’svote (and thehope isthatitdoesnotturn violent), itisclearwho the loserswill be: Kenya, and democracyin Africa.Kenya’s unfulﬁlled promiseAsthe mostdynamiceconomyin eastAfrica, Kenya should beamodel forthe continent. International monitoringgroupsworked hard to ensure a credible election. The blame for the re-versal ofKenya’sdemocracyfallson manysides(see page 43).Startwith the bad loser. MrOdinga withdrewfrom the raceon October10th. He hasbeen careful notto call forviolence,butnorhashe dispelled the viewthatthe onlywayto preventitwould be to oﬀerhim unreasonable concessions. He hasre-jected seekingfurtherredressin the courts, arguing thatthe cri-sisisa political one and requiresa political solution. MrKenyatta hasbeen more irresponsible still. Parliamenthaspassed lawsto restrictthe powersofthe Independent Elec-toral and BoundariesCommission (IEBC)and the courts. Be-fore the election on August8th, itdeported foreign expertshired bythe opposition to monitorthe electronic-vote count.The governmentarguesthatitisconstitutionallybound topressahead with the vote; postponingitwould be illegal andreward the menacingactionsofMrOdinga’ssupporters. Butin pushingforthe re-run, MrKenyatta’ssupportersap-pearto be doingsome menacingoftheirown. Barelya weekbefore the vote, Roselyn Akombe, an IEBCcommissioner, ﬂedto America sayingherlife wasin danger. Herboss, Wafula Che-bukati, said thatthe commission had degenerated into war-ringfactionsand thatcandidateswere intimidatinghis staﬀ.“Undersuch conditions, itisdiﬃcultto guarantee free, fairandcredible elections,” he said. Given the chaos, the courtswould surelyordera postpone-ment. Butwhen the petition to do justthatwasputbefore theSupreme Court, onlytwo ofthe seven judgesturned up. Onehad an excuse: the nightbefore the hearingMsMwilu’sbody-guard wasshot.Anotherjustice said she had missed her ﬂightto Nairobi. Denied a quorum, the courtcould nothear the case.The worstpartisthatthe crisisisself-defeating. MrKenyattawould probablywin a properelection. Instead thisweek’spyr-rhicvictorywill come atthe price ofhislegitimacy. Forthe sakeofhiscountry, and to assuage hisseethingopponents, heshould promise to run a credible election, perhapsearly nextyear. Ifhe winsfairly, MrKenyatta could yetbecome the proudpresidentofan improvingdemocracy. Rightnow, he is fastleadingthe countrybackto autocracy. 7Kenya’s ﬂawed electionsDemocracydeferredAbad election is even worse than a delayed oneRARELYhassuch an unpopu-larleaderwon a free and fairelection so lopsidedly. Onlyaboutone-third ofJapanesepeople approve ofShinzo Abe,theirprime minister; a whop-ping51% disapprove. Yeton Oc-tober22nd hisLiberal Demo-craticPartyand itscoalition partnerkeptitstwo-thirdsmajorityin the lowerhouse (see page 23). MrAbe’sdecision tocall a snap election, unlike thatofTheresa May, his Britishcounterpart, paid oﬀhandsomely. One reason isthatthe opposition imploded. Amuch-hypednewforce, the PartyofHope, led byTokyo’scharismaticgover-nor, botched itscampaign and ended up with barelyenoughseatsto ﬁll a ramen restaurant. Aleft-wingsplinter group, theConstitutional DemocraticParty, emerged asthe main opposi-tion force with only55 outof465 seats. MrAbe isluckyin hischoice ofchallengers. Playing itsafeButthe otherreason forhistriumph isthatnervousvoterssoughtreassurance. AsMrAbe pointed outbefore the election,Japan facestwo crises: an ageingpopulation and a hostileneighbour, North Korea, thatislobbingmissilesin Japan’sdi-rection and rushingto ﬁtnuclearwarheadsto them. Both cri-Japan’s constitutionAbe’s nextactAbig election victorygives Shinzo Abe a chance to change Japan’s paciﬁstconstitution. He should take it12LeadersThe EconomistOctober28th201712sesare grave and pressing, butthe ﬁrstischronic—slowing orreversingJapan’sdemographicdecline will take decades—andthe second acute. Manyvotersdecided that, even ifthey didnotwarm to him personally, MrAbe wasmore likelythan anyofthe alternativesto keep them safe. PresidentDonald Trumpprobablyhelped him, too, bygivingJapanese votersthe im-pression (stronglydenied) thatAmerica cannotalways be re-lied upon to defend Japan. MrAbe hastaken hiswin asa mandate to pressahead withhislong-standingplan to revise Japan’spaciﬁstconstitution.Thisisa sensible goal. Asitstands, the documentis impossibleto take literally. Imposed on Japan bythe victorious Americansafterthe second world war, itsays, in Article 9, that“the Japa-nese people foreverrenounce...the threatoruse offorce asameansofsettlinginternational disputes.” Forthisreason,“land, sea and airforces, aswell asotherwarpotential, willneverbe maintained.” Formore than seven decadesJapan hasﬂagrantlyviolateditsown constitution bymaintainingland, sea and air forces. Itsmilitarybudgetisthe eighth-largestin the world. Its 300,000troopsare superblyequipped. Successive governmentshaveclungto the ﬁction thatthisissomehowconstitutional byus-ingthe label of“self-defence forces”. Aslegal camouﬂage goes,thisislike tryingto hide a tankbystickinga Post-it note on it. MrAbe isrightto wantto make clearin the constitution thatJapan may, in fact, maintain armed forces. The rule of lawmat-ters, and isundermined when the governmentnakedlydis-obeysitsprinciples. Whatismore, decadesofdouble-talk overArticle 9 have muddled the debate thatJapan oughtto be hav-ingoverwhatrole itshould playin maintainingregional andglobal security. Everytime a Japanese governmenttriesto do more to helpitsallies, orto contribute more to UN peacekeepingoperations,paciﬁstscry“unconstitutional”. Mostofthe time theyare right,and even iftheyare overruled, theyusuallydelaythings. UntillastyearJapan’smilitaryforceswere barred from helping al-lieswho came underattackin itsbackyard. Japan’sUNpeace-keepingforaysare a joke. Itstroopsin Iraq had to be protectedbyAustralian forces, because theywere notallowed to shootbackatmilitantswho attacked theirbase. ThisyearJapaneseUNpeacekeeperspulled outofSouth Sudan afteritwas re-vealed thatthe war-ravaged African countrywas, yes, a bitdangerous. In JulyMrAbe’sdefence ministerhad to resign forallegedlycoveringup thiswell-known fact. ChangingArticle 9 will notbe easy. First, MrAbe must comeup with wordingthatcan gain a two-thirdsmajorityin bothhousesofthe Diet, which meanswinningoverseveral of hismore doveish colleagues. The revision mustthen win a simplemajorityin a referendum, which maybe a struggle. China and North and South Korea will protestloudly ifJa-pan revisesArticle 9, claimingthatthisisa step backtowardsthe Japanese militarism thatdevastated EastAsia in the 1930sand 1940s. Thisisbunk. Like anystate, Japan hasa right to de-fend itself. Asa rich, mature democracy, itshould also be doingitsbitto keep the world safer. With itselderly, shrinking popu-lation and ingrained paciﬁsm, Japan isno threatto anyone.Alas, MrAbe himselfoften createsthe opposite impression.Ifhe wantsconstitutional change and to reduce oppositionabroad, he should stop visitingthe Yasukuni shrine, wherewarcriminalsare worshipped; denounce the atrocities ofthepast; and distance himselffrom hisgrandfather, a post-warprime ministerand colonial administratorwho forced thou-sandsofChinese to workasslaves.

Neverbefore in the OldLady’s323-yearhistoryhasmonetarypolicybeen so looseforso long. Duringthe ﬁnancialcrisisin 2008-09 Britain’sbaserate ofinterestwascutto 0.5%.Afterthe Brexitreferendum of2016 the bankcutbya further0.25 percentage points, in anticipation ofthe slowdown thatmosteconomistsbelieved wasto follow. The bankhasboughtmore than £400bn ($525bn) ofgovernmentbondsunderitsprogramme ofquantitative easing. Atvariouspointsin recentyearsmembersofthe bank’smonetary-policycommittee(MPC) have hinted thatrate riseswere on the cards. But neverhave theyfollowed through. Until now. Inﬂation recentlyhit3%, above the bank’s2% tar-get. In the third quarterof2017 GDP grewby0.4%. Thatsuggeststo some thatthe bank’spost-referendum cutwasunnecessary.So on November2nd, a majorityofthe MPC’snine membersare expected to vote to reverse it. Arise to 0.5% would markthebeginningofBritain’sﬁrsttighteningcycle since 2003. Thereare good argumentsin favourofacting. ButifThe Economisthad a seatatthe table, itwould vote to hold oﬀ.What’s the rush?One reason isthatthe Brexitthreatisnotyetover. Theresa May,the prime minister, wantsa transitional arrangementwhichseeksto preserve the statusquo while a formal deal is thrashedout. Butgettingone maybe harderthan she thinks(see page48). Crunch time isthe European Union’sDecembersummit. Itwould be needlesslyriskyforthe bankto shake up monetarypolicybeforehand. Betterto waituntil January, when itwill beclearerwhetherMrsMay’shopesare well-founded. Anotherreason isthatthe British economyisnotexactlyoverheating. True, consumer-price inﬂation hasexceeded thebank’stargetformonths. Yethigherinﬂation islargely a conse-quence ofsterling’sdepreciation followinglastyear’sreferen-dum. Even ifthe bankdid nothing, inﬂation would be downagain before long, asexchange-rate eﬀectsfaded. Inﬂation hawkspointoutthatthe rate ofGDP growth isabove the economy’spotential and that, at4.3%, unemploy-mentislowbyhistorical standardseven asthe employmentrate isneara historical high. However, though wage growth isedgingup, itremainsabout2% a year, suggestingthateither asurprisingamountofslackremainsin the labourmarket orlowunemploymentdoesnotproduce asmuch inﬂationarypressure asitused to.Some hawksalso argue thathigherinterestrateswill bene-ﬁthouseholdsbydissuadingthem from borrowingimpru-dently. Although households’ balance-sheetslookfairlyhealthyon aggregate, a large numberofBritons, especiallypoorerones, do indeed have high levelsofdebt. However, thebankcan deal with thatmore eﬀectivelyusingmacropruden-tial tools, rulesto reduce ﬁnancial instabilitybyensuring thatlendingisjudicious. And the British economyishighlysensitive to increases ininterestrates(see page 47). Roughly40% ofmortgageshave avariable interestrate, so theyare heavilyinﬂuenced bythebase rate. Even ﬁxed-rate mortgagestypicallyneed frequent re-ﬁnancing. Compare thatwith America, where overeight in tenmortgagesare ﬁxed-rate, generallyfora lotlonger. Manyhouseholds’ ﬁnancesmaybe able to aﬀord higherrates. Butthere isuncertaintyabouthowtheywould react tothe ﬁrstinterest-rate rise in a decade. Even ifthe MPC tried to re-assure Britonsthatmonetarypolicywould remain loose,manymightbehave asifrateswere likelyto rise further. Iftheycutspendingsharply, the economywould suﬀer. The problem facingthe MPC isthat, havingtalked up thepossibilityofrate rises, itsmembershave boxed themselves in.Ifthe bankdoeskeep rateson hold on November2nd, itissureto face criticism forhavinggiven outmixed messages.

And Malaysia, with its rich electronics manufacturing ecosystem, is a key player in their production.Major tech manufacturers from the United States to Korea and Japan are investing billions into the South-East Asian country, which has built one of the world’s top environments for making cutting-edge products. Last year, the electronic components sector saw investments of $873.4m.The semiconductor sector has beneﬁ ted greatly from global demand for mobile devices, cloud computing and data centres, as well as photonics, ﬁ bre optics and LEDs. Local players such as Silterra, Globetronics, Unisem and Inari have contributed to the steady growth of these industries in Malaysia.American chipmaker Intel is one tech powerhouse that has established an extensive base in the country, with more than $5 billion invested over the past four decades. Operating in Malaysia since 1972, the company’s ﬁ rst overseas site is now Intel’s largest assembly and test manufacturing facility. Its all-Malaysian manufacturing workforce produces Intel’s latest products using smart manufacturing techniques. The plant is also home to Malaysia’s largest design and development centre and one of two shared services hubs that support Intel operations globally. “Malaysia’s robust intellectual property protection and transparent investment policies have created a conducive environment for businesses to ﬂ ourish,” says Robin Martin, the managing director of Intel Malaysia. “The availability of a large, skills-based talent pool and well-established utilities, infrastructure and public services is essential to the continuous growth of companies in 16The EconomistOctober28th2017Letters are welcome and should beaddressed to the Editor at The Economist, The Adelphi Building,1-11John Adam Street, London WC2N 6HTE-mail: letters@economist.comMore letters are available at:Economist.com/lettersEstimating oﬀshore wealth“Buried treasure” (October7th)reportson the latestworkbyGabriel Zucman and col-leagueson wealth held inoﬀshore ﬁnancial centres.

Itisnotinvolved in a ruinouswar, asitwasin 1917, and lacksthe pent-upenergyofthattime. Itselitesare more con-solidated around MrPutin than theywerearound NicholasII—atleastfornow. Yetthe outward calm isdeceptive.

The eliteslacka legitimacyoftheirown and make no long-term plans.Everyone knowshoweasilytensionscanﬂare up. Pollstersare registeringa rise in so-cial tension. In the mindsofRussia’selites, revolu-tion ismainlyassociated with the recentuprisingin Ukraine.

Formallytranslated as“state”, the word derivesfrom gosudar, anold word which signiﬁesa monarch ormaster. Amodern state isa setoflaws andformal rules. Gosudarstvo isan extensionofthe tsarasthe ultimate source of orderand authority.MrPutin’sformerKGB colleaguesswore theirallegiance to him asthough hewere the tsar. In 2001Nikolai Patrushev,then head ofthe FSB, the KGB’ssuccessor,described hisservicemen asa newaristoc-racyand men ofthe gosudar.

Everyyearsince 2001MrPutin hasappeared before the nation,miraculouslyrestoringpeople’sfortunesand disbursingfavoursoverthe heads ofhisbureaucrats. He established a directline to the Russian people, usingstate tele-vision stationsto projecthismessage. Inkeepingwith the tradition ofRussian mon-archs, he presented himselfnotasa politi-cian driven byambition butasa “galleyslave” to hispeople. He rarelyappearedwith ortalked abouthiswife. Atsar, saysMrZorin, iswedded to the Russian peopleand nobodycan stand between them.Thisdirectmandate allowed him toconsolidate power, emasculatingalterna-tive political and economicforces, includ-ingoligarchs, the media, regional gover-norsand political parties. Those whorefused to submitto hisauthoritywerebanished orjailed. Whateverthe formalreasonsforsendingMikhail Khodorkov-skyto a Siberian jail, mostRussians be-lieved thathe fell foul ofMrPutin and de-served hispersonal wrath.

The beginningof hissecond term in 2004 wasmarked byan in-auguration which closelyresembled a cor-onation. Konstantin Ernst, head ofChan-nel One, the main state television station,created a royal setting. All MrPutin had todo wasto walkinto it.“Itwaslike stickinga head into a cut-outofa tsar,” saysMrGudkov. The Kremlinguardswere dressed in tsarist-era uni-forms. Theirhorseswere borrowed from aﬁlm studio, havingappeared in a sceneaboutthe coronation ofAlexanderIII. MrPutin walked down to the Kremlin cathe-dralsto the sound ofMikhail Glinka’s“Gloryto the Tsar” and wasblessed bythepatriarch ofthe Russian Orthodoxchurch.The legitimacyofa tsar, however, re-quirescontinual reaﬃrmation. Russianrulers, includingIvan the Terrible, havesometimestested theirauthenticitybytemporarilyplacinga fake tsaron thethrone. MrPutin repeated the experimentin 2008 when he withdrewfrom the presi-dency, puttinga youngerand doggedly loy-al lawyer, DmitryMedvedev, in hisplace.All the while, however, real powerre-mained in the handsofMrPutin, who as-sumed the job ofprime minister. In 2012MrPutin came backto histhrone.Thatyearslidingratings, and protests inMoscowand several otherlarge cities,forced him to reaﬃrm hisstatusbytradi-tional means—and he sawhischance byexpandingRussia’sterritoryduringtheprotestsin Ukraine in 2013 (see chart1). Justaswarin Chechnya helped create him, soconquestin Crimea pushed hisratings upto 86%, givinghim an almostmystical aura. Understandably, revolutionsmaketsarsuncomfortable. Atthe end of2004,justasUkraine’sOrange revolution began,MrPutin expunged the celebration oftheBolshevikrevolution from the Russian cal-endar, replacingitwith a somewhatspuri-ousanniversary: the chasingofthe PolesoutofMoscowduringthe TimesofTrou-bles. While Yeltsin rejected the revolutionbecause itwasthe foundation myth of theCommunistregime which he had defeat-ed, MrPutin turned againstitbecause itseparated two periodsofwhathe sawas acontinuousRussian empire. He wanted topaperovera dramaticbreakingpointin thelongline ofRussian rulersthatled ulti-matelyto hisown reign.Empire buildingYetthe pastisnotso easyto tame.

Itsmainelementwasthe alienation ofthe urbaneducated classfrom a state which refusedto grantitpolitical representation. Con-vinced thatonlyan autocracycould holdthe empire together, NicholasII tried torule a growingand increasinglysophisti-cated societyasthough he were an 18th-centuryabsolute monarch. Economically, the countryprospered.By1914 itwasone ofthe largestand fastest-growingeconomiesin the world, account-ingfor5.3% ofglobal industrial produc-tion—more than Germany. Itranked be-tween Spain and Italyin GDP perperson. Itproduced Malevich and Kandinsky, Proko-ﬁevand Rachmaninov.

Nationalistsand some oftheclergy, includingMrPutin’sconfessor, Fa-therTikhon Shevkunov, claim thatthe Bol-shevikrevolution wasbroughtaboutby aWestern-sponsored intelligentsia, who be-trayed theirtsar. The opposite campblamesthe stupidityofNicholasII and thecorruption ofhiscourt, which fed thesense ofpopularinjustice.The debate isasmuch aboutthe presentasitisaboutthe past. The economicgrowth ofthe 2000s(see chart2 on previ-ouspage) hasalso produced a thriving ur-ban middle classthatisalienated from theKremlin. The challenge oftransformingRussia into a modern state isasacute todayasitwas100 yearsago. The issuesoflegiti-macyand succession ofpowerare onceagain central to Russian politics.Might, notrightMrPutin’srule isan example ofwhatDouglassNorth, an economist, called “alimited-accessorder”. Thisisa state whereeconomicand political resourcesare madeavailable notbythe rule oflawbutby priv-ilegesgranted from above. Politically, itrestson a system thatpredatesand sur-vivesthe Sovietperiod. AsHenryHale, anAmerican political scientist, explains in arecentarticle, these informal networks andpersonal connectionstake precedenceoverformal rulesand institutions. In the1990sthese networksjostled forinﬂuence;in the 2000stheywere integrated into asingle pyramid with MrPutin atthe top asthe chiefpatron.The weaknessofpropertyrightsandthe rule oflaware notaccidental short-comings, butnecessaryelementsofthispersonalised system. The legitimacyofownership oroﬃce can be provided onlybythe patron. The patron-clientrelation-ship cannotbe imposed on a society, butrequiresitsconsent, which in turn dependson the popularityofthe chiefpatron. KirillRogov, a political analyst, arguesthat MrPutin appearsboth asa defenderofhispeople againsta greedyand predatoryelite, and the defenderofthe elite against apossible popularuprising.MrPutin’slegitimacydoesnotextendto hisgovernment, which isseen by80% ofthe population ascorruptand self-serving.Legitimacycannotbe passed from the tsarto the nextgeneration. Thatmakesthequestion ofsuccession the mostcrucialone forRussia’sfuture, and the one thatweighsmostheavilyon the mindsoftheelite. AsFiona Hill, seniordirector attheNational SecurityCouncil, said in a recentessaywritten before she joined the NSC,“The increased preponderance ofpowerinthe Kremlin hascreated greaterriskfor theRussian political system nowthan atanyotherjuncture in recenthistory.” There islittle doubtthatMrPutin willbe reaﬃrmed asRussia’spresidentafterthe election nextspring. Buthisvictorywill onlyintensifythe talkofwhatcomesafterwards. The pointofthe election isnotto provide an alternative to MrPutin, buttoprove thatthere isnone. And yetitis notjusta formality. Although the tsaris notac-countable to anyinstitution, he issensitiveto publicopinion and ratings. These arecloselywatched byopportunisticelites.ItisthisweaknessthatMrNavalny, MrPutin’smain challenger, istryingto exploit.He broughtyoungpeople onto the streetsthissummerand hasbeen campaigningeversince despite the Kremlin barring himfrom standingin electionson the groundsofa criminal conviction ithad engineered.MrNavalnyisnotseekingto beat MrPutin—forthathe would need a fairelec-tion. He wantsto deprive him of“miracle,mysteryand authority”. The Grand Inquis-itorin “The BrothersKaramazov”, FyodorDostoevsky’smasterpiece, identiﬁed theseas“the three powers, three unique forcesupon earth, capable ofconqueringforeverbycharmingthe conscience ofthese weakrebels—men—fortheirown good.”MrNavalnyﬁrstpierced MrPutin’saurain 2012 bybrandinghisrulingUnited Rus-sia partya collection of“crooksandthieves”. Thatdescription spread throughthe country, causingmore damage to theKremlin than actual revelationsofcorrup-tion. Although MrNavalnyfacesreal phys-ical threats, he shunsthe image ofa revolu-tionary, a crusaderora martyr, which onlyelevatesthe tsar; instead, he seeksto bringMrPutin down to hislevel byportrayinghimselfasa professional politician doinghisjob.Recentlyhe described MrPutin not asadespotortyrant, butasa turnip. “Putin’snotoriousratingof86% existsin a politicalvacuum,” he wrote in a blog. “Ifthe onlythingyouhave been fed all yourlife istur-nip, youare likelyto rate itashighly edible.We come to thisvacuum with an obvious[message]: There are betterthingsthan tur-nips.” Laughterand mockerycan erode le-gitimacyfarmore than anyrevelations.WhatMrNavalnyoﬀersisnotjust achange ofpersonalityatthe top oftheKremlin, buta fundamentallydiﬀerent po-litical order—a modern state. HisAmeri-can-style campaign, which includesfre-quentmentionsofhisfamily, breaksthecultural code which MrPutin hasevoked.Hispurpose, he says, isto alleviate the syn-drome of“learned helplessness” and anentrenched beliefthatnothingcan change. Reordering RussiaThe longerMrPutin staysin power, themore likelyhisrule isto be followed bychaos, weaknessand conﬂict. Even hissupportersexpectasmuch. AlexanderDu-gin, a nationalistideologist, saysRussia isenteringa time oftroubles. “Putin worksforthe present. He hasno keyto the fu-ture,” he says. While nobodyknowswhatwill follow, fewpeople in Russia’selite ex-pectthe succession to happen constitu-tionallyorpeacefully. Writingin 1912, Russian artistscould notimagine thatNekto 1917 would turn into aBolshevikrevolution. The Bolshevikswereamere 10,000 people, and even in 1917 no-bodycould believe theywould seize pow-er, letalone hold on to it. Yeteveryonesensed a crisisand corrosion atthe heart ofthe Russian court. In February1917, ﬁvedaysbefore the abdication ofthe tsar, Alex-anderBenois, a noted artist, wrote: “Itseemseverythingmaystill blowover. Onthe otherhand, itisobviousthatthe ab-scesshasripened and mustburst…Whatbastards, orto be more precise, what idiotsare those who broughtthe countryand themonarchyto thiscrisis.” 7When will Russia see the back of Mr Putin?ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTA new study from The Economist Intelligence Unit, sponsored by Franklin Templeton Investments, finds that many institutional investors are reacting to current market conditions with significant shifts in their short-term investment strategies. In Asia-Pacific, 52% of investors say they are increasing their portfolio turnover to find yield, despite the increased risk such action entails. Meanwhile, 45% have reallocated asset classes due to regulations, and four in ten are shortening holding periods.These trends show little sign of reversing in the near future, as Asia-Pacific investors remain focused on market volatility as the number one barrier to lengthening their investment horizon (see chart). However, Asia-Pacific’s institutional investors’ increased willingness to hunt for short-term returns stands in seeming contradiction to  their approach towards their return targets. Only 27% say immediate pressures have prompted them to adopt a short-term approach to setting return targets, while 39% say these pressures have actually made them more focused on long-term objectives. Many of the respondents are insurance companies and pension funds, investors with lengthening liabilities that highlight the difficulty of achieving future targets. For more insights from the research, visit institutionalinvestmenthorizon.eiu.comIn Asia-Pacific’s prolonged low-yield and regulated environment,  institutional investors are increasingly taking on greater portfolio risk in  their search for returns, and the risks are plentiful.

MrAbe nowhasa chance to achieve a long-cherished goal: changingthe paciﬁst lan-guage ofJapan’sconstitution. The LDP took281ofthe 465 seatscon-tested, farbeyond the simple majority thatMrAbe had setashisvictoryline (seechart). Thatmeanshispartyhasa biggershare ofthe total, since the lowerhousehasbeen slimmed byten seats. Komeitodid notdo so well.

The CDP onlyﬁelded 78 candidates, compared with over200 who ran forthe PartyofHope. But ittook55 seatsto win the second-largestshare in the house. The factthatitgainedmore than three timesasmanyseatsas ithad goinginto the electionsisa sign ofvot-ers’ disgruntlementwith MrAbe. Thepartysaysitwantsto preserve Japan’scon-stitutional paciﬁsm and shrinkthe wealthgap thathasgrown underMrAbe’sco-alition government. Butthe CDP isunlikelyto deterMr Abe.Adayafterhisvictorythe prime ministerdescribed revisingthe constitution, whichbarsJapan from actinglike a normal mili-tarypower, asa “main policy”. He wantstochange Article 9 ofthe documentto recog-nise the Self-Defence Forces(SDF), asJa-pan’sarmed servicesare coylycalled, asaproperarmy.

Manyofthose who voted forthe LDPdid so onlybecause offearofchange andrisingtensionson the Korean peninsula.The LDP also beneﬁted from a divided op-position.

Butthe constitu-tion’swordinggivesammunition topoliticianswho objectto puttingJapanesesoldiersin harm’sway. Some countries, in-cludingAmerica, agree with MrAbe that itishigh time thatJapan be freed ofsuch con-straints. Apartfrom China and South Ko-rea, which are still haunted bymemoriesofJapan’sbrutal occupationsoftheir terri-torybefore and duringthe war, fewcoun-triesfeara revival ofJapanese militarism.

Buttinkeringwith Article 9 remainsa political hotpota-to. Anychange mustbe endorsed bya sim-ple majorityin a national referendum. Theoutcome would notbe certain. Picking the momentItisunclearhowquicklyMrAbe will moveon this. He saysthathe wantsthe assent ofall parties—which maybe impossible forthe CDPto give. Some thinkhe maytry tocementhisposition ﬁrstbywinninganoth-erterm asthe LDP’sleaderin elections forthe postthatare due to be held next Sep-tember. There will be local and upper-house electionsin 2019 and in the follow-ingyearTokyo will hostthe Olympicgames. So MrAbe maywell wantto put aconstitutional-revision bill to the Diet bythe end ofnextyear. In otherareas, policywill remain muchthe same. Beyond a pledge to use some ofthe revenue from a planned increase inconsumption taxin October2019 to pro-vide free kindergartens, MrAbe hasnotsaid much abouthowhe will tackle whathe describesasthe otherbigissue facing Ja-pan: an ageingpopulation. An earlypriori-tywill be to push through billsthat wereheld up bythe election, mostnotably oneto change the country’sstressful workingstyle, notleastbyrestrictingovertime. Despite the win, MrAbe will still bevulnerable. Those thinkingofchallenginghim in nextyear’sleadership contestarequietfornow. Butthey, and voters, havenotforgotten a plummetin MrAbe’srat-ingsearlierthisyearafterhe wasreported-lylinked to two scandals—in which he de-niesinvolvement.

KingChulalongkorn, the grandfather ofKingBhumibol, declared over-the-top fu-neralsto be “a waste ofhuman labourandmoney” before hisown death, in 1910. And,to be fair, KingBhumibol’scrematorium isafarcryfrom the 80-metre structuresofthe18th century. Afterthe death ofKing Mong-kut, in 1868, the entire population wasor-dered to shave theirheadsin mourning. Butthe generalswho have run Thai-land since a militarycoup in 2014 arepumpingup the pomp in orderto bolstertheirlegitimacy. The governmenthassetaside 3bn baht($90m) forthe funeral. Theyare lockingup those who make even themildestcriticismsofthe monarchy, such asjokingaboutthe late king’sdog(a sculptureofwhich adornsthe crematorium).

Onlytwo yearsago the world celebratedasa land longcovered bydarknessemerged from brutal armyrule. In a jubilantelection the National League forDemocracy(NLD) sweptnearlyall before it. The party’srevered leader, AungSan SuuKyi, tookoverfrom the same generalswho had impris-oned herorkeptherunderhouse arrestfornearlytwo decades. Hershad been painted asa contestbetween good and evil, inwhich notjustthe people ofMyanmarbutmuch ofthe democrat-icworld felttheyhad a stake. MsSuuKyi’smoral authorityon theglobal stage wasmatched onlybythe Dalai Lama’s. Yetunlike Ti-bet, Myanmarenjoyed a fairy-tale endingwith itsﬁrst properelection—one in which, moreover, itwaspossible foroutsiders tofeel theyhad played a part. Theyincluded Western governmentsthathad keptup the pressure on the generals, campaigning donsfrom the Oxford high tablesatwhich MsSuuKyi in happier dayshad supped, and foreign journalistswho had smuggled liberalreadingmatterto MsSuuKyi duringherbleakestyears.In search oflosttimesWhatto make ofthe countrytoday? In the pasttwo months alone600,000 Muslim Rohingyashave ﬂed theirhomesin Rakhinestate, carryingtalesofbarbarityinto squalid campsacross theborderin Bangladesh; plumesofsmoke markthe villages fromwhich theywere chased. Detail ishard to come by, since the secu-rityforcespreventall buta fewoutsidersfrom visiting the rav-aged areas. Butthisiscertainlyone ofthe biggestrefugee crisesand casesofethniccleansingsince the second world war. Thatisgrim enough, and the complicityofthe armyand po-lice isappalling. Butforthe manydiplomats, aid workers and,yes, foreign journalistsforwhom contactwith the country and itspeople hasbeen a longand beguilinglove aﬀair, there comesafurthershock. In Yangon, the commercial capital, old Burmesefriendswho longshared an open, decentoutlookon almost ev-erytopic, have closed theirmindsto the Rohingyas.Some pin all the blame foreventson a nastygroup, the Ara-kan Rohingya Salvation Army, whose attackon police posts inlate Augustwasthe pretextforthislatestand biggest anti-Rohin-gya pogrom. Butthe group consistsofjusta fewdozen ill-trainedrecruitsradicalised byyears-longpersecution ofthe stateless Ro-hingyas. OtherYangon folkveeralarminglyinto the kind oflan-guage ofconspiracythatenablesgenocide. The “Bengalis”, theysay(noteven gracingthe Rohingyaswith theirown name), arebreedingso fastthattheyare overrunningthe country; besides,theydon’tbelongin Myanmar.Worstofall, ofcourse, isthatMsSuuKyi, the erstwhile cham-pion ofthe oppressed, refusesto condemn the soldiers, the policeand the Buddhistchauvinistsin Rakhine who have been respon-sible forthe rapes, killingsand evictions. On security matters, MsSuuKyi haschosen hawkish advisers—ex-armytypeswith a sus-piciousviewofthe world. She, too, ispricklywhen criticised byforeignerswho once supported her.The Westisstrugglingfora response. Some have called forMsSuuKyi to be stripped ofherNobel peace prize, though whatthatwould accomplish isunclear. Equallydoubtful ishowAmerica’ssecretaryofstate, RexTillerson, intendsto followthrough on hispromise to hold those responsible forthe pogromsaccountable.There istalkofreimposingsanctions. Thatwould hardly helpthose nearthe bottom ofa dirt-poorcountry. Asitis, economictransformation underMsSuuKyi isa second, huge disappoint-ment. Those in charge ofthe economyare themselvesincompe-tents. The ministerforplanningand ﬁnance admitshe has a fakedegree. Non-NLDtechnocratsare notwelcome. MsSuuKyi hasfailed to articulate a programme, and herminionsdo nothingwithouthersay-so. Vital matterspile up on herdeskwhile shemicromanagestrivia.

And the banking system,asone observerputsit, isonlya rumourawayfrom collapse.Then there isa furtherchallenge in the dozensofsimmeringorfrozen conﬂictsbetween otherethnicgroupsand the army,some datingbackseven decades. MsSuuKyi’simperiousnesshasonlyharmed a “peace process” with armed groupsthatshe oncepromised to bringto fruition. Hercomportmentseemsall ofapiece. Cocooned inside Naypyidaw, the weird, emptycapital, the72-year-old isdistracted and outoftouch.Yetto obsessoverMsSuuKyi isto repeata mistake. Forall hermoral force before, and disappointmentnow, she isnotMyan-mar’skey. Itwasalwayswrong, saysThantMyintU, a well-con-nected historian, to believe in a golden age thatthe generals putan end to and thatdemocracywould restore. Myanmar, he ar-gues, isa countrybroken by20 yearsofsanctions, 30 yearsofself-isolation and 50 yearsofauthoritarianism, notto mention morethan a centuryofBritish rule in which the monarchywas rippedfrom the heartofsociety. Descendantsofthe last, exiled kingaregarage mechanicsand rickshaw-driversin southern India. Abroken state, then, with the armystill entrenched in vitalpartsofit. Though MsSuuKyi issincere in wantinga just andpeaceful outcome to the Rohingya tragedy, herfailure to con-demn the armed forcesisdeplorable. Yetforherto blame thearmyoverthe Rohingyaswould be to admitto two parallel gov-ernments. Certainly, huge changesin a fewshortyearsinclude farfreerspeech. Butthe widespread adoption ofcheap Chinesesmartphonesisnotentirelya boon.

Theyform the reshuﬄedinnersanctum ofChinese politics, the Po-litburo StandingCommittee. Foratleastthe nextﬁve years, theywill be the mostpowerful decision-makersin China. Nor-mally, the president’ssuccessorwouldcome from within theirranks. Butthe mostimportantfactabout thenewline-up waswho wasnotthere: therewasno obvioussuccessorto Xi Jinping (toprow, centre), the presidentand partyleader. Moreover, the newline-up wasovershadowed byan eventon the previ-ousday, when the 2,300 delegatesto thecongressapproved a revised version of theparty’sconstitution. Article 2 ofthe docu-mentliststhe party’sguidingprinciples.The congressapproved a newone: “XiJinpingThoughton Socialism with Chi-nese Characteristicsfora NewEra”. Thiswill guide the countryuntil the middle ofthe century. Itsadoption is, in eﬀect,theapotheosisofMrXi.Partyleadershave heaped extravagantpraise on the ill-deﬁned Xi JinpingThoughtsince he introduced the idea (albeitwith-capital Tshould make iteasierto overrideresistance because to go againstMrXiwould be to go againstthe party’scharter.Butitraisesthe riskthatunderlings will tellMrXi onlywhattheythinkhe wantstohear. Thatcould lead to bad decisions.Some will argue thatrevisingthe consti-tution thiswaydoesnotadd much to MrXi’spower. Communistsare supposed totoe the partyline anyway. Denghad noneed ofa Thoughtor, ashe posthumouslyended up with, a Theory, in orderto rule.Havinga Thoughtnamed afterhim mayperhapshelp MrXi in hisbattlesto come,ratherthan signal thathe haswon a war.Atﬁrstglance, the composition of thenewStandingCommittee looksconsistentwith thatinterpretation. Onlyone of theﬁve newmembersisa close allyofMr Xi.Fourofthem are linked with organisationsorfactionsusuallyregarded ashisrivals.And MrXi’sclosestpolitical friend, WangQishan, who served ashischiefgraft-bust-er, hasretired (he is69).Two members, MrLi and WangYang(bottom row, left), a vice-premier, begantheircareersin the CommunistYouthLeague. The league wasonce a route tohigherthingsformanyoﬃcials, includingMrXi’simmediate predecessor, HuJintao.ButMrXi hascalled itarrogantand out oftouch and closed down itsschool. So theinclusion oftwo formeroﬃcialsoftheleagueissurprising. WangYang’sback-ground isespeciallyintriguing. Aspartychiefin Guangdongfrom 2007 to 2012, hewaspartofthe great“cake debate”.

Li Keqiang (top,left), the prime minister, called it“the latestachievementin adaptingMarxism to theChinese context”. Xinhua, a state news-agency, called itChina’s“signature ideolo-gy”. The education ministerpromised itwould be taughtnextyearin schools. Talkoftheoryand -ismssoundsrecon-dite. Butthischange could have bigimpli-cationsbecause itinvestsMrXi with moreauthoritythan anyChinese rulersinceMao Zedong. MrXi isthe ﬁrstliving leaderto be named asa guide forthe partysinceMao died in 1976. DengXiaopingisalso inthe constitution butthiswasan honour ac-corded him afterhisdeath in 1997. MrXi’stwo predecessorsare notnamed in thecharter. On thisreading, no one hasmoreideological cloutthan MrXi. The personhasbecome the party.More yes-menIfso, thiswould make a bigdiﬀerence topolicy. MrXi hasmade inﬂuential enemiessince hisﬁrstterm in oﬃce began in 2012,notablythe alliesand clientsofthe hun-dredsofthousandsofinﬂuential oﬃcialshe haspunished orhad arrested forcor-ruption.

Theyare HanZheng(bottom row, right, on previouspage), recentlythe city’spartychief, andWangHuning(bottom, second from left),MrXi’sspeechwriterwho islargelyre-sponsible notonlyforXi Thought, but alsoforMrJiang’sand MrHu’sideological con-tributions(the “Three Represents” ofMrJiangand MrHu’s“ScientiﬁcDevelop-ment”). WangHuningwill become the pro-paganda chief—the ﬁrstperson to do thatjob who hasstudied in America (Berkeley).The factional background ofone newmember, Zhao Leji (bottom, third fromleft), who will take overashead oftheparty’santi-corruption agency, isun-known. Thatleavesonlyone newmanwho isknown to be closelylinked to Mr Xi.He isLi Zhanshu(top, right) the president’schiefofstaﬀ. MrLi and MrXi metin the1980swhen theywere both county-levelpartychiefsin Hebei province nearBeijing.In 2011, justbefore he became partyleader,MrXi visited Guizhou, a south-westernprovince which wasthen run byMrLi. Thetwo men are thoughtto have grown closeduringthattrip. Atthe highestlevel, therefore, Mr Xiseemsto have given sopsto othergroups.Butthatisnotthe whole story. Over thepastfewyears, the presidenthasbuilt up asystem of“leadingsmall groups”—infor-mal committeesthatlinktogetherthepartyand governmentbureaucracies. Inpractice MrXi exercisesmuch powerthrough these groups, which limitthe au-thorityofthe Politburo StandingCommit-tee. Fournewmembersofthe innersanc-tum are membersofsuch groups. Thatsuggeststheyowe more to MrXi thanmightappear. Here theyall areOne level down, amongthe 18 othermem-bersofthe Politburo, MrXi’salliesand in-ﬂuence are clearlyin evidence. Over halfofthem nowhave tiesto the partyleader,includingtwo newmembers: Cai Qi, thecapital’spartyboss, and Chen Min’er, thepartyleaderofChongqing, both ofwhomhave enjoyed stellarcareersunderMr Xi. The absence from the StandingCom-mittee ofanyobvioussuccessorto Mr Xi isstriking. Aspresidenthe islimited to twoterms, endingin 2023. Hisjob aspartyleaderhasno ﬁxed duration, butaccordingto precedentitshould also end after twoterms, in 2022. Atthiscongress, MrXiwould have been expected to signal achoice ofsomeone to take overfrom him.Such a person would have had to be youngenough to hold the partychiefdom until2032, ie, byconvention, someone born noearlierthan 1960. Butthere isno one whoqualiﬁesin the newline-up. The youngestisMrZhao, the newanti-corruption chief,who wasborn in 1957. Thatdoesnotpreclude MrXi from nam-inga youngersuccessorlaterin histerm.Butfornow, there isno leader-in-waiting.The conclusion mustbe thateven ifMr Xi’srivalsremain inﬂuential in the StandingCommittee, the presidentfeelsempow-ered to ignore precedentwith impunity.The succession system had constrained hispredecessorsbyforcingthem to stick withchoicesmade longbefore theysteppeddown. MrHuand MrJianghad to workwith successorswho had been foisted onthem bypartyelders. Byinsistingon keep-ingthe job open, MrXi hasshown that healone callsthe shots. He maydecide not toretire atall in 2022. With hisname in the constitution, MrXi will be the ﬁnal arbiterwhetherhe hasaformal position ornot, since he—alongwith Marx, Lenin, Mao and Deng—nowde-ﬁneswhatitisto be a Communist. The con-gresshasconsolidated hisauthoritynotjustforﬁve yearsbut, in eﬀect, for life. Xi Thoughtupdatesthe Theoryinvent-ed byDeng, namely“Socialism with Chi-nese Characteristics”. Butitisclearthat MrXi isno Dengist. In 1980 Dengargued thatChina should have a collective leadership,thattoo much powerheld byone personwasbad forthe countryand thatthe partyneeded predictabilityin choosingits lead-ers. Dengwasalso the source ofotherpartynormsthathave been followed formanyyears, such asthose relatingto retire-ment(Politburo memberscannothavetheirﬁve-yeartermsrenewed ifthey are 68orolder) and a foreign-policydictum thatsaysChina should “hide itscapacities, bideitstime and nevertake the lead.”All butone ofthese preceptshave beenthrown out. The exception isthatMrXi re-spected the rule on retirementagesin theStandingCommittee. Butideasaboutcol-lective leadership and predictability in suc-cession are toast. The notion ofhidingone’scapacitieshastaken anotherknock.Acommentarypublished online byPeo-ple’sDaily, the party’sﬂagship newspaper,said MrXi’sthinkingmerited “the atten-tion ofthe entire world”. Xinhua contrast-ed the vigourofMrXi’sideaswith the pro-blemsof“dodderingdemocracies”. So far, however, MrXi hasoﬀered fewcluesasto howhisnextﬁve years(or more)in powerwill diﬀer, ifatall, from hisﬁrstterm. “Government, military, societyandschools, north, south, eastand west—thepartyisthe leaderofall,” MrXi told thecongress.

Politicianson both sidesof theaisle, though theysee eye-to-eye on verylittle, seem to agree thatgiantinternet com-paniessuch asAmazon, FacebookandGoogle maypose a threatto society. “Ifdata isthe newoil, is[Amazon’sJeﬀ] Bezosthe newRockefeller?” asksBruce Mehl-man, a Republican lobbyist, in a reportcalled “Navigatingthe NewGilded Age”,which iscirculatingin Washington.Democrats, longbackersofthe tech sec-tor’sinnovative products, are no longer thealliestheyused to be. When BarackObama waspresidenttechiesgotplumjobsin hisadministration, and the party’ssupposedlysuperiordata analyticsseemed destined to help lockin an emerg-ingDemocraticmajority. Thatwarmth dis-appeared lastNovember. MostDemocratsbelieve Twitter, Google and Facebookhelped puta Republican in the WhiteHouse byboostingdisinformation cam-paigns. Arecentpaperbythe Computa-tional Propaganda ProjectatOxford Uni-versityfound thatTwitter-usersin swingstateswere justaslikelyto come acrossconspiratorial ﬁctionsin the run-up to theGiantﬁrmstend to attractscrutiny.However, unlike otherhuge companies,which create jobsin manystates, internetﬁrmsemployfewerpeople perdollarofmarketvalue and concentrate those jobsmainlyin thrivingtech hubs. Techies’ tre-mendouswealth hasmade iteasyto drawcomparisonsto lastcentury’srobberbar-ons. Consumersmaybeneﬁtfrom theirfree productsand from lowprices, butsmall businesseshave been hurtbythetech giants’ incursionsinto a wide array ofindustries, which can inﬂuence politi-cians. Accordingto one estimate, Amazoncaptureshalfofall dollarsspentonline.Google and Facebookhave captured virtu-allyall the growth in digital advertising.Anti-social networksSo farAmerica’stechlash hasconsisted ofmore rhetoricthan regulation. One excep-tion concernsa proposal to regulate onlinepolitical advertising. Two Democratic sen-ators, AmyKlobucharand MarkWarner,and one Republican, John McCain, recent-lyintroduced the HonestAdsAct, whichaimsto require online political adsto in-clude information aboutwho paid forthem. Political adson television, in printand on the radio mustalreadydo this, butGoogle and Facebookhad successfullylob-bied to be exempted from the requirement. Bringingtransparencyto online politi-cal advertisingissensible, because moremoneywill be spenton internetadsin fu-ture elections. Thisyeardigital advertisingaccountsforaround 35% oftotal advertis-ingspendingin America. Thiswill not rec-tifythe largerproblem, which concerns theease with which Facebook, TwitterandGoogle spread ﬁction masqueradingasnews. Afterthe recentshootingin Las Ve-gas, userswho typed “LasVegasshooting”into YouTube, which isowned byGoogle,were prompted to clickon videosclaiming presidential election astheywere to en-countersomethingthatpassed fornews.Liberal anti-tech sentimentin Washingtonwasstoked in August, when a criticof Goo-gle’sdominance, BarryLynn, wasﬁredfrom the NewAmerica Foundation, athink-tank, supposedlybecause executivesatGoogle, a donor, wanted him gone (NewAmerica deniesthis). Several Democraticsenatorsare rally-ingsupportersbytakingsharp public jabsagainsttech ﬁrms’ dominance. The oddsare “veryhigh” thatthe Democraticnomi-nee forpresidentin 2020 will run on ananti-tech platform, promisingto break upthe bigcompanies, predictsRob Atkinsonofthe Information Technologyand Inno-vation Foundation, a think-tank.Meanwhile, Republicanshave alsoturned more hostile. In the pastthey couldbe counted on to approach regulation withalighttouch, buttoday’spopulistRepubli-cansare notso hands-oﬀ. PresidentDo-nald Trump hassenttweetsbeatingupAmazon and othertech ﬁrms; hisformerchiefstrategist, Stephen Bannon, has sug-gested regulatingGoogle and Facebook asutilities. FoxNewsand otherright-leaningoutletshave begun to criticise tech withthe venom theyonce reserved forHillaryClinton. Tech bosseshave also clashedwith Republicansoverimmigration poli-cy. “Can tech justﬁnd one issue that’ssup-portive ofRepublicans?” lamentsa discon-solate Republican lobbyist.

Thatdoesnotmean theywill. Bigtech companieshave so farresist-ed anylegislation thattreatsthem like me-dia companies, and have taken the mini-mum action necessaryto appearco-operative. Facebookhasfound that Rus-sian entitiesspentaround $100,000 on adsin the election of2016. Butthere isstillmore diggingto do. Congressional leaderswould be wise to demand an exhaustiveauditofall political adson the social net-workin orderto see the extentofRussia’spurchases, saysa top executive ofa largeadvertisingagency, who believesFace-book’sinitial reviewand reportto Con-gresswere cursory. In Europe America’stech giantshavefaced regulation and antitrustaction. TheEuropean Commission levied a €2.4bn($2.7bn) ﬁne on Google forabusingits mo-nopolyposition in online search. IsWash-ington likelyto followEurope’spath? Inspite ofthe heated rhetoricsimilarenforce-mentmeasures, orsweepingnewregula-tions, are several yearsawayatleast. Apartfrom the HonestAdsAct, the onlyotherlegislation thatseemslikelyin the nearterm isa taxcut, which would beneﬁt techﬁrmsbymakingiteasierto repatriate pro-ﬁts, saysBlairLevin, a formeroﬃcial attheFederal CommunicationsCommission.Although there maybe more callstobreakup tech monopolies, there isnot anyreal political appetite to do so. Nor isitclearthat, undercurrentlaw, trustbusters wouldsucceed even iftheytried. The likeliest im-pactwill eventuallybe on the ability oftech ﬁrmsto pursue acquisitionsand merg-ers, although thishasnothappened yet.Amazon’s$13.7bn bid forWhole Foods, agrocer, wasapproved byregulatorswith-outmuch protest. Facebookrecentlyan-nounced thatitwasbuyingTBH, a nascentsocial-pollingﬁrm, foran undisclosedsum. Some pundits, such asBen Thomp-son ofStratechery, a technologyblog, havecalled forthe deal to be blocked, arguingthatsocial-media ﬁrmsshould notbe al-lowed to buyone another. Butitisunlikelythatregulatorsin the Trump administra-tion will take such a view.Perceivingfuture risk, internetﬁrmswantto do all theycan to ﬁghtthe souringmood and win political allies. Theyhavespentaround $50m on lobbyingso farin2017. More than halfofthatcomesfrom Al-phabet(Google’sparentcompany), Ama-zon and Facebookcombined. One oftheirtacticsisto hire notjustmore lobbyists butalso more employees. Amazon hasstartedan advertisingcampaign to marketits jobcreation: ithasplansto hire an additional100,000 people bymid-2018. Butmanyofthese jobswill probablybe automatedeventually. The e-commerce ﬁrm, which isbased in Seattle, hasalso announced that itwill open a second headquartersin NorthAmerica, which would be a boon to anycityitchooses. Around 240 citiesand re-gionshave submitted proposals. WhileAmazon contemplatesitschoice, itis en-joyinga temporaryboostin popularityamongmembersofCongress.Otherﬁrmsare also proposinglocalprojectsasa wayto curryfavourwith poli-ticians. Microsoftishelpingbringhigh-speed internetto rural areas. Google hasrun a programme called Google Fibertoroll outhigh-speed internetlocally, al-though the projectison hold while itsearchesfora newboss. Facebookrecentlysaid itwould spend $1bn to build a datacentre in Virginia. Butthe newdigital econ-omydoesnotcreate manyhuman jobsdi-rectly. Onlyaround 100 Virginianswill beneeded to workatthe data centre once itisbuilt. Denso, a Japanese car-partsmaker,recentlyannounced thatitwould spend$1bn to build a manufacturingplantin Ten-nessee, creatingten timesasmanyjobs asFacebook’sdata centre will. While heavyregulation oftech doesnotseem likelyin the nearterm, politicalwindscan change quicklyand unpredict-ably. Ifa national data breach occurred atFacebook, Google orAmazon, exposingpeople’spersonal information, asrecentlyoccurred with the credit-reportingﬁrmEquifax, there could be a strongpublic out-cryand greaterurgencyto impose regula-tionsto ensure privacy.

Butifa crunch comes, thebigtech companiesmayﬁnd themselveshaunted bytheirbehaviournow. 7JEFFFLAKE, Arizona’sjuniorsenator, isamongthe upperchamber’smore reli-ablyconservative members, asconserva-tism wasonce deﬁned. FreedomWorks, anorganisation thatscoresmemberson theirvotesforlowtaxesand lessregulation,giveshim a 95% lifetime rating, higher thanall butfourothersenators. The National Ri-ﬂe Association endorsed him, asdid theClub forGrowth, a low-taxadvocacygroup. Buthe notonlydeclined to endorsePresidentDonald Trump lastyear, hewrote a bookcondemningMrTrump’sin-ﬂuence on conservatism. Forsomeone asindiﬀerentto policyand demandingofpersonal loyaltyasMrTrump, thatprovedunacceptable. The presidentrepeatedlylambasted MrFlake and praised KelliWard, hishighest-proﬁle primarychalleng-er, whom Stephen Bannon, MrTrump’sformerchiefstrategist, hasendorsed. Thataugured a bruisingcampaign thatMrFlakedecided wasbestavoided.In an emotional speech on October24th, he announced hisretirementattheend ofhisterm. “We mustneverregard asnormal the regularand casual undermin-ingofourdemocraticnormsand ideals,”he said, or“acceptthe dailysunderingofourcountry”. He admitted thata pro-trade,pro-immigration conservative like himhad “a narrowerand narrowerpath tonomination”. He promised to spend hisre-maining14 monthsin oﬃce “unafraid tostand up and speakoutasifourcountrydependson it. Because itdoes.” MrFlake isthe second conservativeanti-Trump senatorto announce hisretire-ment. Bob Corker, who chairsthe SenateForeign RelationsCommittee, also de-clined to seekre-election.

BUSH, the formerpresident,earned headlineswith a recentspeechthat—while itdid notname PresidentDo-nald Trump—unmistakablyrebuked hisRepublican successorfordegradingAmeri-ca’snational discourse with divisivenessand even “casual cruelty”. Yethisweighti-estwordscame momentslater, when MrBush urged America to secure both its elec-toral infrastructure and democraticsystemagainstsubversion byforeign powers. Thistime he named names. “Accordingto ourintelligence services, the Russian govern-menthasmade a projectofturningAmeri-cansagainsteach other,” the 43rd presidentsaid. He added thatforeign aggressions—includingcyber-attacks, the spreading ofdisinformation via social media orﬁnan-cial inﬂuence—“should notbe down-played ortolerated”.Almosta yearafterhisvictory, and de-spite numerousrevelationsofRussian-funded attemptsto stoke racial, religiousand ethnicconﬂictsduringthe 2016 elec-tion, downplayingthe attacksremains MrTrump’sdefaultresponse. In discussionsofRussian misconduct, the presidentseesabid byDemocrats, the “fake media”andotherperceived enemiesto undermine thelegitimacyofhisvictory. AsSenator Lind-seyGraham ofSouth Carolina, a Republi-can foreign-policyhawk, told NBC, theTrump administration has“a blind spotonRussia I still can’tﬁgure out”.Congressisrunningthree separate Rus-sia-related investigations, all ofwhich aresupposed to answerMrGraham’sques-tion. None lookslikelyto do getto the bot-tom ofit. Small wonder, then, thatthoseAmericansanxiousto knowmore aboutwho attacked theirpolitical system lastyear, and whatcould be done to prevent arepeat, pin such hopeson a probe led byRobertMueller, who wasappointed spe-cial counsel in May2017 with a broad remitto investigate whetherRussianstried toswingthe election, and whetheranyone inAmerica tried to help them.Ardentbelieversin MrMueller, a craggyfaced formerFBIbossunderRepublicanand Democraticpresidents, hope fora daywhen the super-prosecutorsweepsasidethe tanglesofpartisan claimsand counter-claimsand layscriminal chargesagainstthose guiltyofaidingand abettingRussia.Such folkimagine a momentwith the satis-fyingﬁnalityofa Hollywood G-man burst-inginto a maﬁa hideout.

Whattheycould gain from this, otherthan dis-tractingthe publicfrom RobertMueller’songoinginvestigation, isunclear.Also on October24th Devin Nunes,who headsthe House Intelligence Com-mittee, said hiscommittee would open ajointinvestigation with MrGowdyintothe 2010 sale ofan American uraniumﬁrm to a Russian company. The deal gaveRussia control over20% ofAmericanuranium-production capacity. BecauseAmerica considersuranium a strategicasset, multiple federal agencies—in-cludingthe State Department, which MrsClinton then headed—had to approve thedeal. In 2015 the NewYorkTimesreportedthatseveral men linked to the newﬁrmmade large donationsto the ClintonFoundation.

Thatwill help free upfundsforagenciesto treatthe problem. Aspartofthiseﬀort, researcherswill tryto de-termine when the opioid epidemicwillpeak, and howmanymore people are like-lyto die before itfades. The answer to thatsecond question can varybyhalfa milliondeathsoverthe nextdecade.The epidemicappearsto be gatheringpace. Ofthe 65,000 drug-overdose victimsin the 12 monthsto March 2017, 80% diedfrom opioids(coroners’ reportsmayunder-countthatﬁgure). The death toll now ex-ceedsthe heightofthe AIDSepidemicin1995.

Unabated, a continuation ofthattrendwould see annual opioid deathsrising to90,000 bythe middle ofthe nextdecade. Thatanalysismaybe too simplistic. MrBurke’sforecastis“plausible ifnothingchanges”, butitis“insane ifitactually hap-pens”, accordingto Michael Barnett, a pro-fessorofhealth policyand management atHarvard University. Amore nuanced mod-el would tryto capture the factthat theopioid epidemicisnota singularevent butasetofintertwined onestakingplace indiﬀerentplaces. MrBarnettforecasts thatthe epidemicwill gatherpace forsometime yet, before stabilisingatabout 45,000deathsperyearby2025. There isgood reason to be pessimisticasthe epidemicentersa newand deadlierphase. While deathsfrom prescriptionopioidsare reachinga plateau, deaths fromfentanyl—an illegal drugwith 50 timesthepotencyofheroin—have risen 92% overthepastyearto 22,000 in March (see chart1).Brandon Marshall, a professorofepidemi-ologyatBrown University, worriesthatthisrise demonstratesthe diﬃculty ofpre-ventingaddiction. MrMarshall’sworst-case scenario forecaststhatopioid deathswill rise to 100,000 a yearby2025. Hismid-dlingscenario isstill dire: itexpects deathsto increase byhalf, to 52,000 by2019, be-fore fallingslowly. Epidemiologistsare franticallyscram-blingto go beyond simple best-guessesti-matesto dynamicmodelsthatcan forecastaddiction and overdosesmore accurately.The CentresforDisease Control and Pre-vention (CDC) hopesthatin time itcan de-velop an earlywarningsystem, usingnov-el data inputs, thatwill be able to identifyopioid outbreaksbefore theybecomedeadly. The CDCdisbursed some moneyto 20 stateslastmonth to improve theirdata collection on overdoses.Areliable earlywarningsystem is stillsome wayoﬀ. MrBurke bemoansthe factthatfewpeople are modellingthe opioidepidemic, whereasinfectiousdiseasessuch asZika have a small armyofepidemi-ologistsworkingon them. Universitylabsare onlynowdivertingbrain powerawayfrom infectiousdiseasesto tackle opioids.One such model, underdevelopmentatthe PublicHealth DynamicsLab in Pitts-burgh, matchesdata in the national drug-use surveyto outcomesin mortality. It pre-dictsthatprescription opioid deaths willrise slowlyto about20,000 a yearwithinthe nextﬁve years, butreckonsheroin andfentanyl deathswill increase markedly to72,000 peryearby2025 (see chart2). Thatisnotinevitable. Butworking outhowbestto preventitwill be hard. Statelegislatureshave enacted over400 billsre-lated to the opioid crisissince 2010.

Around4,000 low-level felonsmade up 30% oftheforestﬁreﬁghtersbattlingthe raging ﬂames,carryingchainsawsand otherheavyequipment. Some risked theirlives. LastyearShawna Lynn Jones, a 22-year-oldwho had lessthan two monthsofherthree-yearsentence left, died while ﬁght-inga ﬁre. Byall accounts, MsJones tookgreatpride in herwork, forwhich she waspaid lessthan $2 an hour, and would haveliked to continue ﬁreﬁghtingonce released.YetCalifornia, like manyotherstates,makesitvirtuallyimpossible forformerprisonersto geta ﬁreﬁghter’slicence. Thestate requiresnearlyall ﬁreﬁghters to becertiﬁed asan emergencymedical techni-cian (EMT), an approval usuallydenied toconvicted felons. Thatiswhyonlya hand-ful offormerprisonersmanaged to get ajob with Cal Fire (the California Depart-mentofForestryand Fire Protection), ex-plains Katherine Katcher, founderofRoot&Rebound, a California-based charityhelpingprisonersto re-entersociety aftertheycomplete theirsentences. Around30% ofall jobsin California require a li-cence, compared with a national averageofone-quarter. The state’s200-odd licens-ingboardshave lotsofdiscretion overwhetherformerprisonerscan obtain occu-pational licences. Manylicenceshave a“good moral characterprovision”, whichimmediatelydisqualiﬁesanyone with afelonyconviction. California’srulesare actuallyrelativelybenign compared with some states. TheNational EmploymentLawProjectgradedthe licensinglawsofthe 39 statesand theDistrictofColumbia which restrictthescope oflicensingboardsto consider crimi-nal records. Itfound thatMinnesota’slawswere the leastpunitive, California’sneed-ed improvement, and 28 stateshad mini-mal orunsatisfactorylaws. In Oklahoma,which hasthe highestincarceration rate inthe country, state licensingboardscom-pletelybanned convicted felonsfrom al-most40 professionsrangingfrom asbes-tos-abatementcontractorto embalmer,and from landscape architectand podia-tristto wrecker, a job which usually entailsremovingdebrisfrom buildingsites.Such requirementsare correlated withahigherrate ofreoﬀending, saysJarrettSkorup atthe MackinacCentre forPublicPolicyin Michigan. Around 4m Michigan-dershave a criminal record, which makesitdiﬃcultorimpossible forthem to ﬁndworkin the 150 professionsthatban con-victed felons.

Hardlyanyofthe soldiersLexington spoke to, dur-ingseveral tripsto Iraq, believed thatto be the case. TheirIraqi en-emieswere ﬁghtinga defensive war, nottryingto launch oneagainstAmerica. Yetthe soldiersaccepted the sentiment un-blushingly. No soldierexpectsthe beloved chumpsbackhome tounderstand whathe getsup to. He justneedsto feel appreciated.Thisparadoxical tendencyamongsoldiers, to hungerfor theapproval ofcivilianswhose viewstheyotherwise setlittle storeby, came to mind duringchiefofstaﬀJohn Kelly’srecentpresenta-tion in the White House brieﬁngroom. The retired marine gen-eral’sboss, PresidentDonald Trump, had gothimselfinto hotwa-terafteritemerged thathe had notwritten to the grievingrelativesoffoursoldierskilled in Niger, an oversight he madeworse, characteristically, byfalselysuggestinghispredecessorshadn’tcontacted Gold Starfamiliesmuch either. Worse still, in acall to the grievingwidowofSergeantLa David Johnson, whichwasoverheard and described bya familyfriend, Frederica Wil-son, who isa Democraticcongresswoman, the presidentcrudelysuggested herdead husband “knewwhathe signed up for”.In response, MrKellysoughtto delegitimise the president’scritics, byimplyingthat, astheyhad little directexperience ofmil-itaryaﬀairs, includingthe “selﬂessdevotion thatbringsa man orwoman to die on the battleﬁeld”, theyshould notpasscommenton them. Indeed, MrKellywentfurther, suggesting, to a group ofawestruckjournalists, thattheywere notmerelyincompetent topassjudgmenton militaryaﬀairs, butunworthyofdoing so. “Wedon’tlookdown upon those ofyouwho haven’tserved,” he saidashe leftthe podium. “We’re a little bitsorrybecause you’ll haveneverexperienced the wonderful joyyougetin yourheart whenyoudo the kind ofthingsourservicemen and women do—not foranyotherreason than theylove thiscountry.” Settingaside, forthe moment, thatthiswasa spurious defenceofthe president’sslanderofhispredecessorsand hiscarelessnesstowardsMrsJohnson, MrKellypointed to an importanttruth.The gulfbetween America’sarmed forcesand itscivilianshasneverbeen greater. In 1990, 40% ofyoungAmericanshad a mili-taryveteran fora parent; in 2014 only16% did. Butthisdissonancehasnot, asthe general implied, caused Americansto underappre-ciate the forces. To the contrary, ithasencouraged, as hisremarksalso indicated, a highlyromanticised viewofmilitaryservice,which isinaccurate and counter-productive atbest.Membersofthe armed forcesare often patriotic. Butmany seetheirservice primarilyasa wayto make a living, asthe soaringcostofrecruitingand retainingthem indicates. Personnel costshave risen byover50% in real termssince 2001. Acknowledgingthistruth takesnothingfrom theirprofessionalism and valour,which yourcolumnisthaswitnessed atclose quarters. Nor isitdisrespectful to fallen heroessuch asMrJohnson to dig a littledeeperinto theirmotivations. When the bulletsﬂy, it istrue, mostsoldiersreallyare motivated more bya great, self-denying senseoflove than bymoney. Yetthatmomentousand inspiring emo-tion isprimarilyaimed atthe comradesﬁghtingeither side ofthem, notthe ﬂag.Meanwhile there are coststo America’suncritical soldierwor-ship. Mostobviously, itgivesthe DepartmentofDefence an out-size advantage in the battle forresourceswith civilian agencies.Today’scutsto the State Department, whose oﬃcersare notno-ticeablylesspatrioticorpublic-spirited than America’ssoldiers,are a dismal case in point. The phenomenon also providesan easyopeningforpoliticalopportunists, such asMrTrump. Hiseagernessto hire former topbrass—includingJamesMattis, H.R. McMasterand MarkInch, aretired armygeneral who wasrecentlyappointed to run the Bu-reauofPrisons, aswell asMrKelly—wason one level a cynical bidto appropriate theirhallowed reputation. And itisworking.Where earliersoldier-politicians, includingGeorge Marshall andColin Powell, were viewed aspolitical ﬁgures, MrTrump’sgener-alsare widelyconsidered to be above the political fray, includingbythe president’scritics, who lookto them to moderate an errantcommander-in-chief. Perhapstheydo. Butitisunwise to subjectsuch powerful men to so little criticism, asMrKelly’sill-judged in-tervention illustrates. On the one hand, the formermarine im-plied thathe, too, through the awfulnessofhisexperience, asacommanderwho had sentmen to theirdeaths, and asthe fatherofa soldierkilled in Afghanistan, wasunimpeachable by jour-nalists. On the other, hisremarks, includinga harsh, erroneous at-tackon MrsWilson, were highlypartisan and contestable.Those lovelymen in uniformAless-noted problem isthatAmerica’sunthinkingreverence foritsﬁghtersisforestallinga badlyneeded reappraisal ofhowitor-ganisesitsforces, and to whatend. The factis, America’sforeign-policydoctrinesenvisage a degree ofglobal dominance, basedon militarymight, which itsvolunteerforce isnowtoo small toenforce. And to increase the force suﬃciently, on current trends,appearsunaﬀordable orimpossible. “Thisforce cannotcarryoutthatforeign policy,” concludesAndrewBacevich, a historian andformerarmyoﬃcer, who happensalso to be a Gold Star father.Thisconstitutesa loomingcrisis, which could logically end inone oftwo ways. EitherAmerica will have to reintroduce con-scription. Oritmustcurtail itsmilitaryambitions. Neither out-come ispalatable to American policymakers, however, so theproblem isseldom discussed. Maintainingthe happydelusionthatAmerica’sforcesare ideal and irreproachable makesthat eas-ier. Butrealitycannotbe deferred indeﬁnitely. 7SemperﬁdelisJohn Kelly’s ill-judged tirade reﬂects America’s problematiclove aﬀairwith uniformed men LexingtonThe EconomistOctober28th2017351AMID the shinyskyscrapersand hipstercafésofcentral Mexico City, the legis-lative oﬃcesofArmando RíosPiter, a cen-tre-leftsenatorfrom the poor, rural state ofGuerrero, oﬀera salutaryshock.

Some 1mMexicansfrom Guerrero live in the UnitedStates, he says; theytell him they“feelfrightened” byrumoursofloomingimmi-gration raidsand deportations. In a countrywhose leadershave inter-mittentlyresorted to anti-Americanism toprop up autocraticrule orjustifyprotec-tionistpolicies, modernisershave long la-boured to overcome distrustofthe UnitedStates.

The relationship hasre-Trump isnotmerelydrivinga hard bar-gain, butwantshisvotersto see his coun-trywin and Mexico humiliated in a zero-sum contest. RobertLighthizer, the UnitedStatesTrade Representative, scolded Cana-da and Mexico fortheir“resistance” toAmerican demandsin the mostrecentround ofNAFTAtalks. When told thatrad-ical changesmightundermine conﬁdence,MrLighthizeranswered coldly: “Whyisit agood policyforthe United Statesgovern-mentto encourage investmentin Mexico?” Shrewd Mexicans, seeinga crisisthattheircountrycannotsolve alone, are re-cruitingalliesnorth ofthe borderto arguethatthe United Statesbeneﬁtsgreatly fromco-operation with Mexico. MrRíosPiter,forone, thinkshard aboutpublicopinionin American farm stateslike Iowa, NorthDakota and Nebraska. Earlierthisyear hewrote a bill proposinga cap on purchasesofyellowcorn from the United States, andurgingthe governmentto replace themwith importsfrom Brazil, Canada orAr-gentina. Though the bill wasmore a sym-bolicwarningthan the ﬁrstshotin a tradewar, itjangled nervesin Washington andin farm-state capitals. Itwasmeantto.To MrRíosPiter, who supportsfreetrade, MrTrump wasexploiting“a gapﬁlled with ignorance”. American farmersexport$2.6bn worth ofcorn a yearto Mexi-co, mostlyascattle feed (Mexican cuisinerelieson largelyhome-grown white corn).Butbecause farmerssell to intermediaries,MrRíosPiterthinksthatmanyAmericanslivingin conservative statesthatvoted forMrTrump “did nothave a clearidea” oftheimportance ofthe Mexican market. In a speech thisyearin Washington,DC, Ricardo Anaya, the young, ambitiousleaderofMexico’sconservative NationalAction Party(PAN), noted thatthe value oftwo-waytrade hasgrown sixfold underNAFTA. Awonkish sort, he spreadsout mained prickly, and unequal. Butsince thedaysofJohn F. Kennedy, both countrieshave believed thatbuildingan open,prosperous, democraticand stable Mexicowasin theirmutual interest. NAFTAargu-ablyhastened the end ofone-partyrule inMexico, and hasanchored everythingfrom electoral reformsto central-bank in-dependence.All thisnowseemsuncertain. Mexicansare confronted with an American presi-dentwho gave campaign speechesaboutMexican migrantsmurdering“beautiful”American girls, attacked NAFTAasa job-killingdisasterand made fantastical prom-isesto build a borderwall thatMexicowould payfor. Asdamagingly, MrTrump’sattackson the media and praise forauto-craticleadersmake itsound quaintfordemocraticpoliticiansin Mexico to defendafree pressand human rights, orto call forthe countryto open to the world.Team Trump hasproposed revisions toNAFTAthatneitherMexico norCanadacould accept, such asa call to review thepacteveryﬁve years, a move thatwouldwreckinvestorconﬁdence.

MsZavala wantsMexico to think“creatively”,lobbyingborder-state governorsto standup to MrTrump and citymayorsto shieldMexicansfrom deportation.FordecadesMexico’sgovernmenthasworked to preventdisputesin one ﬁeld,such astrade, from contaminatingother ar-easofco-operation, such assecurity andintelligence-sharing. Nowthatstrategy hasbeen turned on itshead. All the talk isoflinkage and leverage, to give the transac-tional MrTrump a taste ofhisown medi-cine. Alas, saysAlejandro Hope, a formerintelligence oﬃcer, such an approach car-riesrisks.

Not “SEVENratseliminated,” began onevoice message in a WhatsApp chatin El Salvador. “Whatjoy!” In a countryravaged bygangs, such exchangesmightbe expected amonghitmen. Instead thisdiscussion wasamongpolicemen. Ac-cordingto revelationsin Augustby Re-vista Factum, a website, theygloated overkillinggangmembers, shared tipson tam-peringwith crime scenesand posted vid-eosofdetaineesbeingtortured.El Salvadorhasthe world’shighestmurderrate, and itspolicemen kill withworryingfrequency. The factthatpolicekill people so often in countrieswrackedbyviolence maystand to reason: themore armed criminalsthatoﬃcerscon-front, the more theywill need to open ﬁre.Butsomethingparticularlyalarming istakingplace. AstudybyIgnacio Cano, aBrazilian criminologist, found that thehighera country’smurderrate, the greaterthe overall share ofkillingscommitted bycops(see chart). Itseemsthatpolice un-able to quell violence maylose their inhi-bitionsabouttakingpartin it.Latin American and Caribbean coun-triesalongdrug-traﬃckingroutes leadworld rankingsforboth typesofkilling.MrCano’sstudyfound that17% ofEl Sal-vador’sfatal shootingsin 2015 were com-mitted bypolice. Jamaica’sratio in 2014was13%. Those proportionsare higherthan the 10% rate in the United States,where police brutalityisa heated politicalissue, and dwarfGermany’s4%.In theory, these high ratiosmight stemfrom Latin American copsfacingfrequentdangerousencounters. Butthe data donotsupportthisexplanation. In MrCano’sview, a ratio ofpeople killed bypolice to police oﬃcerskilled by suspectshigherthan 10:1impliesa misuse offorce.In 2016 El Salvador’sﬁgure was59:1—meaningsome “shoot-outs” were proba-blyassassinationsbypolice.Moreover, oﬃcial statisticsmay under-state the problem. Governmentsonlytallykillingscommitted bypolice in the line ofduty. These alone can add up. Venezuelaacknowledgeshundredsofdeathsatthehandsofoﬃcerson “People’sLiberationand Protection Operations”. However, incountrieswhere organised-crime groupshave inﬁltrated state securityforces, oﬀ-dutycopsoften do the dirtyworkfor vigi-lantesorgangs. Oﬃcial ledgersdo not re-cord such murdersaskillingsbypolice.One explanation forthe prevalence oftrigger-happycopsisthe embrace ofpuni-tive policingasan antidote forweak justicesystems. Asrecentlyas2013, police in El Sal-vadorkilled just39 people. Butin 2015, thegovernmentreinstated a mano dura(“iron-ﬁst”) approach, warninggangmembersthatoﬃcerscould shootthem “withoutanyfearofsuﬀeringconsequences”. Policekilled 591people the nextyear.There islittle evidence thatmano duraworks. In Central America’s“northern tri-angle” (El Salvador, Guatemala and Hon-duras), such policieshave failed to stemrisingmurderrates. Theycan be counter-productive: aspolice brutalitygrows, ci-viliansstop oﬀeringtipsorseeking pro-tection from theauthorities. Thatmakesthe publicmore vulnerable. In a recentpoll forthe AtlanticCouncil, a think-tank,77% ofrespondentsin the northern trian-gle said theydid nottrustthe police.Nonetheless, Latin Americansseem moreeagerto punish civilian wrongdoers thanto limitpolice violence. Asurveyin 2015found thathalfofBraziliansbelieve “agood criminal isa dead criminal.”Reformerscould startto reduce kill-ingsbypolice with technical ﬁxes, such asequippingoﬃcerswith non-lethal weap-onslike tasers. Butthe countriesthat havedrasticallyreduced police brutality haveinstituted broad reformsto rid the justicesystem oforganised crime. In the early2000sColombia purged 12,000 corruptoﬃcers, while teachingclean ones to in-vestigate crimesmore eﬀectively.Some hopeful signshave emerged inCentral America. In Guatemala, a UN-backed team ofindependentprosecutorssecured convictionsin 2013 againstfourpolice oﬃcersresponsible forsystematickillingsofprisoners. And lastyear Hon-durasappointed a civilian-led commis-sion to vetitspolice force. Ithas alreadypurged 30% ofthe country’soﬃcers.Guatemalan and Honduran police arestill too violent. However, those countrieshave atleastadmitted thattheirproblemsstem from a rotten system, notjust badapples. In contrast, El Salvadorhas ﬁred orcharged onlya fewofthe 559 oﬃcersit hasarrested thisyearforallegedlybelongingto death squads, participatingin ﬁreﬁghtsorcommittingothercrimes.

Theysuitthe region’smountain-ouscities, manyofwhich have expandedchaotically, saysJulio Dávila ofUniversityCollege London. Ecatepec’spopulationjumped afteran earthquake hitMexicoCityin 1985.The pioneerwasMedellín, Colombia’ssecond city. Refugeesfrom the country’slongcivil warhad crowded into hillsidedistricts. Wideningstreetsto create newbuslanesorextendingthe metro wouldhave been too costly. Acable car, opened in2004, wasthe answer. Since then Cali, Ca-racasand Rio de Janeiro (aswell asMexicoCity) have builtsimilarsystems. In Sep-temberEvo Morales, Bolivia’spresident,opened La Paz’sﬁfth teleférico,extendingthe world’slongestand highestnetworkwith a linkto the cliﬀtop cityofEl Alto.One reason cable carsare popular isthatgovernmentsusuallysubsidise themin orderto compete with private buses.Mexicable chargesseven pesos(37 cents),lessthan halfofitsbreak-even price. Politi-cianslike them because theycan be builtwithoutdisplacinglarge groupsofpeople;itoften takes18 monthsorless, in time forre-election. “Mayorsthink, ‘I’m goingto becuttingthe ribbon’,” saysMrDávila.The juryisouton whethercable carsare worth the cost. In 2012 MrDávila andothersconducted a studyofMedellín’ssys-tem, which found thatcrime fell and jobsgrewin areasthe carsserved. However, thecityalso made investmentsin policing andeconomicdevelopmentatthe same time,which mayhave been responsible forthese gains. The researchersdid ﬁnd thatthe cable carmade residentsprouderoftheircommunity. People in Ecatepecfeelthe same way. Banditsgo afterbusesbutleave the cable carsalone, saysDavid Ra-mírez, a passenger.

Like otherpopu-listpoliticians, MrBabisattacked estab-lished political partiesasa cartel of insid-ers, despite himselfservingasﬁnanceministerfrom 2014-17. “Traditional partiesplaythisgame ofleftand right, but theyarenotleftand right,” MrBabissays. “Theyhave the same programme: powerandmoney.” The message worked. ANOtook29.6% ofthe vote and 78 of200 seats. Butasin manyEuropean countries,Czech politicsisfragmenting. Nine partieswill enterparliament, includingevery-thingfrom communiststo far-rightxeno-phobes, and there isno obviouscoalition.Czech unemploymentislow, the economyisgrowingand wagesare rising. Yetvotersseem more focused on fearsthatthe Euro-pean Union will force theircountryto ac-ceptrefugees, and the sense thatcorrupt in-sidershave cornered the gainsfrom thecountry’sdecades-longtransition to a mar-keteconomy. BesidesANO, the two partiesthatgained the mostwere on the politicalfringes: the Pirate Party, which came thirdwith 10.8%, followed bythe far-rightFree-dom and DirectDemocracy(SPD) party,which won 10.6%. Like MrBabis’sparty,theyembodyCzech voters’ disenchant-ment, butin diﬀerentways.Even in the colourful ﬁeld ofEuropeanfar-rightpopulists, the SPDstandsout. Thepartyisa personal vehicle foritsfounder,Tomio Okamura, whose own background(he wasborn in Tokyo, and hisfather ishalfJapanese, halfKorean) sitsoddly withhisraciallyprovocative, anti-immigrantplatform. MrOkamura hasplayed on anti-Roma prejudice byfalselyclaimingthat theNazisdid notexterminate them based onrace, butsentthem to concentration campsbecause theyrefused to work. In a countrywith a negligible Muslim presence, hewantspolice to ferretoutbackersof sharialaw. He also demandsimplausible EUre-forms(such asendingfreedom ofmove-ment), ora referendum on a Czech exit.Before enteringpolitics, MrOkamuralaunched a beermagazine and a travelagencyforstuﬀed animals, which chargedclients€90 ($123) and up to ship theirteddybearsto theirlandmarkofchoice and takeaphoto. He founded hisﬁrstparty, theDawn ofDirectDemocracy, in 2013, andwon 14 seats. Thatpartyforced him outtwo yearslater, accusinghim ofabusingfunds. MrOkamura deniesthe allegations.Butmanyobserversdoubthe can hold hisnewMPstogetherforlong, either.The Piratesare a more credible lot.Founded in 2009, theyadvocate transpa-rencyand e-government, and stronglysup-portthe EU. The party’schairman, IvanBartos, isa formerITprofessional with im-pressive dreadlocks. The Pirates’ mainstrength isin Prague, where theyalreadyhold seatsin the cityassembly. Butthey ap-peal broadlyboth to the youngand to edu-cated elitesworried byMrBabis. With thecountry’sotherpro-EUpartiesdiscreditedduringprevioustermsin government,manyliberalsturned to the Piratesas a sortofblue-blooded protestvote.MrBabisisa pragmatistwho prideshimselfon competence; the Czech govern-mentran a budgetsurpluswith him as ﬁ-nance ministerlastyear. Buthisownershipofnewspapersand othermedia leadstofearsofincipientoligarchy. Anewlaw hasforced him to place hisconglomerate,Agrofert(the country’slargestprivate em-ployer), into a trust, buthe remains thebeneﬁciary. In September, parliamentstripped him ofimmunityso thathe couldbe charged with fraud overan allegedAgrofertscheme to tap EUfunds. The elec-tion renewed hisimmunity; a newvotewould be needed to reinstate the charges. MrBabisrejectsforminga coalitionwith the SPDorwith the communists, andmoderate parties(like the conservativeCivicDemocrats, who came second with11.3%) rule outco-operatingwith him.

The parasite wasonce endemicthroughoutEurope, notjustin southern countrieslike Greece butasfarnorth asFinland. In Italyin the late19th centuryitused to kill 15,000 peopleeach year. Butbythe end ofthe last cen-turypublic-health programmeshad ridthe continentofthe disease. Today, evenin Africa and Asia, the waron malaria isgoingwell: between 2000 and 2015, theWorld Health Organisation reported a37% drop in the global incidence rate, anda60% fall in the death toll.One mightthusthinkthatin Swit-zerland, ofall places, doctorswould havelittle need foranti-malarial treatments.Yetdata from the Swisspublichealthdepartment(BAG) showthatannualcasesofP. vivaxhave recentlyjumped,from under200 in the mid-2000sto250-400 forthe pastfouryears. Similarincreasesin malaria have been recordedin Germany, France and Sweden, accord-ingto the European Centre forDiseaseControl (ECDC). Almostall ofthe Swisscasessince the startofthe migrant crisisin 2014 have been refugeesfrom Eritrea.Researchersdo notthinkanyofthevictimswere infected in Switzerland.

The 53-year-old executive recentlymoved toGrand Rapids, Michigan, to run the Ameri-can subsidiaryofhisfamilyﬁrm, whichsellsshop ﬁttingsforluxury-brand stores.Buthe feltso passionatelyaboutthe refer-endum thathe ﬂewbackto vote in hishome town ofValdagno.The governmentsofthe two regionsstaged the ballotsostensiblyto give them-selvesa popularmandate to open negotia-tionswith Rome (even though theycouldhave demanded talkswithouta vote). Bothadministrationsare dominated bytheNorthern League, which once advocatedsecession forthe richernorth.Fewpeople opposed to more autono-mybothered to vote againstit, so the size ofthe turnoutwascrucial. In Veneto, whichincludesVenice and itsﬂat, agro-industrialhinterland, the turnoutwas57% (with 98%ofthe votesin favour). Butin Lombardy,the region around Milan, itwasa mere 38%(95% forautonomy). Currently, ﬁve ofItaly’s20 regionshavemore extensive powersthan the others. IfLombardyand Veneto joined them, theywould hangon to a greatershare ofthe tax-escollected there. And since the two re-gionsgenerate about30% ofItaly’sGDP,thatcould mean much lessmoneyfordis-tribution to the poorersouth.Even though he isa memberofthe cen-tre-leftDemocraticParty(PD), MrZordanwould welcome that. “The momenthascome forItaliansto take responsibility forthemselves,” he says. The south, he argues,ismaﬁa-infested and backward, despite al-most70 yearsofsubsidies. The regionalgovernmentsofLombardyand Venetoclaim to have a combined annual ﬁscal def-icitwith the restofItalyofmore than€70bn ($82bn), equal to 8% ofnationalgovernmentspending.Asin Catalonia, the Italian votes reﬂectthe impatience ofrich northernerswithpoorsoutherners, whom theyconsidercorruptand spendthrift. Butthere the par-allelsend. The referendumsin Lombardyand Veneto were indisputablylegal andendorsed bythe Constitutional Court. Nei-therproposesindependence. And advo-catesofautonomyin Italyinvoke culturaland linguisticidentityfarlessthan seces-sionistsin Spain (even though, forover athousand years, Venice wasan indepen-dentrepublic, and itsdialectisconsideredaseparate language bymanylinguists).So whatnow? The mostcynical view isthatthe Northern League pushed the refer-endumsmerelyto raise itsproﬁle ahead ofageneral election due earlynextyear, andthatthe partyleadership maydragits feetin itspursuitofautonomy. Matteo Salvini,who hasled the partysince 2013, hasshift-ed hisfocusawayfrom purelynorthern is-sues, tryingto build a right-wingpopulistmovementwith national appeal. He haseven gone ﬁshingforvotesin the south.The referendumswere non-binding,and while autonomywon a majorityofallregistered votersin Veneto, in Lombardy itwon onlyamongthose who voted. In Mi-lan, barely30% ofregistered voterssup-ported it. The governorofLombardy, Ro-berto Maroni, said the central governmenthad agreed to talks. ButRome isunder noobligation to reach an agreement. And anydeal would need to be approved bybothchambersofthe national legislature.Nevertheless, the example ofCataloniasuggeststhatcallsforautonomycanchange inexorablyinto demandsforinde-pendence. In an interviewbefore the vote,MrMaroni scoﬀed atthe comparison withthe Spanish region, which he said wantedto be the 29th state ofthe EU. “We, no,” hesaid. Buthe added: “Notfornow.” 7Italy’s referendumsAutonomousmovementROMENorthern Italyis notasking forindependence, yet42EuropeThe EconomistOctober28th2017WHYdoesitkeep happening?

Dozensofdeputies fromthe anti-immigrantAlternative forGermanypartytake theirseatsin a Bundestagthatwassupposed neverto ﬁnd space fortheirkind, while ViktorOrban, the fatherofHungary’silliberaldemocracy, declarescentral Europe a “migrant-free zone”. Itistemptingto seeka single explanation forthese disparatephenomena. PerhapsAngela Merkel’sopen-doorrefugee policyof2015 isto blame. Maybe thisisthe rage ofthose left behind bythe uneven distribution ofglobalisation’sbooty. Oritcould bethatthe central Europeanshave had enough ofthe overbearingbully-boysofBrussels. Worse, ifthese outcomesstem from acommon cause, some feartheymightcoalesce into a commonthreat. Surveyingthe bleaklandscape, one commentatordis-cerns“an insurrection bythe HabsburgEmpire againstthe EU.” Thatisa misunderstanding.True, the likesofMrOrban or Ja-roslawKaczynski, the de facto leaderofPoland, pose a genuinethreatto the EU byunderminingitslegal order.

The newparliamentwill be chock-full ofanti-system parties(see page 40), includingMrBabis’sANO. Whatmakesthe Czechsso cranky?One clue mightlie in unreasonable expectationsabout whatEU membership could bringthe ex-communistcountriesofEu-rope. Nearly30 yearsafter1989, wagesin the Czech Republicare40% thatofneighbouringGermany. Arelated gripe isa perceivedsniﬃnessfrom the West, expressed in exaggerated central Euro-pean fearsthatfood multinationalsare dumpingsecond-rate pro-ductson to theirmarkets. The European Commission’sresponseto eastern jittershasbeen to insistthatall EU projects, such as thesingle currency, should be open to all EUcountries, notjusttheusual suspectsin the West. Butin non-euro countrieslike theCzech Republic, even mentioningeuro membership soundslikeahaughtywarningto join, orbe leftbehind. Emmanuel Macron takesa diﬀerentapproach. Overthe sum-merFrance’spresidenttoured central Europe, glad-handingfriendlyleaderswhile shunningMessrsOrban and Kaczynski.Thisdivide-and-conquerstratagem paid oﬀhandsomelythisweekwhen the Czechsand Slovaksbroke rankswith a group ofeastern European countriesto backa tighteningofcross-borderlabourrulesinside the EU, a totemicissue forMrMacron.

Political partiescome and go with alarm-ingspeed, often, aswith ANO, merelyservingasvehiclesfor theinterestsofan individual orsmall group. Bureaucracies maybemalleable to political caprice.

MrOrban hasexploited these weaknessesto reshape Hunga-ry’sinstitutionsto serve hisFideszpartyand itscronies, whilerailingagainst“globalists” like George Soros, a Hungarian-born ﬁ-nancier, and the European oﬃcialswho supposedlydance to hisdrum. MrKaczynski, despite holdingno governmentpost, hasembarked on a messianicmission to reinventthe Polish state tocorrectwhathe considersthe injusticesofthe post-1989 settle-ment.

America and China, theworld’stwo biggesteconomies,have produced the two titans ofthe industry, Amazon and Ali-baba. Both are relative young-sters. Amazon, started byJeﬀBezosasan online bookshop,had itsinitial publicoﬀering in1997. Alibaba wasfounded byJackMa in 1999. Since then bothhave been growingatbreak-neckpace, bringinglarge-scaledisruption notonlyto retailingbutto a range ofindustriesspanninglogistics, entertain-ment, advertisingand manu-facturingin theirhome coun-tries. Both have also beenexpandingtheirempiresabroad. Amazon alreadyhase-commerce sitesin 14 marketsandisplanningfurthergrowth.

InAmerica, Walmartremainsthe biggestretailerand isspendingheavilyon tryingto fend oﬀAmazon. Italso hasa stake inJD.com, an e-commerce ﬁrm based in Beijingthathad 13% oftheChinese marketlastyear. In China, Alibaba facesnotjust JDbutalso Tencent, a messagingand paymentcompanythatisnowJD’sbiggestshareholder. Smallere-commerce ﬁrmsaround theworld have the backingofgiantinvestorssuch asSoftBank,Naspersand TigerGlobal. In thisbusiness, size matters. Thanksto the powerofdata, technological expertise and large distribu-tion networks, the biggeste-commerce ﬁrmswill onlyget bigger. Data daySince retailingtouchesthe economyand societyin so manyways, e-commerce isalreadyhavingbroad eﬀectswell beyondthe industryitself. In manycountriesretail isthe biggest singleprivate employer.

Mountainsofconsumerdata, the mosttrea-sured commodityof21st-centurycommerce, are helpingmanu-facturersdevelop productsand interactwith shoppers, not justonline butincreasinglyin physical shopsaswell. The implicationsare all the broaderbecause Amazon andAlibaba, the industry’stwo mostinnovative companies, do notdeﬁne themselvesasretailersatall. Amazon doesnotjust sellgoods: itleasescargo planes, producesﬁlmsand oﬀers a voice as-sistant, Alexa.

Alibaba’sbusinessiseven broaderthan Amazon’s,includingnotjustshopping, entertainmentand cloud comput-ingbutpaymentsand social media aswell. Both companies’ ac-tivitiesgenerate cash and rich streamsofdata which can be usedto improve theirexistingservicesand add more. Alibaba de-scribesitselfasprovidingthe pipesand cablesforall kindsofbusiness. “To some extentwe are a utilitycompany,” saysDanielZhang, itschiefexecutive. “We are tryingto provide an infrastruc-ture fordigital commerce.”Consumershave alreadygained much from all this, withmore in prospect. Theyare enjoyinga broaderchoice of goodsand more price transparencythan everbefore. Instead of spend-ingtime travellingto shops, pickingup goodsand waiting inqueues, theycan nowdo otherthings.

Butithaspermeated consumers’livesin waysnotyetseen in America orEurope. Westernersshould picture a combination ofAmazon, Twitter, eBayand Pay-Pal, butbroader. Alibaba’screation storyiswell polished. JackMa, itsfounderand chairman, wasborn in Hangzhouin 1964, thesame yearasAmazon’sMrBezos, and perfected hisEnglish byof-feringfree toursofhishome town to foreigners. Hisﬁrst visittoAmerica in 1995 inspired him to setup an internetbusiness inChina. Aftera fewfalse startshe founded Alibaba in 1999 to helpChinese manufacturerssell to foreign buyers. He also estab-lished Taobao, where independentsellerscan listproducts, andTmall, an e-commerce site forbigbrands. Much more followed. Alibaba’svertiginousrise waspowered byhundredsofmillionsofincreasinglywell-oﬀChinese comingonline, andhelped alongbya dearth ofwell-established incumbents. Forex-ample, itsonline marketplace required a reliable wayto makepaymentsin a countrywhere creditcardswere still rare. So Alibaba created Alipay,adigital paymentssystem thatheld a buy-er’smoneyuntil he received hisorder andwashappywith it. Itwasspun outinto anaﬃliate, AntFinancial, in 2014.

In short, the 17 SDGs represent a holistic approach to creating a better tomorrow for our future generations.My views on sustainability were shaped by my formative years growing up in a small town called Pusing in the northern state of Perak in peninsular Malaysia. I witnessed  first-hand the impact of poverty on families and how it closed off avenues for advancement, particularly in education, for the children. And Pusing back then was largely a tin-mining town. You could not fail to notice the ugly scars on the landscape left by abandoned and disused mining pools.Poverty and environmental degradation are, thus, not abstract concepts for me. They helped form my convictions that education provides the optimum route out of poverty, and that we needed to help heal a bleeding Mother Earth. These formative childhood memories guided me in my subsequent entrepreneurial career and my philanthropic endeavours.The very birth of the company I founded in 1974, Sunway Group, was grounded — if you will pardon the pun — in the concept of sustainable development, with the development of Sunway City, located just 10 miles from the national capital, Kuala Lumpur.Four decades ago, the area was a barren land of disused and abandoned mining pools. Today, Sunway City is home to a thriving community of more than 200,000 people living, working and playing in Malaysia’s first integrated township. Apart from residential units, it houses 10 educational institutes and entities, including three universities, hotels, one of the country’s largest malls, a medical centre and Malaysia’s first-ever theme park. With more than 25,000 trees transplanted here, a complete ecosystem was restored. Today, you can find more than 150 species of flora and fauna within Sunway ADVERTISEMENTWE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHERBy Tan Sri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AOTan Sri Dr Jeffrey Cheah AO is the Founder and Chairman of Sunway Group, and Foundation Chancellor of Sunway University, Malaysia.City. Through a public-private partnership with Prasarana Malaysia Berhad, we have built a public transport system, with buses that run on electricity. Almost 50% of the city is open space and 24% of the city is green space.We have built certified green buildings and constructed our own water treatment plant — the first of its kind in Malaysia — to purify water from a local urban lake to meet potable water standards.  We have initiated a whole range of energy-saving and efficiency measures and have reduced carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 12% between 2015 and 2016. And we are not finished yet. We plan to integrate technology even more deeply to establish Sunway City as a model “Smart Sustainable City” of the 21st century.But environmental concerns are not the only SDG we address at Sunway Group.As a “Master Community Developer,” we recognise that no corporation can stand apart from the community it serves. We invest in job creation, and fill those jobs with local people. We have created an inclusive workplace for all Malaysians irrespective of race, religion, age and gender.  Half of the group’s workforce is female and a little over one-third of all Sunway Group managers are women. Sunway is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact, which unites businesses across the world under one large corporate sustainability initiative.At Sunway, education is particularly close to my heart. As soon as I was able to, we established the Jeffrey Cheah ADVERTISEMENTFoundation (JCF) to which I gifted in perpetuity all of my equity in Sunway’s educational institutions. The gift was valued at around US$180 million then, and the value has since grown to around US$250 million. The Foundation is now Malaysia’s largest education-focused social enterprise and is governed by an independent board of trustees.The foundation now owns and governs 16 educational institutions. It operates as a not-for-profit trust. Operating surpluses are reinvested into the institutions and disbursed as scholarships and research grants. The JCF has thus far given more than US$65 million to students in the form of scholarships. It is my personal goal to award more than US$250 million in my lifetime.The foundation also gifted US$10 million to the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which was used to establish the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development at Sunway University in Malaysia. The Center, launched on 9 December 2016, will mobilise comprehensive collaboration, particularly by Southeast Asian nations, to work coherently towards achieving the SDGs.Our efforts at Sunway are underpinned by our recognition that in this time of budget restraints and economic uncertainty, realising the SDGs is not the sole responsibility of Governments alone. It requires the commitment of all sectors of society — the private sector, academia, civil society and, of course, every single individual.We are all in this together. jeffreysachs.centerSunway City, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia20171980’s10The EconomistOctober28th2017SPECIAL REPORTE-COMMERCE21nese ﬁrm setitssightson South-EastAsia, itinvested in SingPost,Singapore’sstate postal system.

Butmanyshopshave had no choice butto followconsumersonline, settingup theirown e-commerce businessesastheymaintain theirbricks-and-mortarones. In the short term,thisonlyexacerbatestheirproblems. Buildingan e-commercebusinesson top ofa traditional one iscostly; ﬁrmsmust createwebsitesand ship productsto individual consumers, rather thanto storesin bulk. Itdoesnothelp thatAmazon hasconditioned consumers tothinkdeliveryshould be free. Moreover, online salesoften canni-balise those from existingshops.

Fornow,though, manyAmerican ﬁrmsare reluctantto investin such ex-pensive newtechnologyforshopsthatmaynotbe there formuch longer. In China, those oﬀeringto remedyretailers’ woesincludesome ofthe bige-commerce ﬁrms, and retailersmaybe happy toworkwith them because theirplatformsare so pervasive. In theWest, small merchantsalreadypayAmazon to listproducts on itsNO COMPANY WANTS to replicate what hap-pened to Hachette in 2014, when the publish-er balked at Amazon’s terms. Suddenly itsbook shipments seemed to be delayed andAmazon was recommending titles from otherpublishers. The dispute ended with Hachettegetting more control over pricing. But thedeal showed the risks for producers of allkinds as online platforms gain strength. The old system suited many businesses.Clothing manufacturers followed a predict-able calendar for when goods would be pro-duced and distributed. Giant makers ofhousehold products and food had to deal withstingy retailers such as Walmart, but theycould also swat away smaller competitorswith spending on expensive television ads. E-commerce is changing all this. Com-panies that sell dresses and shoes to conven-tional retailers like Macy’s ﬁnd them in tur-moil, threatened both by online sellers and bynimbler bricks-and-mortar ones such as Zara.For larger producers of packaged consumergoods, the rise of e-commerce compoundsproblems created by customers’ increasedinterest in healthier, more “natural” pro-ducts. E-commerce helps small rivals dis-tribute their products. Thanks to onlinereviews and blogs, shoppers no longer haveto rely on big brands. Yet for those brands, all is not lost.Evidence from Sanford C. Bernstein, a re-search ﬁrm, suggests that the strongest oneswill be ﬁne, just as Adele and Taylor Swifthave thrived in the age of streaming music; itis the mediocre brands that will fade away asboth smaller competitors and giant onesﬂourish. And e-commerce brings its ownopportunities. Alibaba and JDmake it easierfor big ﬁrms to reach China’s smaller cities,which are expected to provide more than 70%of new online shoppers by 2020. New dis-tribution methods can also reap eﬃcienciesby cutting out the middleman. Other stagesof a product’s life such as design and produc-tion might be transformed, too. Mattel, anAmerican toy company, is working withAlibaba to mine the Chinese ﬁrm’s data todevelop toys that appeal to Chinese mothers.E-commerce is also changing howmanufacturers advertise their goods. Compa-nies have long used cookies to follow con-sumers around the web, bidding in automat-ed auctions to place ads before the right kindof shoppers. Now those strategies are beingfurther reﬁned. Sebastien Szczepaniak, anAmazon veteran, is head of e-commerce forNestlé, the world’s biggest food company. Hematches Amazon’s data with Nestlé’s ownsources to target messages to individualsBurying the HachetteMakers of goods, from books to biscuits, are trying to adapt to e-commercerather than just to certain types of consum-ers. “We are moving from marketing to theunknown to marketing to the known,” heexplains. Chinese e-commerce ﬁrms, giventhe scope of their activities, have even moreuseful data about consumers’ habits andpurchases, both online and in stores. Meanwhile all producers will continueto worry about big online platforms amassingtoo much power. It is Amazon, not the compa-nies that sell on it, that knows what custom-ers buy, and when. It makes some of thesedata available to others, for a fee, but AliDibadj of Bernstein notes that the data arelimited and come at a high price. Amazon now looks set to wield evenmore power over manufacturers. Alexa cansuggest that consumers buy certain items, forinstance, and might eventually be pro-grammed to shop automatically. “We’ll behaving bots trying to inﬂuence your botsabout buying our products,” predicts KeithWeed, chief marketing oﬃcer for Unilever. Tocomplicate matters, Amazon is steadilyintroducing its own private-label goods tocompete. Mr Bezos’s tolerance for low pro-ﬁts—“Your margin is my opportunity,” as heonce put it—provides little comfort. “We need Amazon, and Amazon needsus,” says Mr Szczepaniak. But another exec-utive privately describes the company as a“freight train” heading for his business. Infuture, many makers the world over are likelyto pursue a three-part strategy, distributingon sites such as Amazon, in stores andthrough their own channels. Avoiding theﬁrst option is getting increasingly hard. Nike,which had withheld its products for years,recently agreed to sell on Amazon after all.

The small sellers canreach more consumersmore easily; Amazon earnsfeesand,thanksto sellers’ listings, can oﬀera broaderselection. Bigretailers, on the otherhand, seem much lesslikely toteam up with Amazon. Targetand Toys“R”Uschose Amazon tohandle theire-commerce businessesin the early2000s, butbothended the partnership, with Toys”R”Usdoingso in court.

Delivery net-worksare likelyto be strained asthe volume ofparcels grows.Thatisspurringnewexperimentsin logistics, some mundane(pickingup parcelsin stores) and some apparentlymad (Amazonpatentsforunderwaterwarehouses).

In September, BESTInc, a logisticsﬁrmbacked byAlibaba, had a disappointinginitial publicoﬀering inNewYork, in partbecause investorswere anxiousaboutlabourcosts. Pressureson e-commerce companiesto delivercheaplywill onlyrise, yetcustomersare thinlyspread, making itlesseﬃ-cientto deliverto them than to oﬃcesorshops. Anotherchallenge issortingouthowto deliverpackagesacrossinternational borders. DHL, which with FedExand UPSformsa triumvirate ofglobal parcel ﬁrms, estimatesthat 15% ofalle-commerce salesalreadymove from one countryto another. By2020 itexpectsthatshare to exceed 20% ascustomersseeklowerpricesand a broaderselection. The bigcarriersare keen to cap-ture thatbusiness. In 2014 FedExboughta companycalled Bongothatspecialisesin cross-borderdeliveries, to help customerswith dutiesand protectthem from fraud. E-commerce ﬁrmsare testinginnovationsthatmight help.Cainiao, the logisticsnetworkin which Alibaba nowowns a ma-joritystake, hasbuiltbonded warehouseswhere foreign manu-facturerscan store goods, duty-free, within China’sborders,readyto be shipped to consumers. Alibaba wantsto build free-trade zonesaround the world to help small businesseswith cus-tomsclearance, warehousingand ﬁnancing. Automation maylowercosts. In one ofJD’shuge ware-housesoutside Shanghai, men still operate forklifts, but bytheend ofthe yearrobotswill take over. Amazon’srobotsalreadybringpackagesto warehouse staﬀ. The nextfrontierof ware-house automation isforrobotsto pickindividual items and putthem in bagsorboxes. More than 90% ofsuch workisstill donebyhand. Amazon holdsa regularroboticscontestforautomatingthe process. Roboticpickersmaybe more broadlydeployed astechnologybecomescheaperand labourmore expensive. Loweringdeliverycostsistricky. Whathasbeen achievedso fardoeshelp, though itcan seem unexciting. With the aid ofmachine learning, demand ispredicted on the basisofpast shop-pingpatterns, weatherand otherinputs; thatinformation isthenused to decide which goodsshould be stored where. Amazonhasopened small warehouseswhere itkeepspopularproducts,so theycan be dispatched quicklyto impatientshoppers. Com-paniesare also tryingto concentrate deliveriesbysending goodsto central pickup pointsratherthan to customers’ homes. Retailershave longused “clickand collect” models, thoughthe ease ofcollectingonline ordersvariesgreatlyfrom one shopto another. Nowsome storesare becominghubsforonline or-dersfrom third parties.

Driverlessdeliverytrucksmayone dayhelp, and Amazonhaspatentsforﬂyingwarehousesand drone-chargingstationsatop church steeples. Butall such newmethodshave drawnscepticism. Manydronescarryonlyone parcel, then must re-charge. Asked abouttechnological changesthatmightbringdown costs, FedEx’sMrSmith says, “We don’tsee them on thehorizon forthe last-mile deliveryatpresent.” Once again, thingsare movingfasterin China. Cainiao hasdeveloped a waist-high robotcalled Little Gto undertake the ﬁ-nal legofdelivery.

Asthisexperimentation continues, once again the largestplayersare the mostlikelyto win. Theyhave the cash to pourintonewtechnologiesand the volume ofsalesto reap the beneﬁtsfrom biginvestments. IfAmerica’spostal service were to raise itscharges, MrWetherbee reckons, Amazon might, perversely, bethe one to gain. Driven byhighercharges, independentsellersthatonce used the postal service mightturn to Amazon to handletheirdistribution. Ithasmore bargainingpowerwith logisticsﬁrmslike FedExand UPSand hasrecentlyexpanded itsnetworkofdeliverypartners, usingboth regional ﬁrmsand crowd-sourced couriers. So Amazon would become even mightier. 7ASTRETCH OFBleeckerStreet, in Manhattan’sWestVil-lage, isamongthe loveliestin NewYork, with quaint shop-frontsopeningon to tree-lined pavements.

Yetthe election, even ifitproceedswithoutviolence, will notproduce the le-gitimacythatMrKenyatta needs. Ifthe Su-preme Courtwere to applythe same stan-dard thatitdid to the poll in August, itcould hardlyendorse thisone.

Nowhe iscausingmore ruc-tionsin the main opposition, with a seriesofstatementsthatare heretical to those onthe farleftofIsraeli politics. Although oth-erLabourleadershave, attimes, espousedsimilarviews, MrGabbayhasdone so ear-lierand more emphatically. He saysthat,should he win the nextelectionhe wouldnotinvite the country’sArab partiesto joinhiscoalition. And he hassaid thathe doesnotthinkthatJewish settlementsbuilt onland in the WestBank, which Israel cap-tured in 1967, should necessarilybe dis-mantled aspartofa peace agreement. Fur-therdisconcertingsome Laboursupportersishisviewthat“a Jewcannotreallynotbelieve in God.” MrGabbay’sintentionsare clear. He isdetermined to breakthe image ofLabourasa left-wingpartythatisdetached fromthe concernsand beliefsofmore conserva-tive (and religious) voters. To win an elec-tion he needsto attractsupportersawayfrom othercentristpartiesaswell as someofthose on the rightthathave propped upthe coalition governmentheaded byBin-yamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, andhisLikud party.MrGabbayisnotthe ﬁrstleader ofa La-bourpartyto tackto the right. One of thosehe hassoughtadvice from isTonyBlair, aformerBritish prime ministerand one ofthe architectsof“NewLabour”, which mo-dernised the partyand dropped itscom-mitmentto nationalisingindustry. But MrGabbayseemsmotivated bymore thanelectoral mathematics. He comesfrom a conservative family ofMoroccan origin, a group thatusually sup-portsLikud, asMrGabbayonce did. Andunlike manyofLabour’spreviousleaders,who came from the armyoroutofthe left-leaningkibbutzmovement, hisback-ground isin business.The Labourpartylastwon an electionin 1999 and hassince changed leaderseighttimes. Partymemberswho voted foraverydiﬀerentkind ofleaderthistime arewillingto give him a chance. “People onthe leftstill thinkwhathappened is justanaberration and the reinsofpowerwillsoon be handed backto us,” saysEmilieMoatti, a Labourmemberwho isplanningto run fora seatin the Knessetatthe nextelection. She lamentsthatMrNetanyahuhassuccessfully“tainted usall asunpatri-otichatersofIsrael.”Labour, which ruled Israel forits ﬁrstthree decadesafterthe state’sestablish-mentin 1948, isnotthe onlyoppositionpartyundergoingan identitycrisis. Meretz,aﬁercelysecularistpartythatdescribes it-selfas“Israel’sLeft,” hassuﬀered a seriesofelectoral defeatsthatalmostwiped thepartyout. On October18th the party’sleader, Zehava Galon, said she wasresign-ingfrom the Knessetin the hope ofspark-ing“open primaries” foritsnextleaders.“There isa deep frustration on the left overhavingdrifted awayfrom positionsof in-ﬂuence forso long,” saysNitzan Horowitz,aformermemberofthe KnessetforMe-retz.“Movingto the rightorchangingselec-tion procedureswon’tchange that.” The anomalyofIsraeli politicsis thatamajorityofvoterssupportsthe left’stwo-state solution butcontinuesto vote forright-wingleaders. Perhapsthatwillchange ifLabourisled bya right-winger. 7Rebranding the LeftIsrael’s “NewLabour”JERUSALEMTrying to grab the centreAthird way in the Jewish stateITWASlike Davosin the desert: some3,500 politicians, businessbossesandbankersfrom around the world crowdedinto a vastconference centre in Riyadh for ajamboree called the Future Investment Ini-tiative. Thiswasa giantcoming-outpartyfor“Vision 2030”, the economicplan tomove Saudi Arabia awayfrom depen-dence on oil. Itisthe brainchild of thecountry’scrown prince, Muhammad binSalman, widelyknown asMBS. Acorner-stone ofthe plan issellingsharesin SaudiAramcoin whatistouted asthe world’sbiggestIPOifitgoesahead nextyear. The youngprince proclaimed thathewantsthe kingdom to be “a countryofmoderate Islam thatisopen to the worldand open to all religions.” Asforextremistideas, “we will destroythem today.” Hisstrikingremarkscame atthe launch of anequallystrikingmega-scheme: a futuristiccity-cum-economic-zone called NEOM(from the Greekneo, meaningnew, and theArabicmostaqbal, meaningfuture).Spread over26,500 square kilometres(10,200 square miles) and along468km ofcoast, NEOMwill operate underitsownrulesratherthan those ofthe restof thekingdom. Itcould thuscreate an environ-mentoptimised fordrone deliveries, say,ordriverlesscars. Energyisto come entire-lyfrom renewable sources, thanksto anabundance ofsun and wind. Everythingthatcan be automated will be. NEOMisen-visaged asa hub between Europe, Asia andAfrica, and a home drawingin people withthe skillsto create world-classbusinessesin industriesfrom biotechnologyto food. The ambitionsforNEOMare huge. Itwill supposedlyattract$500bn ofinvest-ment, from the kingdom’sPublicInvest-mentFund and international backers. Itwantsto lead the world in both eﬃciencyand income perhead. Itaspiresto be “thesafest, mosteﬃcient, mostfuture-oriented,and bestplace to live and work.”Scepticscan pointto planselsewherefor“smartcities” (such asMasdarin theUnited Arab Emirates) thatare launchedwith much fanfare butfail to live up to thehype. In Saudi Arabia itself, the King Abd-ullah Financial Districtin Riyadh is a $10bnwhite camel. Will NEOMbe diﬀerent?Itstarts, atleast, with the credibility thatcomesfrom itsbig-name supporters. At thelaunch were an ebullientMasayoshi Son,the Japanese head ofa $100bn “VisionFund”, and Stephen Schwarzman, head ofBlackstone, a private-equitygiant.

Still, three bigquestionsstand in thewayofthe NEOMdream becominga reali-ty. The ﬁrstistiming. Can the project cometogetherfastenough to maintain momen-tum? So far, the detailsremain sketchy, andthe timingvague. The governmentsays the$500bn will arrive “overthe comingyears”. Yeta fall in oil pricessince 2014 hasalreadysqueezed publicﬁnances: this yearSaudi Arabia’sgovernmentwill probablyrun a ﬁscal deﬁcitof9% ofGDPand theeconomyhasground to a halt.Second, can NEOMgenerate bottom-upcreativityto match the top-down visionand planning? Alittle “chaos” isneeded,said the man dressed in Silicon Valley ca-sual nextto MrKleinfeld atthe launch:MarcRaibert, the bossofBoston Dynam-ics, a roboticscompany.WhetherSaudisare prepared to sit backand letsuch creative chaoshappen willalso help to answerthe third, and perhapsmostimportant, question: will NEOMat-tractthe sortofinternational talent (in-cludingwomen) itwill need to achieve itsambitions? To do so, itwill have to be amuch more relaxed, open place than thekingdom istoday. True, itisstarting tochange, asMBS’scommentsthisweekmade clear. Thanksto hisinﬂuence, wom-en will atlastbe allowed to drive next year.Maybe NEOMcan accelerate such pro-gress. Butthere isa longwayto go. Unlessitbecomesa trulydesirableplace in which to live and work, NEOMwill riskrealisingone ofitsgoals, butnotinthe wayintended. Ithopesto be the ﬁrstcitywhere robotsoutnumberpeople. 7INOCTOBER1917, in the depthsofthe ﬁrstworld war, an expectantChaim Weiz-mann waswaitingin a London anteroom.Britain’swarcabinetwasvotingon a docu-ment, nowknown asthe BalfourDeclara-tion, thatwould pledge Britain’ssupportforZionists’ hopesofstatehood in Otto-man-ruled Palestine. MarkSykes, a Britishdiplomat, rushed outto share the goodnews: “Weizmann, it’sa boy!” Butthe 67-word declaration wasvague. Itoﬀered aJewish “homeland”, nota state. NordidBritain explain howitwould be created,promisingonly“bestendeavours” to do so.The Zionistleader’sﬁrstreaction wasdis-appointment. The boy“wasnotthe one Ihad expected,” he laterwrote.Acenturyon, hissuccessorshave nosuch doubts. On November2nd BinyaminNetanyahu, Israel’sprime minister, will at-tend a dinnerin London to celebrate thedocument’scentenary. Theresa May, theBritish prime minister, will join him. Sowill Lord Balfour, a descendantofthe manwho lenthisname to the letter. In Jerusa-lem, the Knessetwill hold a special ses-sion. The British Museum maylend Israelthe original letterto puton display.YetWeizmann wasrightto be sceptical.Britain, mired in war, wasunsure how tohandle Palestine. Some oﬃcialswanted tooﬀera homeland to the Jews, in part be-cause theyhewed to the anti-SemitictropethatJewswere inﬂuential enough to bringAmerica into the warand ﬂip the Otto-mansto the Allied side. And British dip-lomatsmade contradictorypromisestothe SherifofMecca and the French.MrWeizmann believed thatthe sup-portofworld powers, particularlyBritain,would be enough to create a Jewish home-land. Atthe time Jewsmade up lessthan10% ofthe population in Palestine. Theylacked the resourcesorthe strength to es-tablish a state. With time, Britain would ob-structthe Zionistproject. To quell an Arabrevoltitpublished a white paperin 1939thatcapped Jewish immigration to Pales-tine and stated “unequivocally” thatitshould notbecome a Jewish state.Bythen, however, the Jewish commu-nityhad organised itself, formingmilitias,aparliamentand a nascentgovernment.When the UNvoted in 1947 to partition Pal-estine, the Jewsalreadyhad the trappingsoftheirstate. “Whatmattersisnotwhatthegoyim[gentiles] say, butwhatthe Jews do,”said David Ben-Gurion, the ﬁrstprimeminister. Thathistoryisstill relevant. An ascen-dantIsraeli rightwantsmore settlementsin the landsthatIsrael occupied in 1967,more restrictionson left-wingNGOs, moreeﬀortsto limit“liberal” institutionslike thecourtsand the media. Itclaimsnotto careaboutthe world’sopinion—and to be fair,much ofthe world doesnothave one. Isra-el’semergingalliesin Africa and LatinAmerica see a vibranthigh-tech sector anduseful militaryco-operation. In July MrNetanyahuwelcomed Narendra Modi toJerusalem, the ﬁrst-evervisitbyan Indianprime minister. Though onlyEgyptandJordan have recognised Israel, otherArabstates, particularlyin the Gulf, now havequietallianceswith theirone-time foe.Despite Ben-Gurion’smaxim, the cele-brationsin London and Jerusalem will be areminderthatIsrael still cravesmoral aﬃr-mation. The then Lord BalfoursawIsrael inemotional terms, a state owed to the Jewsbecause of“age-old traditionsand presentneeds.” Thatsentimentstill loomslarge.Palestinians, fortheirpart, call hisletterthe ﬁrstofmanybetrayalsbythe world.LastyearMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinianpresident, threatened to sue Britain unlessitrecognised Palestine and apologised forthe declaration. He hasspentmuch of thisdecade tryingto win international recogni-tion; in a sense, he hasbecome an unlikelyheirto MrWeizmann’sbrand ofZionism.Palestine won observerstatusatthe UNin2012, and mostcountriesin the world nowrecognise itasa state. Yetitisno closerto in-dependence than itwasin 1967. MrAbbas’scorrupt, scleroticgovern-menthasspentmuch ofthe pastdecadefeudingnotwith Israel butwith itsownpeople. Perhapsthe BalfourDeclarationhasa lesson forthe Palestiniansaswell:Britain did notcreate Israel—and nor willanotherforeign powercreate Palestine. Ifthere isto be an end to a centuryof conﬂict,itwill have to come from within. 7Acentury after BalfourPeople ofthe declarationCAIROIsrael’s founding documentstill has resonanceThe EconomistOctober28th2017471Sep 14thQueues form outside Northern Rockas Britons worry about the lender’s financial stabilitySep 15thLehman Brothers goes bustJun 23rdBritain votes toleave the EU0809101112131415161720075.505.255.755.505.255.004.503.002.001.501.000.250.50Source: Bank of EnglandBritain, official bank rate, %INAmeetingroom on a cold autumn day,the governorofthe BankofEngland set-tled into a witnesschairto give evidence toagroup ofMPs.

Concernsabouta“Christmasdebtcrisis” caused byhigherrateswere overblown, he said: “Peoplehave exaggerated the vulnerabilityof theeconomyto likelychangesin policy.”Thatwasin 2003, when Mervyn Kingwasthe bank’sgovernor. Forthe ﬁrst timehousehold debt(mortgagesplusconsumercredit) isnearing140% ofincome, which ishigh byhistorical standards. Higherinter-estrateswould resultin higherpaymentsforthose with debts. Theywould have lessmoneyleftoverforeverydayexpenses. However, manyBritonswould alsoearn more intereston theirsavings, whichare worth around 120% ofincome. Thatwould give them more spendingpower. Arise of0.25 percentage pointsin the baserate, passed on fullyto saversand borrow-ers, would costlessthan 0.1% ofincomes.No bigdeal.Yetsuch a calculation understates theprobable impactofhigherinterestrates.Forone thing, the circumstancesare un-usual. The bank’s“inﬂation-attitudessur-vey” suggeststhatwhen ithastightenedmonetarypolicyin the past, the public hasinferred thatfurtherrisesare on the way.The bankhastried before, and failed, toforestall such a reaction. The lasttime theMPC raised rates, itstressed that“no imme-diate judgmentwasbeingmade aboutthefuture path ofrates.” No matter: subse-quently, a bigmajorityofthe populationthoughtthatfurtherriseswere likely.The public’sreaction isespeciallyhardto predictthistime around. Interest ratesused to go up and down frequently. Today,aftera decade with no rate rise, manyadultsare familiaronlywith the Bank ofEngland cuttingthe costofborrowing. Ifpeople startto worrythattheirincomeswill be squeezed more tightlystill in thecomingmonths, then consumerconﬁ-dence and spendingcould fall bymorethan the MPC expects. since then, and undera diﬀerentboss,MarkCarney, the bankisexpected to startraisinginterestratesonce again, after a longperiod ofinactivity(see chart). Inﬂation is3%, well above the bank’s2% target. GDPgrewby0.4% in the third quarter, above ex-pectations. Asin the early2000s, membersofthe bank’smonetary-policycommittee(MPC) are cominground to the viewthattightermonetarypolicywill have a benigneﬀecton the economy. Are theyright? Byraisingorcuttingthe benchmark in-terestrate, the MPC inﬂuencesthe rate atwhich high-streetbankscan borrow—and,in turn, the borrowingcostsfaced byhouseholdsand ﬁrms. In the post-war per-iod itaveraged around 6%. Yetduringthecrisisof2008-09 the bankslashed ittostimulate the economy. Itwascutagainafterlastyear’sBrexitreferendum, to 0.25%,the loweston record.

Fewhave both. Data on the dis-tribution ofassetsand liabilitiesare poor.Whatevidence there is, however, makesforuncomfortable reading.One worryconcernsthose who wouldbeneﬁtfrom higherintereston their sav-ings. Income-bearingﬁnancial assets areunequallydistributed. Such inequalityalso runsalonggenerational lines. Whatwill the wealthydo with the extra incomefrom theirsavings? People with large potsare bydeﬁnition squirrellers, notsplurgers.Retireeshave a recentadditional incentiveto save anywindfall. The inheritance-taxregime isbecomingincreasinglygenerous:by2020 a couple will be able to leave £1m($1.3m) tax-free to theirchildren, if itin-cludestheirhouse, up from £650,000 lastyear. All thissuggeststhatthe boost to sav-ingsfrom higherinterestratesisunlikely totranslate into much extra spending.Owe dearOn the otherside ofthe equation, house-holdswith heavydebtsmaystruggle withhigherrates. Britain’spile ofmortgage debtisconcentrated amongfarfewerhouse-holdsthan itwasa decade ago. Prospectivebuyershave to stretch to geta footon thehousingladder. Since 2012 the averagemortgage fora ﬁrst-time buyerhasequalled 3.4 timestheirincome, up from2.6 timesatthe turn ofthe millennium. Manyhave locked in lowrateson thesemortgageswith ﬁxed-rate products. Suchdealstypicallylastforbetween two andﬁve years, however, notthe 30 yearsthatiscommon in America. And ofall outstand-ingmortgages, roughly40% are on variablerates. Ouranalysissuggeststhat, becausemortgageshave become so hefty, a giveninterest-rate rise would ultimatelyresult inabiggersqueeze on recenthomebuyers’ in-come than atanyothertime on record. PoorerBritonscould also suﬀer. Latelythe rate ofpersonal insolvencieshas risen,in partbecause oftough welfare policyand fallingreal household incomes. Thosewhose incomeshave been squeezed oftenrelyon short-term loansto tide them over.Ifthe costofrepaymentrises, more mightstruggle. Indeed, a surveyin the bank’slat-estinﬂation reportfound that, after a hypo-thetical decline in real incomes, “house-holdswho would reduce real spendingthemosttended to have fewersavingsand bemore concerned abouttheirdebt.”Whateverhappensnextweek, rateswill remain low, meaningthatmonetarypolicywill continue to favourborrowersoversavers. Butin shiftingthe balance, thebankmusttread carefully. Ithassignalledthatinterestrateswill rise onlyat a snail’space—perhaps0.25 percentage pointsev-eryyear. Amore rapid increase couldprove to be an unwelcome jolt. 7BRITAINisrunningoutoftime to ﬁnishnegotiationsbefore itisdue to leave theEuropean Union on March 29th 2019. The-resa Mayinsisted in Parliamentthisweekthatthe recentEUsummithad made im-portantprogress. Yetthe startoftalks on aframeworkforfuture trade maynothap-pen until afterDecember. Hence a favour-ite idea foravertinga “cliﬀ-edge” Brexit:transition. ThisweekBritain’sﬁve biggestbusinesslobbiesdemanded the govern-mentseekearlyagreementon a transi-tional deal to form a bridge between Brexitand a newtradingarrangement.MrsMayhasconceded thisin principle,although she still insistson calling itan“implementation” period. Thisisnotjustsemantic. She upsetbusinessesthisweekbysuggestingthat, unlessa trade deal isdone bynextautumn, there maybe noth-ingto implement. In practice, the need fortransition isclearto all, which iswhy itiscovered in the EU’sown negotiatingguide-lines. Yetthe workon itthathasnow start-ed will quicklyhitproblemsthatmaycause delays. And timingmatters. PhilipHammond, the chancellor, hasnoted thatthe value to businessofa transition planwill diminish the longerittakesto agree.Aﬁrstissue concernswhatrules to fol-lowduringtransition. MrsMayhasprom-ised thatbusinesseswill nothave to adjusttwice to Brexit, which implieskeeping cur-rentarrangementsfornow. The EUwill in-sistthatanytransition prolongthe acquis(ie, all existinglaws) and the jurisdiction ofthe European CourtofJustice (ECJ), butwithoutBritish participation in EUinstitu-tions. Jean-Claude Piris, a formerEUlegaladviser, callsthisa “full monty” transition,and suggestsitwill be the onlyversion onoﬀer. Yetitleavesquestions. Will Britain besubjectto future lawsthatithasno sayinmaking? Could ittemporarilyretain ajudge on the ECJ? Whataboutannual EUbudgetdecisions(includingon Britain’sbudgetrebate) thatare taken without anyBritish vote? Orthe controversial annualcarve-up ofﬁshingquotas?More importantmaybe legal issues.Some lawyers, includingMrPiris, reckonthattransition can be agreed underArticle50 ofthe EUtreaty, which governstheBrexitdivorce. Yetthe EUguidelinesreferonlyto whatislegallypossible. Must tran-sition be strictlytime-limited to conformwith withdrawal underArticle 50—andwhathappensifitbecomesnecessarytoroll itforward? Ifthere isno agreement oneven the frameworkfora future trade deal,can transition be legallyworkable at all, onthe basisthatunderthe article itneeds tobe a bridge to something?There are also concernsaboutthe EU’streatieswith third countries, includingfree-trade deals. Simplyrollingthese overwhen Britain isno longerformallya mem-bermaynotbe easy. Alreadythird coun-trieshave objected to plansto divide upimportquotasbetween Britain and the EU.And legal doubtsexistalso on the Britishside, since the withdrawal bill nowgoingthrough Parliamentwill repeal the 1972European CommunitiesAct. CatherineBarnard, a Cambridge lawprofessorwhoisa memberofthe UKin a ChangingEu-rope academicnetwork, pointsto uncer-taintyoverthe supremacyofEUlaw,created undersection two ofthatact.Mightthere be anotherroute to transi-tion? One idea istemporarymembershipofthe European EconomicArea (EEA),which includesNorwayand Iceland. Butthismaynotbe easyto negotiate, and itwould strain MrsMay’spromise to avoidtwo adjustments. Paul Daly, anotherCam-bridge legal academic, believesthe only le-gallywatertighttransition isto extend Arti-cle 50’stwo-yeardeadline forBrexit. Thiscan be done byunanimousagreement. Yetextension ofEUmembership beyondMarch 2019, which would preclude tradetalkswith third countries, mightnot be po-liticallysellable in Britain. ForBrexiteershave a legitimate concernthattransition could turn into a long-termprison which in eﬀectkeepsBritain in theclub asa rule-taker, nota rule-maker. TheEEAwasoriginallyconceived asa transi-tional arrangement, afterall. And manysuspectthatBrexitwill be betrayed.

From 1918 onwardsLabourrefused to workwith theCommunistPartyand banned itsmembersfrom belongingto it.ClementAttleehelped to constructNATO asa bulwarkagainstSo-vietexpansion and described Russian communism asthe “illegit-imate child ofKarl Marxand Catherine the Great”. Nye Bevan,one ofAttlee’sministers, accused the Russiansofestablishing “awhole seriesofTrojan horsesin everynation ofthe Westerneconomy”. Harold Wilson proclaimed thatthe LabourPartyowed more to Methodism than to Marxism.Yettoday’sLabourPartyhigh-command containsseveral peo-ple who are more starry-eyed than gimlet-eyed when itcomes tothe Russian revolution. JeremyCorbyn, Labour’sleader, hasre-mained remarkablysilenton revolutionaryRussia given theamountofpraise he haslathered on Venezuela and Cuba, muchofitin the pagesofthe MorningStar, a newspaperonce partiallyfunded bythe SovietUnion. The same cannotbe said ofSeumasMilne, hishead ofstrategyand a man who, accordingto a state-mentfrom MrCorbyn’speople on hisappointment, “sharesJe-remy’sworldviewalmostto the letter…theysingfrom the samehymn sheet.” MrMilne gothisstartin journalism atStraightLeft, amagazine thattookthe “Tankie” side in the argumentbetweenEurocommunists, who were critical ofthe Sovietregime, and tra-ditionalists, orTankies, who were critical ofthe criticism. He thenmoved to the Guardian bywayofThe Economistand wasa reli-able warriorforthe hard left. “Forall itsbrutalitiesand failures,”he once wrote, “communism in the SovietUnion, eastern Europeand elsewhere delivered rapid industrialisation, masseducation,job securityand huge advancesin social and genderequality.”John McDonnell, Labour’sshadowchancellor, hasclaimedthathisworldviewhasbeen shaped by“the fundamental Marx-istwritersofMarx, Lenin and Trotsky”, accordingto an interviewunearthed bythe NewStatesman. He hasalso doﬀed hiscap totwo troublingMarxistideas. One isAntonio Gramsci’snotion of“the longmarch through the institutions”: youworkwithin exist-inginstitutionsin orderto convertthem to the revolutionarycause. The otherisLeon Trotsky’snotion ofa “transitional pro-gramme”: youmake demandsthatyouknoware unachievable,in orderto stirup more discontentwith the system.One ofMrCorbyn’skeysupportersin the trade-union move-ment, AndrewMurray, makesboth MrMilne and MrMcDonnelllooklike right-wingdeviationists. He ischiefofstaﬀ to LenMcCluskey, the head ofUnite, Britain’smostpowerful union,andwasseconded bythe LabourPartyheadquartersduringthe re-centelection campaign. Along-standingmemberofthe Commu-nistPartybefore joiningLabourlastyear, MrMurrayhad a repu-tation asnotjusta Tankie buta super-Tankie, because ofhisunswervingsupportforthe SovietUnion and Uncle Joe. He oncewrote an article forthe MorningStarwhich, while lamentingSta-lin’s“harsh measures”, quoted Nikita Khrushchev’sstatementthat“againstimperialists, we are all Stalinists”. On November4thMrMurrayisdue to join Tosh McDonald, the bossofthe ASLEFtrade union, ata celebration ofthe Russian centenary.Doesanyofthisreallymatter? The SovietUnion died in thelate 1980s. International communism haseithermutated into au-tocraticcapitalism, asin China, orretreated into a few dysfunc-tional enclaves, asin Venezuela, North Korea and Cuba. The his-toryofLabourislittered with people who ﬂirted with hard-leftideasonlyto mellowon comingto power. DenisHealey, one ofthe LabourParty’sgreatchancellors, wasa Tankie asan under-graduate atMrMilne’sold Oxford college, Balliol.Alas, itdoesmatter, and forthree reasons. The ﬁrst isthatitpro-videsa measure ofjusthowmuch conventional wisdom haschanged in the pastfewyears. Positionsonce regarded as crankyoreven forbidden are becomingmainstream. The ﬁnancial crisisshattered people’sfaith in the wealth-creatingpowerofcapital-ism and the crisis-ﬁghtingpoweroftechnocrats. Asurvey byLe-gatum, a think-tank, found thatpeople feel farmore positiveaboutsocialism than aboutcapitalism. The Iraq warand the elec-tion ofDonald Trump have supercharged anti-Americanism.

Rohingyasarestill pouringinto makeshiftcamps, bring-ingwith them storiesofhowvillages wereincinerated, children shotdead, womenraped and babiestossed into canals. If theexoduscontinuesfewofthem will be leftin Myanmar.The Tatmadaw, Myanmar’sarmy, ischieﬂyresponsible forthe ethniccleans-ing. Itisaided and abetted bylocal Rakhinepoliticians, while the governmentofAungSan SuuKyi hasdone little to stop the vio-lence. Butthe UNisatfault, too. Despitehaving19 agenciesin Myanmar, and sever-al oﬃcesand plentyofstaﬀin Rakhinestate, ithasfailed to stop the catastrophe orwarn ofitscoming. Inside the UN, some oﬃcialsargue thatthose in charge ofthe mission down-played the treatmentofRohingyasto winthe co-operation ofMyanmar’sauthoritiesin orderto build schools, sanitise dirty wa-terand develop a civil service—“capacity-building” in UN-speak. The special rappor-mentin Colombo, so thattheycould pro-mote theirdevelopmentworkand receiveinternational aid. Standingup forhumanrightswasoften deemed too diﬃcult. In Myanmar, instead ofconfronting thegovernmenton behalfofthe Rohingya, theUNchampioned a policyofdevelopmentforall in Rakhine state. Thatignored howthe deliveryofserviceswould inevitablybe channelled through, and controlled by,those in power, namelyBuddhistRakhinepoliticians, the enemiesofRohingyas. Are-portcommissioned bythe mission inMyanmarin 2015 pointed outthatsuch anapproach would be “more likelyto rein-force discrimination than change it”. The Petrie reportchronicled howthe SriLankan mission recorded all the civiliandeathsattributed to the Tamil Tigers, butunderstated the numbersofcivilianskilled orwounded bythe army—again, tokeep the governmentsweet. Thispatternwasalso apparentin Rwanda in 1994 andin the United Nations-African Union Mis-sion in Darfur(UNAMID), one ofthe UN’slargest-everpeacekeepingoperations, es-tablished in 2007. In 2013 Aicha Elbasri, thespokeswoman forthe mission, resigned,handingin a listof16 caseswhere UNAMIDhad “concealed” assaultson civiliansandeven UNpeacekeepers. Ban Ki-moon, MrGuterres’spredeces-sor, commissioned anotherUNreview,which upheld ﬁve ofthe complaints. MsElBasri, Moroccan bybirth, arguesthat thedeceptionswere carried outto avoid of-fendingthe Sudanese governmentofOmaral-Bashir, addingthatAfricansin themission were keen to defend one oftheirown. MrBan said thatthe “tendencyto un-teurforhuman rightsin Myanmar, TomasQuintana, sayshe wasdiscouraged fromvisitingRakhine state bythe head of themission, Renata Lok-Dessallien. The Cana-dian deniesthis, buthasbeen recalled tothe UNheadquartersin NewYork.AUNmission, whethera multi-agencypresence asin Myanmarorone ofits15peacekeepingoperations, can be a thank-lesstask. Those in charge are constrainedbylocal and international politics. Yet theycould do much better. Myanmarisfarfromthe ﬁrstexample ofa dysfunctional mis-sion.

The whistleblower,however, forfeited herjob. Missionsneed the consentofthe hostgovernmentsto operate; the UNcannotin-vade. Buttoo often agenciesand blue hel-mets(asin the headgearworn bypeace-keepers) are lackeysofautocrats, forming“abusive” relationshipswith those in pow-er, accordingto Richard Gowan ofColum-bia University. Thisunderminesthe UN’sclaim to moral authority. The operation in the DemocraticRe-publicofCongo (DRC) isa case in point.The UNhasdeployed peacekeeperstheresince 1999, and MONUSCO, the French ac-ronym bywhich the mission isknown,nowhasabout16,000 troops, and costsmore than $1bn a year. Since 2016, the UNhasfailed to preventviolence thathasforced over1m people toﬂee theirhomes. Troopsgetawaywith de-ﬁningtheiroperatingboundariesconser-vatively. Perversely, theyare rewarded fornotusingtheirkit, astheyare reimbursedforequipmentreturned in good condition.Meanwhile MONUSCOcannoteasilygetrid ofunderperformingcivilian staﬀ,partlybecause ofpressure from trade un-ionsbutalso because ofthe complexwayin which UNheadquartersimposesitschoice ofrecruitson the mission.Standing idleAnother$1bn-per-yearmission, UNMISS,hasdone almostnothingto preventthe de-scentinto civil warand famine since SouthSudan gained independence from Sudanin 2011. The 12,500 peacekeepershave amandate to protectcivilians, buthavefailed to do so. In August2016 aid workerswere raped, beaten and robbed bySouthSudanese governmenttroopsjustminutesawayfrom the main UNcompound inJuba, the capital. Despite desperate phoneand textmessagesfrom the victims, the2,000 orso troopsneverstirred. “[The bluehelmets] are supposed to protectcivil-ians,” admitsa UNoﬃcial in South Sudan.“Buttheydon’t. Somethingisupsidedown. It’snotworking.” One reason forthe failure isthat themission askspermission from the govern-mentbefore itsendsouttroops, fearingthatotherwise politicianswill obstruct thedeliveryoffood and medicine to the starv-ingand the sickeven more than theyal-readydo. Butsince itisoften the govern-mentcarryingoutthe massacres,permission isoften refused ordelayed.The UNarguesthat, despite the mani-festfailingsofthese missions, itis bettertohave them than not. The mere presence ofitstroopscan sometimesdeterattacks, andeven ifblue helmetsare reluctantto go outand help civilians, atleastthe civilians canhuddle in and around itsbasesforprotec-tion, asin South Sudan. The UNhasno mandate to impose itswill independentlyon a country. Allpeacekeepingmissionsare authorised bythe SecurityCouncil, and subjectto ap-proval bythe General Assembly, givingChina and Russia ample room to minimisethe scope ofmissionsin the interests oftheirclientsand allies. Such wasthe case in Sudan. China hasconsiderable economicinterestshere, anditstruggled foryearsto preventany outsideintervention in Darfur. Eventually, in 2007,itdid concede to sendingin UNAMID, butonlyafterensuringthatthe mission couldcause MrBashiraslittle inconvenience aspossible. The oﬀerofWestern troops waskeptto an absolute minimum, denyingUNAMIDthe sortofkitand operational ef-ﬁciencythatmighthave made a diﬀerence.Anotherreason why, when the callgoesoutfrom NewYork, peacekeepinggenerallyattractstroopsfrom poorcoun-tries(see chart), isbecause the pay isrela-tivelyhigh. Buttheyare typicallyriskaverse. Some forcescommitcrimes. An-otherwhistleblower, AndersKompass, ex-posed allegationsofsexual abuse ofyoungchildren bytroopsin the Central AfricanRepublicin 2015.Ratherthan take on the diﬃcult taskofimprovingpeacekeepingoperations, MrBan tried to encourage reportingofabusesofhuman rights. Thatway, the theorywent, countriescould avoid the crimeswhich would lead to the intervention oftroopsin the ﬁrstplace. Hismain initiative,“Human RightsUp Front”, required allstaﬀto take responsibilityforreportingabuses. Butin Myanmarthispolicyhasfailed atﬁrstcontactwith the enemy.Remaking the peaceMrGuterreshasa chance to do much bet-ter. Forexample, he could increase the an-nual budgetforthe human-rightsoﬃce($190m), which isdwarfed bythe $12bnspenton the UN DevelopmentProgramme(UNDP). He could have headsofmissionreportto him, notto UNDP, so asto reducethe riskthathuman-rightsabusesare ig-nored byoﬃcialswho relyon local politi-cians’ supportfortheirpetprojects. MrGuterreshassaid he wantsthe UNto do more before the blue helmetshave towade in. In recentyearsithastried to medi-ate between factionsin several countries.Sometimesithasstaved oﬀall-outwar,thusavoidingthe need forpeacekeepers.Koﬁ Annan, a formersecretary-general,rescued Kenya from a descentinto furtherviolence afterdisputed electionsin 2007,forexample; a team helped to stabiliseGuinea aftera coup in the westAfricanstate in 2008; and the UN also brokered adeal in Madagascarin 2011.Buildingon these successes, MrGu-terreshascalled fora “surge in diplomacyforpeace”, and hassetup a “High-Level Ad-visoryBoard on Mediation”, which in-cludessuch luminariesasMichelle Bache-let, the presidentofChile, and JustinWelby, the Archbishop ofCanterbury.Jaw-jawis, ofcourse, betterthan war-war.

It was essentially created to promote greater transparency in the international ex-change of goods and services through a de-centralized monetary system.Today, over 2,000 types of cryptocurrency exist. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a “blockchain” that guarantees the security and reliability of the system, and the increasingly popular use of these cur-rencies is dramatically changing the flow of goods and money among companies and individuals on a worldwide scale.Of these, only one has been created specifi-cally to focus on strengthening economic ties between Japan and the Philippines. Dubbed the “Noah Ark Coin” or “NAC”, this new cryp-tocurrency addresses a wide range of issues related to both countries. From its use in foreign remittances to the Philippines from Japan (and eventually, other countries) to its upcoming implementation in an entire Philip-pine city, NAC is poised to have a wide usage base immediately upon its availability.In the case of the Philippines and Japan, Noah Ark Coin will soon become available for use by Japanese and Filipino nationals alike.One ideal use-case for Noah Ark Coin is for OFWs (overseas Filipino workers) transfer-ring funds from their country of employment back to the Philippines. The amount of funds transferred annually is huge and growing. For example, the OFW remittance flow from Japan to the Philippines just in the first half of 2017 was worth U.S. $830 million, with 10 percent growth year-on-year. In fact in 2016, total OFW remittances back to the Philippines were equivalent to U.S. $26 billion — about 10 percent of the country’s GDP. Today, OFWs must often pay relatively high bank transfer fees to send their regular contri-butions to relatives and friends.  The Noah Ark Coin directly addresses this issue. Ark Systems Technology has been contracted in the Philippines to assist Noah Ark Coin to establish a service partnership be-tween SATOSHI CITADEL INDUSTRIES (SCI), one of the largest blockchain companies in the Philippines, and NIPPON PAY, one of Ja-pan’s largest fintech companies. Eventually, all users of NAC will be able to go to a NIPPON PAY member store in Japan, simply hold their NAC wallets over NIPPON PAY terminals and easily convert Japanese yen to NAC to readily store in their electronic wallets.  This will allow the families and friends of OFWs and other NAC users to receive NAC al-most instantaneously in their own electronic wallets in the Philippines. Recipients of NAC can change their remittances to Philippine Pesos and withdraw them in cash in over 1,000 affiliate banks, convenience stores and remittance centers around the country. More-over, payment can also be made directly to pay bills for telecommunications, electricity, school tuitions, health insurance, and other expenses directly from the electronic wallets.  In the Philippines, where it is reported that up to 86 percent of the population has no bank deposits, this new system would be a huge leap forward to allowing millions greater financial independence. The implementation of NAC in Japan and the Philippines is merely part of the first phase of roll out.  Eventually, this process will be expanded to nearly all countries.In the meantime, Ark Systems continues to develop the global infrastructure for NAC. In the first half of 2017, Noah Ark Coin — with the support of Ark Systems Technologies — has entered into agreements with various Philippine real estate developers to create a network of Noah Ark Coin properties.  The first of these properties will be a 5-hect-are mixed-use resort inside the world-famous Dakak Beach Resort in Zamboanga del Norte, Mindanao. When finished, it will provide ac-cess to pristine white-sand beaches, a world-class golf course and a modern theme park complete with roller coaster rides and a nightly parade. Dubbed the first “Noah Resort”, NAC us-ers will be able to use the facilities of both the Noah Resort and Dakak Beach Resort at discounted rates, using the cryptocurrency in all areas.  NAC users will also have first ac-cess to the Noah Resort’s long-term lease program, in which private villas will be leased out on a first-come first-serve basis.The resort is strategically located in the southern Philippines, and only a short flight away from Cebu City, the popular tourist des-tination for Japanese and Korean visitors. That NAC chose to locate its first resort in the Philippines in Mindanao was not a chance decision: it precisely chose the destination as a commitment to less-developed, yet equally safe, part of the archipelago.  NAC has also entered into a development contract for a future cryptocurrency-friendly city to be called “Noah City”. Noah City will be located within a reclaimed land project right in Manila Bay.  The entire project is planned to encompass 419 hectares, created in conjunction with the City of Manila, a Dutch dredging partner and one of the Philippines’ fastest growing real estate developers. Within Noah City, NAC will be freely useable across retailers, service pro-viders and food and beverage outlets. NAC is currently available for pre-sale in Ja-pan only, and will officially launch to the public in the first quarter of 2018.  NAC will be avail-able in major cryptocurrency exchanges soon after the public launch. •Noah Ark Coin (NAC) is initially aimed at linking Japanese users to a growing network of NAC services in the Philippines and around the world, and at streamlining OFW (overseas Filipino worker) remittances from Japan and globally.Representatives from SCI Philippines speak to a Japanese audience in Tokyo at one of Noah Ark Coin’s presale events in September of 2017.www.arkhold.cowww.sci.phwww.dakakresort.comProduced by:An inexpensive remittance service available through NOAH ARK COINOverseasForeign WorkerOverseas ForeignWorker's sideParticipating Store(s)of Nippon PayJapan sideOverseas Foreign Worker's sidePhilippines sideOverseas Foreign Worker’s Family's side(cid:638)Exchanging Currency of Japanese Yen toNOAH ARK COIN from Participating store(s)(cid:633)(cid:638)Payment of exchange fee to particpating store(s)(cid:638)Implement NOAH ARK COIN's wallet operation:Deposits, Manage Amount Balance, Money Transferand ATM withdrawal(cid:633)MoneyTransferNOAH ARK COINNOAH ARK COINNOAH ARK COINWalletplatform providedby SCIplatform providedby SCIWalletATMbanksBANKElectric bills,Celphone bills andother various payments Electric bills,Celphone bills andother various payments CurrencyExchangeVariousPaymentsWithdrawin CashTHE PHILIPPINES: LEADING ASEAN’S 50TH ANNIVERSARYWORLD EYE REPORTSADVERTISEMENTThe EconomistOctober28th2017 Business612MrRyan isalso busyfunnelling.

Yetin the case ofApple, itseems thatthe op-posite ishappeningand ﬁnance istakingovertech bystealth.Since the death ofSteve Jobs, itsco-founder, in 2011, the world’sbiggestﬁrm bymarketvalue hassold hundredsofmillions ofphoneswith bionicchipsand know-it-all digital assistants. Butithasalso grown a ﬁnancial operation thatisalready, on somemeasures, roughlyhalfthe size ofGoldman Sachs.Apple doesnotorganise itsﬁnancial activitiesinto onesubsid-iary, butSchumpeterhaslumped them together. The result—call it“Apple Capital”—has$262bn ofassets, $108bn ofdebt, and hastraded $1.6trn ofsecuritiessince 2011. Itappearsto be run fairlycautiouslyand ispartofa thrivingﬁrm, butitstill deserves scruti-ny. Companieshave a historyofbeinghurtbytheirﬁnancialarms; thinkGeneral Electric(GE) orGeneral Motors(GM). Apple Capital haslotsofresponsibilitiesbutthree stand out. Itinveststhe ﬁrm’smountain ofsurplusproﬁts, mainlyin “highlyrated” instruments(thistaskseemsto fall to Braeburn Capital, asubsidiaryin Nevada, which usessome external fund managers).Apple Capital also usesderivativesin orderto protectthe ﬁrmagainstcurrencyand interest-rate gyrations. And itmanagesAmerica’sﬁfth-biggestcorporate-debtpile byissuingApplebondsaspartofan elaborate strategyto limittaxbills.Apple Capital hasbecome importantto itsparent. Since Jobsdied, itsassetshave risen by221%, twice asfastasthe company’ssales, reﬂectingApple’shuge build-up ofproﬁts. Itsinvestmentsare worth 32% ofApple’smarketvalue, and itsproﬁts(investmentincome, plusgainson derivatives, lessinterestcosts) have been7% ofApple’spre-taxproﬁtsso farthisyear. Itisalso sizeable com-pared with otherﬁnancial ﬁrms. Considerfourmeasures: assets,debt, creditexposure and proﬁts. Dependingon the yardstick, Ap-ple Capital is30-85% asbigasGoldman Sachs. Itis22-42% aslargeasGECapital wasatitspeakin 2007, justbefore thingswentdown the tubesduringthe subprime crisis.Apple Capital isdiﬀerentfrom these ﬁrmsin important ways.Itdoesnottake depositsand hasmuch lowerleverage. In theirprime Goldman and GECapital were run byhard-chargingﬁnan-ciers, and made lotsofloans. Bycontrast, Apple Capital doesnotmake loans, and isnotmeantto be a proﬁtcentre in its own right.Nonetheless, ithasbecome riskier, in three ways.First, Apple Capital isinvestingin racierassets, which involvestakingcreditrisk. In 2011a majorityofitsassetswere “risk-free”:cash orgovernmentbonds. Today68% are invested in otherkindsofsecurities, mainlycorporate bonds, which Apple says are gen-erallyinvestmentgrade. The shiftmayexplain whyApple’san-nual interestrate earned on itsportfolio (2%) isnowhigherthanthatofthe fourotherSilicon Valleyﬁrmswith moneymountains,Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco and Oracle. In total, theystill have 66%oftheirportfoliossquirrelled awayin risk-free assets.Second, Apple’sderivativesbookhasgotmuch bigger. Since2011itsnotional size—the face value ofitscontracts—has risen by425%, to $124bn. Thisisstill much smallerthan bigbanks’ posi-tions, butisthe third-largestbookofanynon-ﬁnancial ﬁrm inAmerica, afterGEand Ford. Foreverydollarofforeign sales, Ap-ple has89 centsofderivatives, compared with 57 centsforthe oth-erfourtech giants. Atpointsthese derivativeshave yielded bigre-wards. In 2015 theycontributed $4bn, or6% ofApple’sproﬁts. Buttheyhave dangers, too. Apple saysthatits“value-at-risk” (VAR), astatistical measure ofthe maximum likelylossin an average day,is$434m. Thatishuge: similarto the combined VARofthe world’stop ten investmentbanks. In theorylosseson derivatives wouldbe oﬀsetbygainsin the value ofApple’sunderlyingbusiness. Butthe sheersize ofthese positionsgivespause forthought.The lastarea ofhigherriskisApple’sdivided geography. Its for-eign operation swimsin cash while itsdomesticone drowns indebt. Proﬁtsmade abroad are keptin foreign subsidiaries. ThatwayApple doesnotpaythe 35% levyAmerica chargeswhenearningsare repatriated. Some 94% ofApple Capital’sassetsare“oﬀshore” and cannotbe tapped forordinarypurposes. The do-mesticbusinessmustdo the hard workofpayingfordividendsand buy-backs. Itsproﬁtsare notbigenough to coverthese, so itborrows. Domesticnetdebtshave risen to $92bn, orﬁve timesdomesticgrossoperatingproﬁts. Each yearApple mustissue$30bn ofbonds(includingreﬁnancing), similarto the average ofWall Street’sﬁve largestﬁrms.Apple’score businessisso proﬁtable thatitis—almost—incon-ceivable thata blow-up atApple Capital could lead to it needingtaxpayerorcentral-banksupport, aswasthe case forGMand GE.Still, itiseasyto imagine howApple Capital could hurt itsparent.Amarketshockcould lead to losseson itsportfolios. A two-per-centage-pointrise in interestrateswould resultin a loss of$10bn.Ifbond marketsdried up, Apple mightstruggle to issue so muchdebtand have to bringhome funds, incurringa bigtaxbill. Itmightalso become trickyto run such a bigderivativesportfolio.Don’tupsetthe Apple cartApple Capital hasgrown in a forgivingperiod forﬁnancial mar-kets. Thatwon’tlast. Overtime, the riskofmission creep will rise,aswill the temptation to investin riskierassets. On the currenttrajectory, by2022 itsassetswill reach $400bn and debts$250bn.Bythen ﬁnancial regulators, who do notsupervise Apple, will begrindingtheirteeth atnight.Accordingto a formermanagerwho leftin 2012, Apple’sﬁnan-cial guruswere careful because “nobodywanted that3am callfrom Steve Jobs”. ButJobsisn’tthere anymore. In anycase, a fearofrebuke isnotenough.

The ﬁnancialcrisislefthim untouched (take yourpick).Hissuccessor, Stephen Squeri, promotedfrom within and apparentlygroomed forthe job, takesoverin February.Forall that, MrChenault’slongtenurehasnotbeen an unequivocal triumph.Though generatingstrongreturnson assetsand equity, American Expresshascontin-ued itsslide within the fast-changing andcompetitive paymentsindustry. Accordingto Nilson, an industrybible, in 1974 theamountofmoneyforpurchaseschan-nelled through American Expresswasequivalentto 50% ofwhatwentthroughMasterCard and 70% ofwhatwentthrough Visa. By2016, those ratioshadshrunkto 30% and 14%.American Expresshasgrown nonethe-less, ascredit-card usage hassurged. Butthe bestdaysmaybe over. Itsshare price,revenuesand proﬁtsall peaked in 2014.

In the process itcollectsa fee. Italso oﬀerssystems such asVenmo (intended forpaymentsbetweenindividualsbutsometimesused bysmallbusinesses, too), Braintree, a ﬁnancial linkused byUberand Airbnb, and Xoom, a re-mittance service.Competition abroad isjustaskeen.American Expressentered Asia earlyandonce had an enviable position there, but itspresence hasfaded. In 2007 itsold (to Stan-dard Chartered) a private bankcreated al-mosta centuryago thathad languishedfrom inattention. Japan’sJCBhasissued al-mostasmanycards(butstill accounts forfarlessin transactions).

The entire mechanicsofpayments arebeingrethought, with cardsbeingreplacedbyQRcodes, biometricsand more.In thisnoisyhothouse, MrChenault de-servesrespectforkeepingAmerican Ex-presshealthy.

Compet-itive pressure will squeeze thisfurther.In the past, merchantswere willing topayforAmerican Expresstransactions be-cause itscardholderswere well-oﬀandwillingto spend. Butnowlarge banks aregoingafterthese customers. JPMorganChase and Citigroup, both with card busi-nessesheaded byex-Amexers, have issuedcardsthatprovide beneﬁtsbroadlyregard-ed asbetterthan those from American Ex-press. Soon BankofAmerica will follow.Bankshave also taken aim atlucrative co-brandingdealscarryingexclusive rewardsforcustomers. In 2015 American Expresslostone such deal with Costco, a large re-tailerthataccounted for10% ofitstransac-tion volume, to Citigroup.

MrChenault’stenure maythusbe remembered merelyasapause before the end ofan era.7DIVORCESare rarelyeasy. In the 16monthssince Britain voted to leavethe EUin a referendum, the negotiationshave made little progress. One ofthe trick-iestaspectsisthe amountthatBritainshould payto meetitsexistingspendingcommitmentsforEUprogrammes. Thisisnotanalogousto dividing upthe bill in a restaurant, and deciding whohad the lobsterand who stuckto themixed green salad. Take the costof EUof-ﬁcials’ pensions. The trickybitin calculat-ingitisthatpensionsare long-term com-mitments; a bureaucratwho startsworkin Brusselstodaymightstill be collecting apension 70 yearsfrom now. Workingoutthe costisﬁendishlycomplicated, requir-ingestimatesofhowmuch wageswillrise (ifthe pension islinked to salary) andhowlongemployeeswill live. Then thesum offuture beneﬁtshasto be discount-ed atsome rate to workoutthe currentcost; the higherthe discountrate, the low-erthe presumed expense.The EUdoesn’tpre-fund pensionsforitsoﬃcials; itpaysthem asthey fall due.So the calculationsdon’tneed to involveanyassumptionsaboutinvestmentre-turns. Butthe costestimate needed forBritain to payits“fairshare” will dependon whatdiscountrate getsused. And thatcould be the subjectofa bigdispute.In itsannual accounts, the EUcalcu-latesa pension liabilityof€67.2bn($79.3bn). Thisisbased on a discount rateof1.7% in nominal termsand 0.3% in realterms(afterinﬂation). Thiscosthasjumped from around €35bn in 2011be-cause the discountrate hasfallen sharply.Thisrate hasnotbeen plucked outof thinair; itisbased on the interestrates paid onEUgovernmentdebt. An agreementtopaya pension is, afterall, a debt like anyother. So itmayseem thatthere is little toargue about; Britain should simplycoughup itsshare of€67.2bn.However, when itcomesto calculatingthe contributionsofemployees, the EUusesa completelydiﬀerentapproach. AsaEurostatdocumentshows*, the discountrate in these numbersisa 22-yearaverageofreal government-bond yields. Thisin-cludesthe period from 1995 to 2000, whenreal rateswere often 4% orhigher. The re-sultisa nominal discountrate of4.8% andareal rate of3.1%.Up until 2012, the EUused a 12-yearaver-age ofbond yields. Butitissteadily movingto a 30-yearaverage by2021, which meansthatthose high real yieldsfrom the late1990swill stayin the numbersforlonger.The remarkable resultisthatwhile the dis-countrate in the balance-sheetcalcula-tionshasbeen falling, the discountrateused forthe contribution ofoﬃcials rose in2016. The good newsforemployeesisthattheywere required to contribute 0.5% lessoftheirsalariesthan would otherwisehave been the case. Had the EUused the discountrate it ap-plied to itsbalance-sheetto calculate thesize ofcontributions, itsoﬃcialswouldhave had to stump up a lotmore—resultingin signiﬁcantcutsin take-home pay. So it isunderstandable thatithassoftened theblow. ButBritain issurelyatliberty to ar-gue thatwhatissauce forEUbureaucratsoughtto be sauce forBritish taxpayers aswell. Bruegel, a think-tankin Brussels,concluded that, ifthismore generous dis-countrate were used, the British pensionsbill would fall bybetween a third andmore than half. In cash, thatcould be€2.5bn-4bn.All Britain hasto do, then, isargue thiscase. ButEUnegotiatorsmightaskhowBritain calculatesthe pension liability foritsown publicservants. Unfortunately,the accountsofthe England and Walesteachers’ pension scheme showa real dis-countrate ofjust0.24%. Thatwould un-dermine the logicofthe British argument.Anotherapproach mightbe forBritainsimplyto payitsshare ofthe pensions billeveryyear; afterall, thatiswhat the EUdoesatthe moment. Then Britain wouldnotbe “punished” bythe use ofa histori-callylowdiscountrate. Butthe snagwould be thatBritain could still be payingoutforsome bureaucratsin the 2070s, cre-atingthe kind offesteringsore that thecountry’stabloidswill complain aboutfordecades(and demand thatsome fu-ture governmentrepudiates). Perhapssome cunningBritish civil ser-vanthasfound a wayofescapingthis di-lemma.

India’slenderswithstoodthe meltdown of2007-08 well, butthenembarked on an ill-advised lendingspree,backinglotsofinfrastructure projects thatgotsnarled in bureaucracy. Bad loans piledup. State-owned lenders, which accountforaround two-thirdsofthe sector, nowhave “stressed” loansof10.5trn rupees,abouta ﬁfth oftheirbook.Bankshave been reluctantto acknowl-edge thatmoneytheyhave lentisunlikelyto be repaid, in partbecause thatwouldtriggera loss, which in turn depletes thebank’sequity(the moneyshareholders in-vest). State-owned banksalreadyhaveequitylevelsclose to regulatorymini-mums, so theyhave preferred to pretendthateven theirropiestborrowerswill paythem backin full. Atthe veryleast, theydon’thave the capacityto extend newloans. Predictably, bank-creditgrowth hasslumped, recentlynearingrecord lows.Thatisone reason whyyear-on-yearGDPgrowth slowed to 5.7% in the second quar-ter, from well over7% a yearago.Despite the roundaboutmethod ofre-capitalisation, gettingmoneyinto thebankingsystem isgood policy. Bankers arebeingencouraged to use a newbankruptcycode to deal with bustborrowers; havingfresh equitymakesiteasierforthem to ac-knowledge pastmistakesand move on.Detailsofthe bail-outscheme are pend-ing, butmayresemble a rescue plan in the1990s, wherebybanksﬁnanced “recapital-isation bonds” issued bythe government.The proceedswere used to subscribe tobanks’ rightsissues. (Bankswill have toraise 580bn rupeesthemselves, perhapsbysellingnon-core assets, and receive a fur-ther180bn rupeesfrom governmentcof-fersleftoverfrom a previousscheme.)

Nail-biting decisionsTHE president’staxpromise hasalwaysbeen clear: he will reduce the amountmiddle-earners, butnotrich Americans,mustpay. Yeteverytime Donald Trump re-leasesa plan, analystssayitdoesalmostthe opposite. The TaxPolicyCentre, athink-tank, recentlyﬁlled in the blanks inthe latestRepublican taxproposalsandconcluded thatmore than halfofitsgive-awayswould go to the top 1% ofearners.Theirincomeswould rise byan average of$130,000; middle-earnerswould getjust$660. The White House maintainsthattaxreform will delivera much heftierboost toworkers’ paypackets. Who isright?The disagreementboilsdown to whobeneﬁtswhen taxeson corporationsfall.The TaxPolicyCentresaysitismainly richinvestors. Butin a reportreleased on Octo-ber16th, MrTrump’sCouncil ofEconomicAdvisers(CEA) claimed thatcuttingthecorporate-taxrate from 35% to 20%, asRe-publicanspropose, would eventuallyboostannual wagesbya staggering$4,000-9,000 forthe average household.The claim hassparked a debate amongeconomiststhatisasill-tempered as itisgeeky. Left-leaningeconomistsare incredu-lous. Writingin the Wall StreetJournal, Ja-son Furman, who led theCEAunderBa-rackObama, pointed outthatifthe reportisright, wage increaseswould total aboutthree to sixtimesthe costofthe tax cut.LarrySummers, a formertreasurysecre-tary, wrote thatifa studentsubmitted theCEApaper, he “would be hard pressed togive ita passinggrade”.Conservative economists, such asGreg-oryMankiwofHarvard UniversityandCaseyMulligan ofthe UniversityofChica-go, have responded with a barrage ofalge-bra and diagrams. Theynote thattaxes, be-cause theydistortincentives, can cost theeconomymore than theyraise in rev-enues. Economistscall the extra cost“deadweightloss”. Once itisreclaimed, taxcutscould beneﬁtworkersand ﬁrmsbymore than theycostthe Treasury. For in-stance, investmentmightrise aftercor-porate taxesfall, sparkingcompetition forworkersand pushingwagesup. What’smore, standard theorysaysthat, in a smalleconomyintegrated with global markets,workerswill payfortaxeson capital, be-cause ﬁrmscan up stickswhen levies rise. Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong, twoleft-wingeconomists, have ﬁred back theirown Greekand graphs, laced with snark.ButMessrsMankiwand Mulligan showedthatthe CEA’sprediction isatleastlogicallypossible. Thatdoesnotmean itisreason-able. There are three reasonsto doubt it. First, to calculate itsﬁgures, the WhiteHouse relied on two studies, neitherfrom apeer-reviewed journal, ofhowwageshavevaried with corporate-taxratesinterna-tionallyand acrossAmerican states. A re-centreviewofsuch papers, byJane Grav-elle ofthe Congressional Research Service,found both to be statisticallyﬂawed. In anycase, MihirDesai ofHarvard BusinessSchool, who co-wrote one ofthem, saysthatthe CEAmisinterpreted hiswork. Ifyouassumed the corporate taxcreates adeadweightlossworth ten timesthe rev-enue itraises, youmightjustifythe CEA’snumbers, he says. Butthatisimplausible.(AsThe Economistwentto press, the CEAwaspreparinga second reportusingothermethodsto justifythe ﬁgures.)Second, the American economyisplainlynotsmall. Thismakescapital lessﬂighty. And although itmayhave becomemore mobile because ofglobalisation,manyinvestmentopportunitiesin Ameri-ca—in Silicon Valley, say—are hard to repli-cate elsewhere. Thisalso makesa high cor-porate-taxrate lesslikelyto sendinvestmentabroad.Third, the White House’sanalysisig-noresotherfeaturesofthe Republican taxplan, like a proposal to switch to a “territo-rial” corporate-taxsystem. Because thiswould stop taxingthe foreign proﬁts ofAmerican ﬁrms, itmightactuallyencour-age investmentabroad. And if, asislikely,the taxcutisﬁnanced byborrowing, itislikelyto push up interestratesand the dol-lar. Thatwould create an economicdrag. The White House hasrushed to includethe CEA’spaperin itsargumentfortax cuts.Yetthe estimate ismore than a little opti-mistic. There isno clearrelationship be-tween recentcorporate-taxcutsand wagegrowth in rich countries(see chart). Eventhe TaxFoundation, a think-tankthat looksfavourablyon corporate-taxcuts, predictsamuch smallerwage boost. Should Re-publicansgettheirway, Americanscan ex-pecta payrise—justnota bumperone. 7Tax cuts and wagesCorporations arepeople, tooWASHINGTON, DCWill cuts in American corporate taxboostAmericans’ wages?AustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaCzech RepublicDenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyHungaryIrelandIsraelItalyKoreaLuxembourgMexicoNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwayPolandSlovak RepublicSloveniaSwitzerlandUnited KingdomUnited StatesLabour and capitalSource: OECD*Based on 2016 $ at purchasing-power parityOECD countries, 2011-16Change in corporate-tax rates, percentage pointsChange in real wages*, %0.100.10.20.30.4+–1050510+–EstoniaGreeceIcelandJapanLatviaPortugalSpainSwedenChileCorrection:In “How green is my value?” (October 21st)we said that employees of the World Bank are “in openrebellion against their boss”.

Theyhave little reason to be coy;in Sweden youcan learn a stranger’ssalarysimplybyringing thetaxauthoritiesand asking. Paytransparencycan be a potentweapon againstpersistentinequities. When hackerspublished e-mailsfrom executivesatSonyPictures, a ﬁlm studio, the worldlearned thatsome ofHollywood’smostbankable female starsearned lessthan theirmale co-stars. The revelation has sincehelped women in the industrydrive harderbargains. Yet outsideNordiccountriestransparencyfacesﬁerce resistance. DonaldTrump recentlycancelled a rule setbyBarackObama requiringlarge ﬁrmsto provide more paydata to anti-discrimination regu-lators. Even those lesstemperamentallyaverse to sunlight thanMrTrump balkatwhatcan seem an intrusion into a private mat-ter. Thatisa shame. Despite the discomfortthattransparency cancause, itwould be betterto publish more information. There isa straightforward economicargumentformaking paypublic. Asalaryisa price—thatofan individual worker’slabour—and marketsworkbestwhen pricesare known. Publicpay datashould help people make betterdecisionsaboutwhich skills toacquire and where to work. Yetexperimentswith transparencyare motivated onlyrarelybya love ofmarketeﬃciency, and moreoften byworryaboutinequality. In the early1990s, itwasoutrageatsoaringexecutive salarieswhich led American regulators todemand more disclosure ofCEOs’ pay. Such transparencydoesnotalwaysworkasintended. Compensation exploded in the1990s, asﬁrmsworried thatmarketswould interpretskimpy pay-packetsasan indicatorofthe qualityofexecutive hires.Despite this, bossestend to oppose transparency, for under-standable reasons. Firmshave an easiertime in paynegotiationswhen theyknowmore aboutsalariesthan workersdo. What ismore, shininga lighton paygapscan poison morale, as someworkerslearn thattheyearn substantiallylessthan their peers. Astudyofemployeesatthe UniversityofCalifornia, for instance,found thatwhen workerswere given accessto a database listingthe salaryofeverypublicemployee, job satisfaction amongthose on relativelylowwagesfell. In industriesin which competi-tion fortalented workersisintense, the perniciouseﬀects on mo-rale ofunequal paycreate an incentive to splitthe high-wagepartsofthe businessfrom the rest. Research published in 2016concluded thatdivergingpaybetween ﬁrms(asopposed to with-in them) could accountformostofthe increase in American in-equalityin recentdecades. Thatdivergence in turn resulted fromincreased segregation ofworkersinto high- and low-wage ﬁrms.Yettransparencyincreasesdissatisfaction notbecause itintro-ducesinformation where there wasnone before, butbecause itcorrectsmisperceptions. Surveysroutinelyﬁnd thatworkersoverestimate theirperformance and payrelative to their peers’.Thisistrue acrosseconomiesaswell aswithin ﬁrms. In 2001, taxrecordsin Norwaywere putonline, allowinganyone to see easilywhatotherNorwegianshad earned and paid in tax. Reportedhappinessamongthe rich rose signiﬁcantly, while the well-beingofpoorerpeople fell astheylearned theirtrue position on theeconomicladder. Betterinformation changesbehaviour. Low-paid workersatthe UniversityofCalifornia became more likelyto seeknewjobsaftersalarydata became public. In Norway thepoorbecame more likelyto supportredistribution. Transparencymightthreaten the function ofcapitalist econo-miesifpeople were implacablyopposed to paygaps, but theyarenot. Astudypublished in 2015 offactoryworkersin India, for in-stance, found thatunequal payworsened morale and led to re-duced eﬀortwhen workerscould notsee others’ contributions,butnotwhen productivitydiﬀerenceswere easilyobservable. Yetin the modern economy, individual contributionsare of-ten devilishlyhard to assess. Simple theorysuggeststhat workersare paid accordingto theirproductivity. Were theyto earn more,theiremployerswould lose money; were theyto earn less, otherﬁrmscould proﬁtbyhiringawayunderpaid employees. But al-though itiseasyenough to see howmanyshirtsa textile workerstitchesin an hour, itismuch harderto evaluate the contributionofone memberofa team thathasspentyearsdeveloping newsoftware. Whenitisdiﬃcultto observe importantparts ofa job,economistsbelieve thattryingto linkpaycloselyto narrow mea-suresofperformance can be misguided. Workersinevitably ne-glectmurkybutcritical tasksin favourofthose the boss can easilyquantify. In the knowledge economy, therefore, the relationshipbetween payand productivityisoften loose.Paygapsare often nonethelessjustiﬁed. Workerswith scarceand valuable skillscan easilythreaten to leave, and can thereforebargain forhigherpay.

Butincreasedopennessaboutpaycould improve both the fairnessand thefunctioningofthe economy. When payispublic, itisnot the justi-ﬁable inequitiesthatcreate the mostdiscomfort, butthose ﬁrmscannotdefend.7Too tightto mentionFirms should make more information aboutsalaries publicFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchange.................................................................................................Studies cited in this article can be found at economist.com/transparency2017The EconomistOctober28th201769For daily analysis and debate on science andtechnology, visitEconomist.com/science1AWISE driverkeepsan eye on the fuelgauge, to make timelystopsatﬁllingstations.

Andthe copperwire involved isan invitation tothieves. Manyengineerswould thereforelike to develop a second wayofchargingelectricvehicles—one thatiswireless andcan thusbe buried underground.Electrical induction, the underlyingprinciple behind wirelesscharging, wasdiscovered byMichael Faradayin 1831, andiswidelyused in thingssuch aselectricmotorsand generators. Faradayobservedthatmovinga conductorthrough a mag-neticﬁeld induced a currentin that con-ductor. Subsequentinvestigationsshowedthatthisalso worksifthe conductor issta-tionaryand the magneticﬁeld ismoving.Since electriccurrentsgenerate magneticﬁelds, and ifthe currentalternates so doesthe ﬁeld, an alternatingcurrentcreates aﬁeld thatiscontinuouslymoving.

Howbadlysperm whaleswere hitbywhalingishard to know, buttheirpopula-tion iscertainlyrecovering. America’sNa-tional Oceanicand AtmosphericAgency(NOAA) estimatesthat, since the morato-rium wentinto eﬀectin 1986, theirpopula-tion hasgrown atabout4% a year. AndAlaskan ﬁshermen are suﬀeringasa result.Overthe past20 years, ﬁshermen oftheGulfofAlaska ﬂeet, sailingfrom ports suchasJuneau, have reported sperm whalesstrippingtheirlinesofblackcod as theyhaul them in.

The E. colishe used haddefective antibiotic-resistance genes. Cru-cially, the mutationsthathad broken thesegenescould in principle be ﬁxed with anadenine deaminase thatworked on DNA.She therefore created a vastrange of vari-antsofthe RNAversion ofthe gene, hopingthatsome mightinstead workon DNA—and manifestthatfactbysavingbacteriathatwould otherwise die when theywereexposed to antibiotics. Bypickingthe mostpromisingvariants,mutatingthem again, and repeatingtheprocess, she eventuallyarrived atan en-zyme thatcould be attached to CRISPR-Cas9 in orderto accomplish the conver-sion ofA-Tbase pairsinto G-C. And itworks. The combined base-editingtoolshave the desired eﬀectmore than half thetime. UsingCRISPR-Cas9 alone forsuchpoint-mutation workisonly4% eﬀective.Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 often createsun-wanted insertionsordeletionsofDNA.Base editingcreatesalmostnone.

In the paperFengZhang, oftheBroad Institute, in Cambridge, Massachu-setts, who wasone ofthe pioneersof theCRISPR-Cas9 technique, describesa baseeditormade from Cas13, an enzyme thatcutsRNAin the waythatCas9 cutsDNA,and a second enzyme thatcan reverse theeﬀectofG-to-Amutations.

Butthe rest, though theycould notﬂy, neverthelessseem to have had patternsin theirplumage, justasbirdsdo. This canbe seen from the distribution in their fos-silsofpigmentparticlescalled melano-somes. And a studyled byFiann Smith-wickand Jakob Vintheratthe UniversityofBristol, published thisweekin CurrentBiology, reportsthe discoveryofremark-able markingson the face ofone such the-ropod. Sinosauropteryx, itseems, worebanditmasks.Sinosauropteryx(pictured alongside,with feathersclearlyvisible) wasa metre-longanimal thatlived 126m yearsago, dur-ingthe Cretaceousperiod, in whatis nowChina. To determine whetheritsplumagepattern mightbe deciphered, DrVintherﬂewthere to examine the three best-pre-served specimens, two ofwhich are inNanjingand one in Beijing. He teamed upwith some colleaguesto use a special cam-era to take high-resolution picturesof theplumage ofthese three specimens. Whenhe and MrSmithwickanalysed the resultsbycomputertheyfound, to theirsurprise, adistinctstripe ofdarkfeathersthat ranacrossthe animals’ facesand around bothoftheireyes.Banditmaskshave neverpreviouslybeen seen in a dinosaur. Theyare, though,found in manymodern species. Raccoonsand ferretshave classicbanditmasks. Bee-eaters, ospreysand kookaburrashave simi-lareye-disguisingpatterns. And badgersand skunksalso have darkeye-crossingstripes, though in theircasesthese runalongthe animals’ snouts, ratherthanacrosstheirfaces. Researchersargue aboutthe functionofbanditmasks, and theymay, indeed,have more than one. Mostanimalshaveevolved an acute sensitivityto the eyes ofothers. Disguisingeyes, asa real banditmaskdoes, would help stop preyspottingpredatorypeepersthatwere studyingthem justbefore theirownerlunged for thekill.

The livinghave longspied thedead—and soughtnewexplanationsfordoingso. In the 15th centurypeoplethoughttheywere the soulsofthose suﬀer-ingin purgatory, appearingto askfor inter-cession and a quickpassage to heaven.When the English Reformation did awaywith purgatory, ghostswere still spotted,“apparentlyunaware thattheyhad beendeclared doctrinal impossibilities”.

Workslike “Hamlet” were careful toincorporate both interpretations.The ghostremained in rude healththrough the Enlightenment. In the spirit ofthe Royal Society’smotto, Nulliusin verba—take nobody’sword forit—men such asJohn Aubreytravelled around Britain com-pilingand classifyingaccountsofsuper-natural phenomena underthe disciplineof“HermetickPhilosophy”. Materialistthinkerslike Hobbes—who argued thatghosts“are in no place; thatisto say, that areno where; thatisto say, thatseeming to besomewhat, are nothing”—were metwithﬁerce opposition. Joseph Glanvill, authorofa hugelypopularvolume ofghoststo-ries, deployed the terminologyofFrancisBacon to argue thatghostscan be observedand perceived, thusmustbe real.

in 2016, or260m tonnes, according to UNCTAD, andvolumes are forecast to grow by 3.2% ayear until 2022. The industry, whichhandles 80% of global trade by volume,has struggled with overcapacity in recentyears, but improvement in the globaleconomy has helped reverse the declinein freight rates. Despite ﬁve years ofslowing capacity growth, supply stilloutstrips demand. In 2016 the container-shipping market’s operating losses were$3.5bn. A wave of “mega-alliances”(three groups now control 77% of globalcapacity) may help cut the excess supply,but concerns of an oligopolistic marketare rising, placing greater pressure onregulators to ensure competition.82The EconomistOctober28th2017THEYhad alwaysgrown red peas, soCornelia Baileythoughtnothingof it.She and herhusband dropped the seed inthe spring, Frankhoeingand she follow-ing. Theyplanted on a growingmoon, notawastingone, and when the tide wascom-ingin; ifa pregnantwoman could do thesowing, so much the better. Theywaited,too, until the pecan treesputouttheir blos-som. Itwassafe then to plantwhatyouliked. Nothingcould fool the pecans. Generallythe peaswere eaten up bythe family, which included a crowd ofadopted and fosterchildren aswell as herown. Butone daya cheffrom Atlantaasked forsome and paid hera cheque forthem. Sapelo red peas, itturned out, werenotonlyprettyto lookatbuta gourmettaste and rare. More customerscame along,so she expanded the plot. She then thoughtshe could make a businessoutofit, andthatthismightsave herisland.ForSapelo wasdying. HogHammock,where she lived, wasthe lastcommunityofSaltwaterGeechee on the island, andthe island the lastundeveloped place inthe chain ofSea Islandsrunningdown thecoastofSouth Carolina and Georgia. TheGeechee-Gullah people were directde-scendantsofAfrican slavesbroughtover toworkrice plantationsin the 18th century;theyhad a hundred westAfrican ways, asshe did with herpea-planting. So many ofthe thingsshe watched herfatherdo—mak-inglongcast-nets, weavingbasketsfromsweet-grass, dancingarms-outlike a cir-clingbuzzard while hisfriendsbeattheground with sticks—had come from Africa.Much ofthe food she ate, the rice, okra,peanutsand vegetable stew, wasAfrican.And a whole African spirit-world sur-rounded her. “Hags” pinned herdown inbed atnight, dead relationscalled hername and tried to lure herinto the woods,“rootdoctors” brewed up poisoned moon-shine and could puta hexon neighbours, ifyouasked.Herdescentwasfrom Bilali, a Muslimslave so imposingthathe wasthe managerfora white plantation-owner. With herstraightlookand straighttalk, she had in-herited hisforcefulness. The shortform ofCornelia, “Nia”, meant“she who hasa pur-pose”. Herswasto save Sapelo and, with it,everythingthatmade up herlife—the smellofthe saltmarsh, the taste ofsweet pota-toesdugoutofhotashes, the nightchorusofcricketsand frogs. In the 1950sdevelop-ers“from oﬀ” began to descend on theisland’smilesofwhite beachesand forestsoflive oaksand palmetto, astheyhad onotherislands. AnyGeechee who farmedplotswere slowlypushed outuntil HogHammockbecame theironlyrefuge. Butbuzzardswere circlingthatplace,too. In 1910 around 500 people lived there.By2012 there were 50 orso. The two-roomschool she attended from 1951, in herbestplaid dress, closed down. The BigHousesofwhite landownerswentto the state andtheirland to a reserve, so jobsin “Massaﬁelds” vanished. Meanwhile, those eagerdevelopershelped push propertytaxessky-high. No wonderpeople left. When ababywasborn on Sapelo, the afterbirthwasalwaysburied to tie itto the island. ButMissKatie, the lastmidwife who knew thatpiece ofAfrican magic, retired after deliver-ingGregBailey, herfourth child, and noone followed. There wasno more old-fash-ioned anything. Justa heavyloss.Touristscould help, and she welcomedthem, up to a point. She tookoverthe oldstore and stocked itwith cloth dolls andscuppernongjelly; she helped run SapeloDays, when everyone dressed up nicelyforthe visitors, cooked theirbestfoods andhad theirbestmanners. In the heartof HogHammockshe and Frankbuilta six-bedinn “ForNature LoversOnly”. Butshe didnotwantoutsidersto staytoo long. Hereyeswatered to thinkofno more cotton, nomore sawmills; hercommunityjustthingsin a museum, to be poked atand stared at. Avisitto westAfrica reinforced herpur-pose. There, in thrivingvillages, she foundthe same okra and smoked ﬁsh in the mar-ket, the same waysofcarryingbundles onheads, even the buzzard dance, thatsheknewfrom home. Bya miracle, thesethingshad survived in herown tinyout-poston the coastofthe United States. In avillage in Sierra Leone a woman dressedherin gold fabricand made hera para-mountchief. Itgave herthe deepestglow inherlife, and made hereven more ofa ﬁght-er. AslongasGeechee wayswere racing inhermind, she had to talkaboutthem.The funeral bellHogHammockalso had to be a workingentity, justasitused to be. Areal “make-do”society, where people’swealth wasnotmoneyin the bankbuta piece ofland topasson to theirchildren. She would ratheritwasall-black, asitwasbackthen; and ifanyone thoughtthatwasracist, she did notgive a hoot. Everybodywasstill kin, rightfrom those Africansin the beginning.Herhopeswere seton the red-peas pro-jectand a second one, to bringbackPurpleRibbon sugarcane. She imagined the wire-grassﬁeldslookinglush again, and jobsand people returning. Whynot? Atthe ageofthree she had died, and waslaid in a cof-ﬁn, aftergettinga feverfrom eating unripepears. The funeral bell had tolled for herfrom the FirstAfrican Baptistchurch; UncleNero keptsaying, “Burythe chile.” Butanaunthad rubbed herhard with garlicallover, and she came round.
