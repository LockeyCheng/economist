Fortunately,the presidenthesitated, partlybecause he wantsChina’shelpin thwartingNorth Korea’snuc-learambitions. Butthatisnotthe end ofthe story. TensionsoverChina’sindustrial mightnowthreaten the architecture ofthe global economy. America’strade representative thisweekcalled China an “unprecedented” threatthatcannotbe tamedbyexistingtrade rules. The European Union, worried by aspate ofChinese acquisitions, isdraftingstricterrules on for-eign investment. And, all the while, China’sstrategyformo-dernisingitseconomyisaddingfurtherstrain.Atthe heartofthese tensionsisone simple, overwhelmingfact: ﬁrmsaround the world face evermore intense competi-tion from theirChinese rivals. China isnotthe ﬁrst countrytoindustrialise, butnone hasevermade the leap so rapidly andon such a monumental scale. Little more than a decade agoChinese boom townschurned outzips, socksand cigarettelighters. Todaythe countryisatthe global frontier ofnewtech-nologyin everythingfrom mobile paymentsto driverless cars. Even asChina’sachievementsinspire awe, there isgrowingconcern thatthe world will be dominated byan economy thatdoesnotplayfair. Businessesfeel threatened. Governmentsthathave seen Brexitand the election ofMrTrump, worryaboutthe eﬀectsofjob lossesand shrinkingtechnologicalleadership. Yetifthe outcome isto be good, theymust all thinkclearlyaboutthe real nature ofChina’schallenge.Go, in three dimensionsUndoubtedly, China hasform. Itkeptitscurrencycheap foryears, boostingexporters; itﬁnancesitsstate-owned giantswith cheap credit; and itscyber-spiessteal secrets. Yetdepic-tionsofcorporate China asjustan undemocratic, state-runmonster, thievingand cheatingto getahead, are crude and outofdate. Home-grown innovation isﬂourishing(see page 17).The innovatorsare mainlyprivate, notthe manyheads ofasingle creature called China Inc. To separate hype from reality,thinkofChinese competition ashavingthree dimensions: ille-gal, intense and unfair. Each needsa diﬀerentresponse.First, considerillegality. The bestexample isthe blatanttheftofintellectual propertythatmakesforthe most sensa-tional headlines, such asthe chargeslaid in 2014 againstﬁveChinese militaryoﬃcersforhackinginto American nuclear,solarand metalsﬁrms. The good newsissuch crimesare de-clining. An agreementwith America in 2015 seeminglyled to amarked drop in Chinese hacksofforeign companiesand, asChinese ﬁrmsproduce more ofvalue, theyare themselves de-mandingbetterintellectual-propertyprotection athome.The second dimension—intense butlegal competition—isfarmore important. Chinese ﬁrmshave proven thatthey canmake good productsforless. Consumerpricesfortelevisions,adjusted forquality, fell bymore than 90% in the 15 yearsafterChina joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO). China’sshare ofglobal exportshasrisen to 14%, the highestanycoun-tryhasreached since America in 1968. Thatmayfall asChinalosesitsgrip on low-value industriessuch astextiles. Butitisgaininga newreputation in high tech. Ifdata are the newoil,China’stech industryhasvastreservesin the information gen-erated bythe hundredsofmillionsofitspeople online—unpro-tected byprivacyrules. Whetheryoumake carsin Germany,semiconductorsin America orrobotsin Japan, the chances arethatin future some ofyourﬁercestrivalswill be Chinese.Last, and hardestto deal with, isunfaircompetition: sharppractice thatbreaksno global rules. The governmentdemandsthatﬁrmsgive awaytechnologyasthe costofadmission toChina’svastmarket(see page 60). Foreign ﬁrmshave been tar-geted in the biggestofChina’santi-monopolycases. The gov-ernmentrestrictsaccessto lucrative sectors, while ﬁnancingassaultson those same industriesabroad. Such behaviour isdangerouspreciselybecause today’srulesoﬀerno redress.Don’tgetangry. GetevenSortingChinese competition into these categorieshelps cali-brate the response. Blatantillegalityisthe moststraightfor-ward. Governmentsmustprosecute and seekredress, whetherthrough the courtsorthe WTO. Firmscan betterprotectthem-selvesagainstcyber-thieves—from China and elsewhere. Though itispoliticallyhard, the bestresponse to intensecompetition isto welcome it. Consumerswill gain from lowercostsand fasterinnovation. Misguided attemptsto hold backthe tide would notonlylose those potential gainsbut mightalso blowup the world tradingsystem, with catastrophic re-sults. Ratherthan tryto stop the lossofjobs, governmentsshould provide retrainingand a decentsafetynet. Both com-paniesand governmentsneed to spend more on educationand research. Sixyearsago BarackObama said America facedanew“Sputnikmoment” in China’srise. Since then notmuchextra hasbeen devoted to research, trainingand infrastructure.The hardestcategoryiscompetition thatisunfair, butnotil-legal. One approach isto coaxChina into behavingbetter byactingcollectively. America, Europe and bigAsian countriescould jointlypublish information abouteconomicharm fromChina’spolicies—astheydid bysharingdetailsabout overca-pacityin the steel industry, nudgingChina into cutting itsex-cesses. Theyshould demand reciprocity, requiringChina togive foreign companiesthe same accessthatitsown ﬁrms en-joyin theirmarkets. Governmentsneed to reviewtheir poli-ciesforscreeninginvestmentsfrom China so thatthey canblockgenuine threatsto national security(though only those).And theyshould also require thatinvestorswith state backingreportthisin full, and punish those hidingtheirtrue identity.Much ofthe responsibilityforputtingthisrightfalls on Chi-na. Itmayaskwhyitshould hold itselfback. Afterall, 19th-cen-turyGermanyand America grewrich behind subsidiesand ta-riﬀwalls; Britain and Japan were bullies. Yet, having done sowell outofthe global commercial ecosystem, China should re-cognise thatithasbecome one ofitscustodians. Abuse it—ille-gallyorbyoverburdeningit—and itwill break.7Does China playfair?Competition from China will onlygetﬁercer. Thatcalls forcool heads and wise policiesLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistSeptember23rd20171ONCE the giantsofthe inter-netcould do no wrong.Nowtheyare a favourite targetofpoliticianseverywhere. Eu-rope’sﬁnance ministersare dis-cussingwaysto increase taxeson digital services. Theresa May,Britain’sprime minister, thisweekdemanded thatsocial-media platformsbe able to takedown terroristmaterial within two hours. In America Face-book’sbossesmustsoon tell Congresswhatrole userstied toRussia played in lastyear’spresidential campaign.Much ofthisisstill political theatre. Butnotall. America’sSenate iscontemplatingthe Stop EnablingSexTraﬃckers Act(SESTA), a bipartisan bill thatseeksto detersextraﬃcking byensuringthatthe CommunicationsDecencyAct(CDA) doesnotprotectonline services, such asBackpage.com, notoriousformakingmoneywith sex-traﬃckingads(see page 54).Should the bill pass, a wave oflawsuitsagainstsocial-mediaplatformsislikelyto follow.SESTA highlightsa growingproblem with which manygov-ernmentsare grappling: howonline ﬁrmsshould be held lia-ble forillegal contentthatispublished on theirplatforms.From October, Germanywill require ﬁrmsto take down hatespeech and fake newswithin 24 hours, orface ﬁnesofup to€50m ($60m). Yetthe debate overSESTA isespeciallyimpor-tant. Itcould end up beingthe model forotherareas, chillingfree speech and innovation. Ifthe internetand some ofthe ﬁrmsithasspawned havetaken overthe world, thisisthe resultnotsimplyof entrepre-neurial brilliance butalso ofan implicitsubsidy. In Americaand Europe online platformshave until nowinhabited a paral-lel legal universe. Broadlyspeaking, relevantmedia laws—inparticularthe CDA—exemptthem from liabilityforwhattheirusersdo orforthe harm thattheirservicescan cause.Thismade sense in the earlydaysofthe internet, when itwasstill a sideshow. Ruinouslawsuitsmighthave crushedthen-infantdigital ventures. Buttodayonline ﬁrmshave cometo dominate entire industries. Theycan also no longer be con-sidered neutral conduitsforinformation, like telecoms carri-ers. Facebook’salgorithms, forinstance, determine whatmemberssee in theirnewsfeeds. The wordsand deedsof on-line ghoulshave consequencesin the real world.SESTAhasa worthyaim. Yetitistoo broad. Itgreatly ex-pandsthe deﬁnition ofenablingsextraﬃcking, including tenactions, from advertisingto transporting. Itwould also letstateattorneys-general and civil claimantssue online platforms. Adeluge oflawsuitsislikely. In general, bigtech ﬁrms can aﬀordsuch programmes, butstartupsmayface bankruptcy. Both willwantto avoid trouble byerringon the side ofsafety, curbingfree speech.Web-friendlyRatherthan attemptto deﬁne preciselywhatmaterial isbanned—which invitesarguments—the lawshould instead re-quire ﬁrmsonlyto followa reasonable, transparentprocess bywhich theydecide whatto take down. Thatwould cover siteslike Backpage.com and limitpotential lawsuits. Itshould takeinto accountdiﬀerencesin size. Smallerﬁrmscould be held to adiﬀerentstandard, dependingon theirresourcesand businessmodels. Widelyaccessible sitescould be more tightly regulat-ed than those with a restricted audience.The drawbackisthatthisturnsonline ﬁrms, especially bigones, into arbitersofacceptable speech. Butitwould be prefer-able to a seriesofall-controlling, SESTA-like laws, which couldultimatelyturn them into regulated utilities(see Schumpeter).To avoid thatfate, theyneed to realise that, asthe dominantac-torsofthe digital age, theybearspecial responsibility. 7Online regulationLimited liabilityThe internethas grown up, and so mustits biggestcompaniesSPAINhasknown tumultuoustimes: civil warin the 1930s,dictatorship until 1975, a failedcoup in 1981, a ﬁnancial and eco-nomiccrash in 2008-13, and ter-rorism ofthe nationalistand ji-hadistsorts. Nowitfacesaconstitutional crisisthatthreat-ensitsunity. The Catalan governmentplansto hold a “bind-ing” referendum on independence on October1st. Ifa majorityvotesyes—regardlessofthe turnout—then CarlesPuigdemont,the Catalan president, will unilaterallydeclare independence.

Itis, to outward ap-pearances, a lovelyand successful place. Yeta majority ofCat-alansare unhappywith theirlot, feelingthatSpain takes toomuch oftheirmoneyand failsto accord respectto their identi-ty(see page 41). MrRajoyhasbeen wrongto assume that timeand economicrecoverywould cure Catalans’ discontent.The Spanish constitution, adopted byreferendum in 1978—and backed almostunanimouslyin Catalonia—proclaimsthecountry’s“indissoluble unity”. Itvestssovereigntyin theSpanish people asa whole, notin the inhabitantsofits constit-uentparts. The Catalan governmentclaimsthe rightto self-de-termination. Butinternational lawrecognisesthisonly incasesofcolonialism, foreign invasion orgrossdiscriminationand abuse ofhuman rights. These arguablydo applyto theKurds, who are planningto hold a disputed referendum on se-cession from Iraq on September25th (see page 38). Catalonia, however, hardlycountsascolonised, occupiedoroppressed. ManySpaniardsworrythatitssecession couldswiftlybe followed bythatofthe Basque country. If the rule oflawisto mean anything, the constitution should be upheld.MrPuigdemontshould thusstep backfrom hisreckless refer-endum. Opponentsare unlikelyto turn out, so anyyes vote heobtainswill be questionable, notjustlegallybutpolitically.Thatsaid, byplayingcat-and-mouse with ballotboxes MrRa-joyhasneedlesslygiven MrPuigdemonta propaganda vic-tory. AbigmajorityofMrRajoy’svotersin the restofSpainsupporthim in partbecause he refusesto yield to Catalan na-tionalism. Butsomethingimportantiswrongin Spain, and itishisdutyto tryto ﬁxit.Democracyrequiresconsentaswell asthe rule oflaw. Con-stitutional change, especiallythe rightto breakaway, shouldbe diﬃcult—butnotimpossible. In Scotland and Quebec, al-lowingpeople to have a saydid notlead to breakaway. MrRa-joyshould be lessdefensive: he should nowseekto negotiate anewsettlementwith Catalonia, while also oﬀeringto rewritethe constitution to allowreferendumson secession, but onlywith a clearmajorityon a high turnout. Damage to CataloniaManyCatalanswantthe rightto decide, butpollssuggest thatonlyaround 40% wantindependence. Mostwould probablybe satisﬁed with a newdeal thatgave them clearerpowers, letthem keep more oftheirmoneyand symbolicallyrecognisedtheirsense ofnationhood. The tragedyisthatneither MrPuig-demontnorMrRajoyseemsinterested in puttingsuch an oﬀeron the table. 7IN267ADNicantinousand De-metrius, two teenage wrest-lers, had reached the ﬁnal boutin a prestigiouscompetition inEgypt.

Now, with theConservatives’ majorityfreshlywiped outand the prime ministerstrugglingto unite her partyaround a single vision ofBrexit(see Bagehot), the unthinkableimage ofa left-wingﬁrebrand in 10 DowningStreetisincreas-inglyplausible. Bookmakershave him asfavourite to be Brit-ain’snextprime minister. Labourneed win onlyseven seatsfrom the Toriesto give MrCorbyn the chance to form a rulingcoalition. He will be received atnextweek’sLabourPartycon-ference asa prime ministerin waiting.There are two visionsofa future Corbyn government. One,outlined in Labour’selection manifesto earlierthisyear, isaprogramme thatfeelsdated and left-wingbyrecentBritishstandardsbutwhich would notraise eyebrowsin much ofwestern Europe, nordo the countrycatastrophicharm. Theother, which can be pieced togetherfrom the recentstatementsand lifelongbeliefsofMrCorbyn and hisinnercircle, isa rad-ical agenda thatcould cause grave and lastingdamage to Brit-ain’sprosperityand security. The future ofthe Labour Party—and, quite probably, ofthe country—dependson which ofthese visionsbecomesreality.Good Corbyn, bad CorbynThe manifesto launched thisspringwasinsipid and back-ward-looking, dustingoﬀtried and discarded ideas. But itwould setBritain backyears, notdecades. The planned rise incorporation tax—a bad idea ata time when BrexitBritain needsto clingon to whatbusinessitcan—would take the rate backonlyto itslevel in 2011. Aproposed minimum wage of£10($13.50) perhourwould be amongthe steepestin Europe, butnotdrasticallyhigherthan thatplanned bythe Tories. Abolish-ingtuition feeswould damage universitiesand mainly beneﬁtthe well-oﬀ, while nationalisingthe railwaysand some utili-tieswould make them lesseﬃcientand starve them of invest-ment. These are bad ideas, butnotthe policiesto turn a coun-tryto rubble. IfLabourcombined them with an approach toBrexitthatwaslessself-harmingthan thatofthe Tories—someofwhom are still gunningforthe kamikaze “no deal” out-come—itsprospectuscould even be the lessbattyofthe two.Butthere isanotherplan forgovernment, scattered amongMrCorbyn’sown statements, which would do seriousandlastingharm (see page 47). Since becomingleader, he hascalled fora maximum wage aswell asa minimum one. He hasproposed “people’squantitative easing”, underwhich the gov-ernmentwould orderthe independentBankofEngland toprintmoneyto fund publicinvestments. Labouriscommittedto preservingBritain’snuclearweapons: MrCorbyn isdisarm-inglyclearabouthisdesire to scrap them. Though the party’spolicyisto stayin NATO, MrCorbyn hasfordecadescalled foritto disband; lastyearhe refused to saywhether, as prime min-ister, he would defend a NATO allyunderattackfrom Russia.Labour’smanifesto saysthatanotherindependence refer-endum in Scotland is“unwanted and unnecessary”; MrCor-byn hassaid itwould be “ﬁne”—which matters, because hismostlikelyroute to DowningStreetwould be with the supportofthe Scottish National Party. On Brexit, Labourisas hazyasthe Tories. Butitsnotional priority, accessto the single market,isatoddswith MrCorbyn’slifelongscepticism ofglobalisa-tion in general and ofthe EU in particular.All leadersmustcompromise with theirparties. But itisrarefora leader’spersonal viewsto contrastso stronglywith thosein hismanifesto. Rarerstill isthe companyMrCorbyn keeps.AndrewFisher, the main authorofthe manifesto, hasprevi-ouslyargued forthe nationalisation ofall banks; Andrew Mur-ray, a formerCommunistPartyoﬃcial who advised Mr Cor-byn duringthe election, hasdefended the regime in NorthKorea. Youcan imagine how, surrounded bysuch people, MrCorbyn would instinctivelyline up againstAmerica in a geo-political emergency, and howhe would see a ﬁnancial crisisasActOne in the collapse ofcapitalism.Paintthe doorredThe constraintson such wild behaviourare loosening. Theﬁrstofthose isthe party’sMPs. Eightoutoften supported amotion ofno conﬁdence in theirleaderlastyear. Yet manywanted rid ofMrCorbyn mainlybecause theyfeared that hewould lose them theirjobs. With theirmajoritiesnewly in-creased and powerin sight, theyhave quietened down. Trou-blemakerscan be threatened with deselection, and new par-liamentarycandidatesvetted. Nextweek’sconference isexpected to reduce the powerofLabourMPsand MEPs.The party’sbureaucraticstraitjacketsare also loosening.Corbynitesare nowjustaboutin the majorityon Labour’sNa-tional Executive Committee, where theirnumberswill bestrengthened byplansto appointmore trade unionists and or-dinarymembers. The run-up to the conference hasseen Cor-bynite candidatestrouncingcentristsin electionsto commit-tee chairmanships. JustasTonyBlairsidelined left-wingactivistsduringthe 1990s, MrCorbyn isempoweringthem.Labour’shalf-million-odd membersare ﬁred up asneverbefore, campaigningon footand online. Mostfavoura moreradical programme. Arecentsurveyfound thattheirprioritywasto move the partyfurtherto the left. One snagfor MrCor-byn isthattheyare overwhelminglypro-EU; ifhe were sincereaboutthe partybeingruled byitsmembers, notelites, hemightagree atnextweek’sconference to advocate continuedfull membership ofthe single market. In practice, it seemsthatthe viewsofordinarymembersmatterlessthan those of hard-core activists, who share MrCorbyn’sEuroscepticism.The mostrapidlyunravellingconstrainton MrCorbyn,however, isthe opposition he faces. HiscautiousJune manifes-to waswritten aspollssuggested thatLabourcould be wipedout. Nowhe standswith powerin sight, facinga humiliatedConservative government. Hisroom formanoeuvre expandsbythe week. June’sexperimentwith diluted Corbynism was asuccess. Expectthe nextdose to be stronger. 7British politicsThe likelyladLabouris on trackto rule Britain.

I am aMAKER, forthe heartsofthedream.” So goesa rallyingcrycarved ingiantletterson the wall ofa warehouse inShekou, a seaside enclave nearHongKong.ManyofChina’smostpromisingentrepre-neursﬂocked there recentlyfora confer-ence organised byTechCrunch, a technol-ogypublisherfrom Silicon Valley. YetBaidu, Alibaba and Tencent—establishedChinese internetgiantscollectivelyknownasthe BAT—were overshadowed byup-startssuch asDidi Chuxing, a ride-hailingﬁrm thatchased America’sUberawayfrom China, and Ofo, a bike-sharingstart-up thatisgoingglobal.Theyare partofa newwave ofinven-tive youngﬁrmsemergingfrom China. Afewyearsago, Chinese innovation meantcopycatsand counterfeits. The drivingforce isnowan audacious, talented andgloballyminded generation ofentrepre-neurs. Investorsare placingbigbets onthem. Around $77bn ofventure-capital(VC) investmentpoured into Chinese ﬁrmsfrom 2014 to 2016, up from $12bn between2011and 2013. LastyearChina led the worldin ﬁnancial-technologyinvestmentsand isclosingon America, the global pacesetter,in othersectors(see chart1on nextpage).China’s89 unicorns(startupsvalued at$1bn ormore) are worth over$350bn, byone recentestimate, approachingthe com-bined valuation ofAmerica’s(see chart2on nextpage). And to victorsgo greatspoils. There are 609 billionairesin Chinacompared with 552 in America.“Innovation movesfasterhere,” insistsKai-FuLee, a formerhead ofGoogle’sChi-nese operationswho nowrunsSinovationVentures, a VCfund and acceleratorin Bei-jing. Gone are the “C2C” (copyto China)and “JGE” (justgood enough) strategies oftheirparochial predecessors. China’snim-ble newinnovatorsare usingworld-classtechnologiesfrom supercomputingtogene editing. Havingestablished them-selvesin the cut-throatmainland market,manyare headingabroad.There are three main reasonswhyChi-na’sdetermined entrepreneurscan ex-pand theirbusinessesrapidly. First, theeconomy, the world’ssecond largest, is bigenough to letﬁrmsattain huge scale justbysucceedingathome. Ithelpsthatlanguageand culture are more homogeneousthanin Europe and physical infrastructure (suchasroadsand wirelessbroadband) isnewand excellent, unlike in America. Second, Chinese shoppersare vora-ciousand venturesome, an advantage toinnovatorswith cleverproductsbutunfa-miliarbrands. Theyare also unusually ea-gerto embrace technology. China’spene-tration ratesformobile phonesandbroadband internetare high, makingiteasyforstartupsto reach a vastmarketcheaply. And China israpidlybecomingcashless. The volume ofmobile paymentsshotup almostfourfold lastyear, to $8.6trn,compared with just$112bn in America.ThisiswhyChina breedsﬁnancial-tech-nologystartupsso quicklyand ishome tomanyofthe world’smostvaluable ﬁntechﬁrms. AntFinancial, spun outofAlibaba,maybe worth more than $60bn. Third, state-dominated industries rang-ingfrom telecommunicationsand bankingto health care are woefullyineﬃcient andeven hostile to consumers. Thisallows ag-ile newcomers, with businessmodelsthatputthe customerﬁrstand deploythe latesttechnologies, to jump ahead ofincum-bentsmore easilyin China than their coun-terpartsin developed markets.Moving atChina speedThe government’sinabilityto run indus-trieswell iscounterbalanced bya willing-nessto supportnewventures, which inturn hastensinnovation in areassuch astransport. David FreyofKPMG, a consul-tancy, believesthatithasplayed a usefulrole asa “market-maker”, one reason whyChina isfarahead ofAmerica in both elec-tric-vehicle (EV) registrationsand the num-berofchargingfacilities. Arecentan-nouncementofan eventual ban on petrolengines(probablyafter2030) could help tosecure a long-term lead in the global EVmarket. Butthe mostuseful change was adecision to allowventure-backed startupswithoutpreviouscarmakingexperience toentera ﬁeld previouslydominated by in-eptﬁrmscrankingoutsubparEVs.The nextwaveSHEKOUAnewgeneration ofChinese entrepreneurs will have a powerful impactonindustries and consumers worldwide BrieﬁngInnovation in China18BrieﬁngInnovationinChinaThe Economist September23rd201712ConsiderNio, a three-year-old automo-tive company. Itsheadquartersand re-search centre are tucked awayin a hugecomplexoflow-rise buildingsin Shang-hai’sJiadingdistrict, a clusterthat aspirestobecome the DetroitofChina. Itisthe brain-child ofLi Bin, one ofChina’smostformi-dable serial entrepreneurs. He made a for-tune through BitAuto, a pioneeringonlineplatform forbuyingand sellingcars. Healso conceived and launched Mobike,Ofo’smain rival in the boomingbike-shar-ingmarket, and isstill itschairman. Nio,backed bythe country’smostastute early-stage investors, includingChina’sHill-house Capital and America’sSequoia Cap-ital, isvalued ataround $3bn.Leapingto a whiteboard, MrLi calcu-latesthatthe impactChina’scarshave hadon the planetoverthe pastdecade equalsthatofall carsin the previous100 years.“From 2000 to 2017,” he adds, sketchingadecliningcurve, “there wasdiminishinghappinessfrom owninga car.” Traﬃc, pol-lution and accidentswere to blame.

The ﬁrm hasdeveloped much ofitstechnologyin-house. Itemployspeoplefrom 40 countries, some poached from es-tablished carmakersincludingFord andVolkswagen.

Asforrivals, he isconﬁdentthat“Nio can do much betterthan Tesla.” Venturesome consumersalso playarole in fosteringinnovation. The Chineseare keen to trynewproductsand are moreforgivingthan Westernersiftheyare notperfect. Deprived ofconsumergoodsandluxuriesformanyyears, theyare eager toexperiment. WealthyChinese are younger(typical Audi buyersin Germanyare intheir50s; in China theyare in their30s),and hence more familiarwith technology.Because the carisnota cherished culturalicon asitisin America, localsare not ad-dicted to drivingand are open to alterna-tive formsofmobilitysuch asride-sharing. Thathasbeen a boon to Didi. With a re-ported valuation of$50bn, itisthe world’smostvaluable startup afterUber. This isthanksto an injection earlierthisyear of$5.5bn, the biggest-everfundinground for ayoungtech ﬁrm, bya group led byJapan’sSoftBank.

With Tencentasa partner, he can ex-pectaccessto data collected byWeChat, itsmessaging-and-paymentsapp with about1bn users. IthelpsthatChinese consumersare more relaxed than Westernersaboutsharingpersonal data. The Chinese gov-ernment’ssupportive stance on “precisionmedicine” isuseful, too.Otherineﬃcientstate-dominated in-dustriesare beingupended. China’slogis-ticssectorwasroughlyequal to 15% ofGDPin 2016, costliereven than in Brazil or India.Manyofthe lorriesowned byindividualsmissouton jobsbecause theylackinfor-mation aboutpotential newloads. This ischangingfast. “OurtargetmarketistentimesasbigasDidi’s,” calculatesRichardZhang, the ﬁnance chiefofHuochebang, alogistics-technologyunicorn. He estimatesthatthe empty-load rate in China is40%,well above the American level. Huoche-bang’sonline marketplace matchesdriverswith loadsatno charge (though he expectsthisservice to become the main earneronce the ﬁrm startslevyingfees). It also of-ferslorrysalesand leasing, insurance andﬁnancial services. MrZhangvowsto goglobal in the future.Olderﬁrmsoften stuckwith the famil-iarhome market, butthe bestnewones areborn global and have the world in theirsights. Manyhave founderseducatedabroad; othersare backed byforeign ven-ture capitalists. Edward Tse, an expert onChinese innovation, arguesthatlocal start-upshave world-classpeople and technol-ogyattheirdisposal: “Theyknowmuchmore aboutwhatisgoingon in Silicon Val-leyorIsrael than do Europeans.”MrLee reckonsthe country’svastandgrowingmarket, itsurban hyper-densityand itslegionsoftech-hungryand free-spendingyoungpeople provide a betterprovingground foraspiringglobal entre-preneursthan do the stagnantmarkets ofthe developed world. He isconvinced thatChina hasthe mostindustriousentrepre-neursand the boldestventure capitalistsanywhere. Asa result, he insists, China’swinners“will inherita decentportion ofthe world market.”China’snewentrepreneursare clearlyon the ascendancybutthere are plenty ofwaysin which theycould yetstumble.Outside factorssuch asa sharp recessionorbankingcrisiscould lead to a panickyventure-capital bust.

But20% ofNewZealanderssaythere are toomanyvisitors—up from 13% who said thatin 2015.NewZealand’spristine image hasalso boosted the dairy in-dustry. ManyChinese consumers, in particular, choose Kiwi in-fantformula overdomesticbrands, which theyfearwill be con-taminated. Overthe past15 orso years, sheep farmshave beenconverted to dairy, and familyfarmssnapped up bycorpora-tions—the so-called Queen Streetfarmers, named afterAuck-land’smain commercial drag.

Thispolluteswatercoursesand ﬁllslakes with al-gal blooms, despite newrequirementsto fence streamsoﬀ fromlivestock. Some rivershave become too polluted to swim in.Nitratesand microbesfrom faecesalso seep into aquifers thatsupplydrinkingwaterin some places. The cityofChristchurch,ravaged byan earthquake in 2011, liesto the north ofthe Canter-buryPlains, where dryland farmshave given wayto heavily wa-tered dairyoperations.

Thehighestrate thatyearwasin Guangxi, aprovince in the south borderingVietnam,where the fertilityrate was1.79. Both ratesare belowthe replacementlevel. ButGuangxi’sfertilityistwo-and-a-half timesso have relativelyfewrural dwellers. Thisisthe largestcategory, with 600m people. 3. Provinceswith fertilityratesbetween1.3 and 1.49. Many, such asHenan, Hunanand Anhui, are justinland from the coast.They, too, are populous(460m in total) andmostlyHan buthave fewercity-dwellers:more than halfofthe populationsofHu-nan and Anhui isrural. Thisgroup also in-cludesseveral provinceswith lotsof mem-bersofminorities, such asNingxia, in thenorth-west, which isa third Muslim.4. Areaswith ratesabove 1.5, whichtend both to be more rural and to have bigminoritypopulations, such asGuangxi.These have a total population of116m.Since the one-child policywasin forceso long, diﬀerencesin fertilityhave be-come entrenched and theirimpactpro-found. To take one example, provinceswith relativelylowfertilitytend to have aneven biggerexcessofboysovergirls than isthe norm. Nationally, the imbalance hasebbed somewhatsince 2000, with the sexratio atbirth fallingfrom 121boysforevery100 girlsin 2005 to 114 in 2015. Butin thenorth-eastthere hasbeen little orno im-provement—a worryconsideringthe highlevelsofcrime associated with large num-bersofunmarried men (called “barebranches” in China).Fertilityisnotthe onlyforce pushingprovincial demographyin diﬀerentdirec-tions. The migration ofmore than 245mworkersfrom poor, rural areasto boomingcitiesampliﬁesthe diﬀerence in fertility insome placesand counteractsitin others.In the decade before 2010 the popula-tion ofChongqing, a large urban provincein the west, fell by2m (or6%); in neigh-bouringSichuan itfell by3m. Birthsex-ceeded deathsin both placesoverthe per-iod, so the population should have grown.Butthiswasoﬀsetbythe outﬂowofmi-grants. Cai Yongofthe Universityof North higherthan Beijing’s, which isa widerspread than the one separatingthe stateswith the highestand lowestfertility in Bra-zil, and onlya little lessthan the equivalentgap in India. The main reason isthat, in practice, theone-child policywasneveruniform. Eth-nicminorities, such asTibetansorUighurs(the largestgroup in the western provinceofXinjiang), were neversubjectto it. Mi-norities, who accountfor8% ofthe popula-tion nationwide, were usuallyallowedtwo children in urban areasand three orfourin rural ones. In addition, in most ruralareas, everyone, includingthe majorityHan group, wasallowed two children.Degrees ofdwindlingAsa resultChina hasfourcategories offer-tility, notone (see map on nextpage):1. Areasofultra-lowfertility(rates oflessthan 1). These are three mega-cities,Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, and threeprovincesin the north-east, sometimescalled Manchuria, where the one-childpolicywasapplied moststrictly. They haveatotal population of170m.2. Areaswhere fertilityisbetween 1and1.29. These include provinceson China’spopulouscoastline, aswell asthe huge Si-chuan basin in western China.

The combination ofmigration and va-ryingfertilitymeansthatprovincesareageingatdiﬀerentspeeds. The median agenationallyrose from 25 in 1990 to 35 in 2010;ithad increased to 37 by2016. Butthe threenorth-eastern provincesall aged byevenmore than average. In Liaoningthe medianage reached 39.2 in 2010, aboutthe same asRussia. In contrast, the median age in Tibet,the youngestprovince, is27.8, aboutthesame asIndia.Ageingmattersbecause pension provi-sion ispartlya provincial responsibility inChina. The value ofthe basicstate pensionisﬁxed nationally, butprovincesset theirown contribution rates, administerthemoneycollected and distribute the pen-sions. Howheavya burden thisisdependson a province’sdemography. Asa rule, thelowerthe fertilityrate, the fasterthe rise inthe dependencyratio (the numberofpen-sionersrelative to the numberofworkingpeople). In relativelyfecund Guizhou andYunnan, the ratio isstill falling. In Beijingand Shanghai, itrose bymore than fourpercentage pointsbetween 2010 and 2015,more than the national average.Giantcitiessuch asBeijing, Shanghaiand Tianjin have ultra-lowfertilityandfast-risingdependencyratiosyetare stillable to attractyoungworkersbecause Chi-na’shighest-payingjobsare clusteredthere. Asa result, theirdemographic proﬁleishealthierthan youwould expect. Thethree cities, which have provincial-levelstatus, are China’sfastest-growingprov-incesbypopulation, increasingbyaround3% a yearin 2000-10, thankslargelyto mi-gration. Since the migrantsare mostlyyoung, the cities’ median agesrose muchmore slowlythan the national average andtheirdependencyratiosremain relativelylow. And since the citiesare also rich, theyhave hospitals, social servicesand schoolsto cope with theirdemographicproblems. Provinceswith high fertilityand out-ward migration are the opposite. Take Hai-nan, a tropical island in the farsouth. Ithashigh fertility(byChinese standards) andstable dependency. Itoughtto be doingwell.

The national governmenthasagrand policyto help the region called “thenorth-eastrevitalisation plan”, butasoneofthe articlesnoted, the region’sdemo-graphiccrisisisneverdiscussed.Nowcompare thatwith Guangdongatthe otherend ofthe country, nextto HongKong. On the face ofit, China’slargestprov-ince, with a population of108m, also facessevere problems. Itsfertilityrate was re-ported to be 1in 2010, more than in thenorth-eastbutstill alarminglylow. Yet itspopulation rose more quicklyin 2000-10than anyotherprovince exceptthe threehuge cities. Itsmedian age isﬁve years be-lowthatin the north-east.

This issigniﬁcantsince almostall migrants rent,notown, theirhouses.Unlike in Guangzhou, the national au-thoritieshave been slowto recognise theproblemsofdemographicdecline.

The three greatcities lookrelativelyhealthy, asdo GuangdongandZhejiang, a nearbyprovince thatsharessome ofitsfeatures.

Itattracted no co-sponsors. On September13th he intro-duced a similarbill. Sixteen Democraticsenators—one-third ofthe party’sSenatecaucus—signed on asco-sponsors, includ-ingCoryBooker, Elizabeth Warren, KirstenGillibrand and Kamala Harris, all potentialpresidential candidates.In the interveningfouryearsMrSand-ers’sproposal hasgrown no more feasible.In an interviewwith Vox, an online newsoutlet, HillaryClinton, who defeated MrSandersforthe nomination, raised thesame objectionsshe had lastyear: his planistoo vague, expensive and politically na-ive. ButDemocratstodayare in no moodforcaution; enraged and energised in op-position, theyhave taken a maximalistturn. Some single-payersupportersfreelyconcede thatthe bill haslittle chance ofpassingsoon, butbelieve itisbetter to takeabold position and getpushed, bycircum-stance ornegotiation, backtowardsthecentre than to startthere. Thatisa soundmobilisation strategy. Butthe goal of partypoliticsisnotmobilisation; itisvictory,and the party’scentristwing, quietas itisnow, worriesthatfull-throated progressiv-“passive, old and notagile enough…Wedon’twantto take ordersfrom them. Wehave more powerasoutsiders.” Forsome,the bruisesfrom lastyear’sDemocraticprimaryremain sore. Jude-Laure Denis ofPOWERNortheast, a faith-based progres-sive group active in Pennsylvania, ex-plains, “In 2016 the partydecided itknewbetterthan the people. When youdo that,youbreakyourbase.” Thisisa familiarcomplaintfrom back-ersofMrSanders(like MsDenis). Some ofthem believe the contestwasrigged in MrsClinton’sfavour. Itwasnot—MrSanderslostbecause he received lesssupport—bute-mailsfrom the DemocraticNationalCommittee (DNC) hacked byWikiLeaks re-vealed partyinsidersspeakingofthe up-startcandidate with contempt. One for-merstate-partychairman callshim “auniquelydestructive force”, more interest-ed in tearingthe partydown—he is, afterall, noteven a Democrat—than helping tobuild it.The newNewDealYetdespite hislossand the snarlsof thepartyfaithful, MrSanders’sinﬂuence mayprove more lastingthan MrsClinton’s.ManyDemocratsnowsupporta $15 mini-mum wage, anotherpriorityofMrSandersthatMrsClinton hesitated to embrace.

Thatapproach hasmoved the centreofAmerican politicseverrightward; pro-gressivessee markingoutsimilarpositionson the leftasa wayto push backand staketheirown claim. Boldnessralliespeople more than prag-matism. “People wantto be inspired,” saysNaomi Winch, presidentofthe EastPennDemocraticClub, an activistgroup. “Can-didateshave to liftpeople up...They have tobe brave.” Italso shiftsthe debate awayfrom social issues: a boon forDemocrats inRepublican states. Stephanie Taylor, whoheadsthe Progressive Change CampaignCommittee (PCCC), which supportspro-gressive candidatesand causes, saysthat ifyouhave a Democratrunningin such astate asa “corporate-friendlyRepublican-lite, the onlydistinction becomessocial is-sues. Then itbecomesa race entirely aboutabortion and guns…instead, ifthey’re pre-sentingan alternative vision aboutwhatgovernmentshould be doingforworkingpeople, then youhave a real choice.”Democratshave longshied awayfromfull-throated leftism, fearingitcould scareawaycentristvoters, changingthe calcula-tion. Butpolitical polarisation hasmadesuch votersscarce. Research byCorwinSmidtofMichigan State Universityshowsthatbetween 2000 and 2012 an average ofjust6.2% ofvoterspulled the leverfor a dif-ferentpolitical partyin two successivepresidential elections, with the lowest re-corded share (5.2%) comingin 2012—lessthan halfthe average rate (12%) between1952 and 1980. Turningoutthe partyfaith-ful thusseemsa surerroad to victory thanappealingto the vanishingcentre.Such talkmakescentristsnervous. WillMarshall, a longtime advocate forpro-business, conservative Democrats, hasstarted an advocacygroup thatwill even-tuallysproutpolitical-action committeesaimed atsupporting“a pragmaticwing[ofthe Democrats] thatcan be successful inmiddle America.” MrMarshall favourablycitesJohn Hickenlooper, Denver’sformermayornowservingasColorado’sgover-nor, asthe sortofpro-businessDemocratwho can win centriststateswhile notalienatingprogressives. MrHickenlooper’sapprenticeship and job-trainingpro-grammesare laudable; he seesthem as“the essence ofDemocraticpolicy, which isprovidingopportunityforeveryone.That’swhatwe should be talkingabout.”PlentyofDemocratshave begun testing“opportunity” phrases. Tim Ryan, a con-gressman from Ohio who challenged Nan-cyPelosi forthe DemocraticHouse leader-ship, saysthatDemocratsmustbe “thepartyofgrowth and opportunity”. MattBennettofThird Way, a centristthink-tank,usesthe phrase “opportunityto earn”—meaningthatDemocratsshould focuslesson addressinginequalityofoutcomesthrough redistribution than on makingsure the playingﬁeld isaslevel as possible,nottilted in favourofbigcompanies orpeople born lucky.Equal opportunistsThispitch could appeal to both populistsand moderates. Itoﬀersa unifying, for-ward-lookingstory, which MrObama alsoprovided asa candidate, ratherthan MrsClinton’sscoresoftargeted micro-policiesthatneverquite cohered into a whole. Italso oﬀerscross-racial appeal. Non-whites,who comprise an increasingshare ofAmericans, overwhelminglyvote Demo-cratic. Democratswantto keep itthat way,so callsto abandon “identitypolitics”—todownplayimmigration and racial-justiceconcerns, forinstance—will fall on deafears. Butequal opportunityisa malleableand forward-lookingrubricthatcouldhave widerappeal, and itprovidesa tidycontrastwith the revanchistundertones of“Make America GreatAgain”.Thatonlygoesso far, however. In muchofthe countrythe party’sbrand istoxic.Democratshold fewcongressional seatsoutside bigcities, and control no state-housesin the South; theyhold justthreeawayfrom the coasts. MsTaylorofthePCCCran focusgroupsin Maine and SouthCarolina. She laments: “Issue byissue,people would hearourcandidatesandlove them, butwhen theyheard theywereDemocratstheywould justshutdown.” Asthe Democratshave grown into a partydominated byurban professionalsandethnicminorities—two groupsofpeoplewhose futureslookbrighterthan theirpasts—the party’sabilityto speakto peoplewho are leftbehind haswaned. In 2016, ac-cordingto Nate SilverofFiveThirtyEight, awebsite providingquantitative analysis ofsportand politics, MrsClinton improvedon MrObama’sstrongperformance inAmerica’s50 most-educated counties, butcollapsed in the 50 least. In three special House electionsheldthisyearto replace congressmen nominat-ed to MrTrump’scabinet, Democratsrancandidatessuited to theirdistricts: a but-toned-down striverin Atlanta’srichersub-urbs, a quirkypopulistfolk-singerin Mon-tana and a pro-gun veteran in Kansas. Theyoutperformed expectationsin districtslongabandoned to Republicans, butstilllost—largelybecause Republicanssuccess-fullytied them to reviled national ﬁguressuch asMsPelosi, with whom theyhad lit-tle in common otherthan partyidentiﬁca-tion. Thissuggeststhatdetoxifyingthepartywill be hard.ButDemocratsdisagree abouthowmuch theyshould compromise. John BelEdwards, forinstance, isa pro-life, pro-gunDemocratservingasgovernorofdeeplyRepublican Louisiana—the onlyDemocrat-icgovernorin the Deep South. Acandidatewho sounded and voted like a coastal lib-eral would notwin there. The Republicans’rightward drifton abortion, pursuing poli-ciesthatrestrictaccessto birth control aswell, leavesthe centre wide open forDemocrats. And indeed, even some promi-nentsteadfastsupportersofabortion sayprivatelythat, while theywould preferpro-choice candidates, winninga congres-sional majorityismore important. Ben RayLuján, a congressman from NewMexicowho headsthe DemocraticCongressionalCampaign Committee (DCCC), setoﬀaﬁrestorm when he vowed notto withholdfundingfrom candidateswho opposeabortion choice. Supportforithaslongbeen in the party’splatform. Some Demo-cratsargue thatsuch compromise betraysthe party’svaluesand producesa weaker,lessstable coalition.Democratsare so united in theirloath-ingofthe presidentthattheycan aﬀordsome divisionsoverpolicy. In fact, theirchancesforvictoryin 2018 and 2020 maywell depend on whethertheycan rejectthe energisingthrill ofpurity-seeking andappeal to the countryasa whole. That ishowMrObama won power. MrTrump, ofcourse, tookanotherpath. Butitwill doAmerica no good ifDemocratstake thewronglesson from the wrongpresident.7The EconomistSeptember23rd2017 UnitedStates311AFTERRepublicansfailed to agree on areplacementforthe Aﬀordable CareActearlierthisyear, the cause ofObama-care repeal looked dead. Yeta revival wasalwayspossible before September30th,when a budgetmeasure allowinga healthbill to passthe Senate with only51votes,ratherthan 60, expires. The tickingclockhasspurred fourRepublican senators, ledbyBill CassidyofLouisiana and LindseyGraham ofSouth Carolina, to have one laststab atgettinga bill passed.MessrsCassidyand Graham are notbrimmingwith newpolicyideas. InsteadofreformingObamacare themselves, theywantto passthe baton to state govern-ments. Like pastRepublican bills, their pro-posal would limitthe federal govern-ment’srole in Medicaid (health insuranceforthe poor) to providinga ﬁxed grant tothe statesforeach person enrolled. Thenewbill extendsthatapproach to the indi-vidual market, in which 17m people whodo notgethealth insurance from some oth-ersource buyitforthemselves. From 2020,the federal fundsthatcurrentlysubsidisepoorerbuyerswould instead be divviedup amongstatesin proportion to the distri-bution ofAmericansearningbetween 50%and 138% ofthe federal povertyline. Statescould spend thiscash on health care most-lyastheysawﬁt. Theycould also opt outofmanyofObamacare’sregulations, such asthose preventinginsurersfrom chargingmore to those who are unhealthy. Federalism ofthiskind isoften desir-able. Widespread experimentation withhealth policywould surelylead to innova-tion, includingin waysDemocratsmightlike: statescould decide to provide univer-sal taxpayer-funded coverage, forexample.Yetthere are three cleardownsidesto theCassidy-Graham plan.First, statesmightnotbe up to the task.Each would have two yearsto decide whatitshealth-care system should looklike, andto ﬁnd the moneyto top up the federalgrantifnecessary. By2026 almosteverystate facesa cutcompared with whatit canexpectundercurrentlaw, accordingto theCentre forBudgetand PolicyPriorities, aleft-leaningthink-tank. The more a state’sresidentshave enrolled in Obamacare’sprogrammes, the harderitwill be to main-tain the statusquo, especiallyin places inpoorﬁscal shape, such asIllinoisor NewJersey. Anystate keepingObamacare’sreg-ulationsin place would riskactingas amagnetforAmericanswith chronichealthconditions, furtherraisingcosts. States’ re-cord here isnotgood: before Obamacare,manyran “high-riskpools” to care forthesick, buttheywere badlyunderfunded.Second, the bill would concentraterisks. Were a state to face a fresh drug epi-demicoroutbreakofdisease, itwould getno additional money. Bycontrast, Obama-care’ssubsidiesrise and fall automaticallyin proportion to local health costs. MrGraham arguesthatthe spread ofmoneyacrossstateswould neverthelessbe fairer, because California, NewYork,Massachusettsand Maryland currentlyre-ceive 40% ofall funding. Thiscriticismmakeslittle sense. California and NewYorkgeta lotofmoneyin partbecause theyare large. Forthe same reason, Florida andTexaseach getmore cash than eitherMas-sachusettsorMaryland, which MrGra-ham haspicked fortheirDemocraticpoli-tics.The stateswhich missouton cash arethose thathave notexpanded Medicaid orenrolled asmanypeople in the individualmarket. Accordingto ourcalculations,NewMexico, a state whose residentsare inrelativelypoorhealth, getsthe most Oba-macare fundingperhead (see chart).The ﬁnal problem with the bill is thatitdoestoo little to ﬁxthe immediate pro-blemsailingObamacare’smarkets: risingpremiumsand a lackofinsurers. In fact, itwould probablymake these problemsworse, byscrappinga requirementthatpeople buyhealth insurance orpaya ﬁne,therebyallowinghealthypeople to ﬂee themarket. Stateswould have to deal with thefalloutatthe same time asconstructingtheirown systemsin time for2020.SenatorCassidysayshisbill does notpreclude a bipartisan attemptto shore upthe individual market. Butan eﬀortto ﬁndsuch a compromise collapsed on Septem-ber20th. Insurersmustsign contractsgo-verningpremiumsin the individual mar-ketbySeptember27th.

After ﬁn-ishinghisstudiesatthe Universityof Geor-gia’sSchool ofAgriculture in 1976, MrHar-risdeployed all the instrumentsin his newtoolkitto increase hisfarm’sproﬁts: chemi-cal fertilisers, pesticides, land tillage, anti-biotics, hormones. Theydid wondersforcost-savings, he says, butmade him in-creasinglyuncomfortable. White OakPas-tures, hisfarm in western Georgia, hascome full circle over150 years. Trans-formed into an industrialised, commodi-tised and centralised agricultural opera-tion, the farm hasnowreverted to waysthathisgrandfathermightrecognise.

Around 15,400 tonnesa year, awhopping80% ofall antibioticssold, go tofarmers. Chicken farmersuse even morethan those who raise cattle orpigs.

Mostofthese illnessesare caused byantibiotic-re-sistantbacteria, and mostofthatbacteriacomesfrom industriallyproduced chicken.One villain in MsMcKenna’saccountisThomasJukes, a British biologist, who in1948 tested diﬀerentsupplements, includ-ingone with antibiotics, in the diets ofchickens.

On September11th MrOuda’sbrother, Khalid, criticised hisarrest onTwitter: “Ithasrevealed the size ofthe dem-agoguerywe enjoy.” The authoritiessoonrounded him up, too.The kingdom’smotives, asever, areopaque. The arrestscame ahead ofSep-tember15th, when a loose coalition of ac-tivistshad called forproteststo demandmore political freedom. The appointeddate came and wentquietly—in partbe-cause ofa heavypolice presence on citystreets. Saudi oﬃcialshinted thatit wasaforeign plotorganised bythe banned Mus-lim Brotherhood; one commentatorcalledthe arrestsa “campaign to cleanse state in-stitutions”. Social media were abuzzwithrumoursthatKingSalman, 81, wasplan-ningto abdicate.Until thissummer, the king’sdesignat-ed successorwasMuhammad bin Nayef, arespected ex-interiorminister. Butin Junethe kingupended the orderofsuccessionand installed hisown son, Muhammadbin Salman (orMBS, ashe iscalled), asheir.Just32, he assumed hisﬁrstbigpublic rolein 2015, when he became defence minister.Since then he hasoverseen a ruinouswarin neighbouringYemen and organised aboycottofQatar, which Saudi Arabia ac-cusesofsupportingterroristsand beingtoo cosywith Iran.

He wantsto reduce its de-pendence on oil, cutgeneroushandoutsand sell oﬀpartofSaudi Aramco, the state-owned energygiant, to create a sovereignwealth fund (see page 53). He also wants toloosen the strictureson Saudi culture—openingcinemas, forexample, in a king-dom where theyare banned. These arecontroversial changes. Theyhave forcedpampered Saudisto tighten theirbelts andinfuriated religiousconservatives. One ofthe men arrested thismonth, Essam al-Za-mil, had written criticallyabouttheAramco plan.Forall hisambition, MBShasbeen no-ticeablyvague on one issue: politics. Politi-cal partiesare banned in Saudi Arabia andspeech isrestricted. He hasshown no inter-estin changingthat. MrOuda ishardly thekingdom’smosttraditional voice; dozensofotherclericspose a biggerthreat to thecrown prince’scultural reforms. Yettheyremain free. “The onlydiﬀerence theyhaveisthattheybelieve in total obedience to theruler, and see thatasa religiousduty,” saysJamal Khashoggi, a veteran Saudi journal-ist. MrOuda doesnot. He wasa leader ofthe Sahwa(awakening) in the 1990s, an Is-lamistmovementthatpushed forpoliticalchanges. Decadeslater, he wrote a bookthatpraised the Arab revolutionsof2011(itwasbanned).Some ofthe detaineeswill probably bereleased. And the crackdown maynotbenecessary: apartfrom some grousingonsocial media, there hasbeen little dissentoverthe crown prince’spolicies. “Nobodyischallenginghim. The Saudi newspapersare full ofpraise forhiseﬀorts,” saysMrKhashoggi, who fearshe too mightbe ar-rested ifhe returnsfrom America. “It’sjustanotherimpulsive action.” 7Politics in Saudi ArabiaThe pricklyprinceCAIROMuhammad bin Salman cracks downon his perceived opponentsPrince Muhammad spots a criticIfviolence doesﬂare, Kirkukmay bewhere itstarts.

Theprovince’sKurdish governorinsiststhat atrench and three-metre-high earthen wall,erected with Western assistance to keep ISout, will serve to repelthe militias. Never-theless, he hassummoned Peshmerga re-inforcements.

Catalan governments, fortheir part,have spentmuch on thingslike subsidisedlocal media and foreign “embassies”.Catalansalso complain thattheygetlessthan theirdue in publicinvestment.

Spanish governmentshave fol-lowed an investmentpolicythat, he says,has“probablybeen too redistributive atthe expense ofeﬃciency”, partlybecauseofEU fundingmechanisms.The third, lesstangible, gripe concernsidentity. Accordingto MrMascarell, societyisfed up with “permanentand stupidquarrelsagainstthe Catalan language”.Catalan governmentshave educated twogenerationsofyoungstersin the historical-lyquestionable notion thatCatalonia isanancientnation-state oppressed bySpain. Behind the supportforthe referendumliesa sense ofinsecurity. Catalanslike tosee themselvesasa highlyadvanced partofa backward country. Thisisno longer astrue asitwas. The restofSpain has caughtup. In 1962 income perperson in Cataloniawas50% above the national average; nowCatalonia’sisonly19% higher, according toMrde la Fuente.In thatsense, Catalan nationalism re-ﬂectsthe fearoflossofrelative status, alsoembodied byItaly’sNorthern League andotherright-wingpopulistmovements.

MrMiesikowski, a studentfrom Poland, washaulingventilation pipesacrossconstructionsitesratherthan sunninghimselfon the Riviera, buthe isnotcomplaining. Two monthsworkingin France earned him enoughto supportan entire yearofhisphysiotherapystudiesin Poznan. Like almosthalfa million ofhiscompatriots, MrMiesikowskiwastakingadvantage ofthe European Union’sruleson “postedworkers”, designed to govern payand beneﬁtswhen a citizenfrom one European countrytakestemporaryworkin another.The Polish agencythatemployed him arranged hisworkwithFrench clients, covered histransportand housingcosts and or-ganised a three-weeklanguage course before he left. Posted work-erspaysocial securityathome ratherthan in theircountry ofwork. Theiremployersare obliged to paythem onlythe basicminimum wage in the hostcountry, ratherthan the often higher“sectoral” wage. Bymostestimatestheymake up lessthan 1% ofthe EUlabourforce (farmore Europeanschoose to workabroadpermanently). The rulescoveringtheiremploymentare com-plex, arcane and tedious. Yettheyhave become the subject ofabitterrowamongEurope’sleaders. To simplifya little, a coalition ofwealthyEUcountries, led byFrance, believesthe currentrulesencourage “social dumping”(cheap foreign workersundercuttinglocal ones), and wants totighten the conditionsofposted work. “Equal payforequal workin the same place” istheirmantra. The poorercountriesof easternEurope retortthatthese piouswordsare a coverforold-fashionedprotectionism. On joiningthe EU theyhad to open up to westernEuropean goodsand capital; whyshould theirservice providersnowbe locked outofhigh-wage markets? On inspection, most“east-west” conﬂictsinside the EUturnoutto be rathermore variegated. Butthisone cleavesthe conti-nentmore orlessin two, and hasbeen inﬂamed bythe odd deci-sion ofEmmanuel Macron, France’snewpresident, to place re-form ofposted workatthe heartofhisEU policy. Lastmonth,duringa tourofeastern Europe, he called the rules“a betrayal ofthe fundamental aspectsofthe spiritofEuropean legislation”. Hescuppered a proposal to revise the lawin June, and insiders sayhisapproach hasmade strikinga compromise harder. (Some inBritain notyetreconciled to Brexitwonderifcommon cause canbe made with MrMacron to limitimmigration byEU workers. Fatchance: in 2015 Britain registered barely50,000 posted workers,so little reliefwould be available thatway.)Rowsoversocial standardshave a longhistoryinside the EU,butwere bound to intensifywhen the club expanded to tenpoorercountriesin the 2000s. Incomesin the eastand westhavenotconverged asquicklyassome hoped, and the incentives forworkerslike MrMiesikowski are no puzzle: France’sminimumwage isthree timesashigh asPoland’s. Some sectorsare highlyexposed. Byone estimate, posted workersaccountforone-thirdofthe labourforce on construction sitesin Belgium (where la-bourtaxesare eye-watering). KrisPeeters, the deputyprime min-ister, saysthatBelgian workershave been locked outof local jobsand thatsmallerﬁrms, which cannoteasilyhire posted workers,struggle to compete. Butlegitimatelyemployed posted workersare greatlyoutnumbered bythe unregistered orfraudulent sort. Ifsocial dumpingisa problem, attackingposted workersdoes notlooklike much ofa solution. So whyall the fuss? Some argue thatvotersaghastat seeingtheirlegal protectionssupposedlyundercutbyforeigners will betempted bypolitical extremism. “Some partiesare veryanti-European, and one reason isthatso farwe have no solution forthe postingofworkers,” saysMrPeeters. MrMacron sharesthisview. He haspinned the blame forBritain’svote to leave the EUon “workersfrom eastern Europe who came to take British jobs”.Rich countriesthatchoose to erectbarriersto cheaper workersfrom foreign countriesmightsimplyend up importingmore oftheirgoodsoroﬀshoringproduction, pointsoutBruegel, a Brus-sels-based think-tank.

Some accuse the presidentofmakingscapegoatsof for-eign workersto help smooth the passage ofa contentious labourreform he ispushingathome. Whyelse would a newlymintedhead ofstate with a longto-do listdevote so much energy to anissue thatshould be the preserve ofmiddle-rankingministers?The EU’sgovernmentsare hopingto reach a compromise inOctober. Two French proposalsremain assticking-points: to re-duce the time limitforpostingto 12 months, and to include lorrydriversin the newlegislation.MrMacron hasthe backingofGer-many, Italyand others. Poland remainsan implacable foe, butitsirascible governmenthasfewfriendsin the EU; MrMacron’sdip-lomaticeﬀortswith more conciliatorygovernments, like those ofSlovakia and the Czech Republic, maybearfruit. Anychangesto the lawwill be symbolic, notleastbecause theaverage posted workertoilsforwell undera year. Buthaving ded-icated himselfto thisobscure ﬁght, MrMacron needsa win ashepreparesforthe biggerbattle to come, overreform ofthe eurozone. Hiscallsfora “Europe thatprotects” resonate with thosewho blame an excessofAnglo-American deregulatoryzeal forfu-ellingpopulism in the EU.

Aidesfrom the Miliband era recallpainstakinglymovingmoneyaround tofree up £2.5bn ofextra fundingforthe NHS.MrCorbyn promisesan extra £30bn by,amongotherthings, raisingincome tax forthe top 5% ofearners.Brexit, coupled with seven yearsof aus-terity, mayhave washed awayvoters’squeamishnessaboutpublicspendingbyaLabourgovernment. “Ifyouare goingtopissaway£250bn byleavingthe singlemarket, another£11bn on [abolishing] tu-ition feesdoesn’tmatter,” saysTom Bald-win, a formeradviserto MrMiliband. “It’sanotherround ofdrinkson the Titanic.”ConsideringthatMrFisher, the man be-hind the manifesto, once labelled MrMili-band’scabinet“the mostabjectcollectionofabsolute shite”, the overlap in policies—from a crackdown on companiesthatarelate to paytheirsuppliers, to a higher mini-mum wage—isremarkable.Where MrCorbyn’spoliciesdo diﬀer isin theirclarity. Duringitslatestterm in gov-ernment, in 2005-10, Labourwasaddictedto technocratic, targeted solutions. Policiessuch astaxcredits—wage top-upsforthelow-paid—were eﬀective butincompre-hensible. In contrast, MrCorbyn proposes“bright, primary-colourpolicies”, saysMarcusRobertsofYouGov. Ideassuch asscrappingtuition feesand providingfreelunchesforprimaryschool pupilsare clearand understandable, even iftheymakewonkswail atthe thoughtofsprayingmoneyatthe middle class. The tactic isworking. Some 28% ofLabourvoterscitethe party’spoliciesasthe main reason forbackingit, accordingto YouGov. FortheConservatives, the numberisjust10%.Criticsargue thatthe programme is stilldated, harkingbackto a 1970sBritain. Yet aplanned hike in corporation tax, to 26%,would putitbackto nearwhere itwas atthe startofDavid Cameron’stenure, in2010. Tuition feeswere introduced only in1998. The privatisation ofthe railways be-gan onlyin 1994. “People can be veryahis-torical aboutthese things,” saysMrMili-band. MostofLabour’spolicieswould notlookoutofplace in the programme of atypical centre-leftpartyin northern Eu-rope. “It’sunradical in the grand scheme ofhistory,” saysMrRussell-Moyle, the Brigh-ton MP. “Butit’sradical in the here andnowofBritish politics.”Can Labourgo the distance?

Itprovided an electoral life-jacketin 2010, when Labourwon 41of59seatsthere, even asitwashammered southofthe border. The rise ofthe Scottish Na-tional Partychanged all that. Labour nowhasjustseven Scottish seats, behind boththe SNPand the Tories. Rebuildingthisbase will be a slog. ButLabourmade gainsin Scotland earlierthisyear, and now eyes20 Scottish seatswhere itisfewerthan4,000 votesawayfrom victory.In England, some in the partyfear thatMrCorbyn’sappeal istoo narrow, particu-larlyin the post-industrial townsacrossthe midlandsand partsofthe north whereLabourisalreadystrugglingto hold seats.MrCorbyn still repelsa lotofvoters: thepartyitselfismore popularthan its leader,accordingto YouGov. An unknown num-berofpeople voted forLabourin June onlybecause theywere conﬁdenthe would notbecome prime minister.

All thismeansthatplentyofLabourMPsretainsome scepticism aboutthe Corbyn project.ButLabour’sleadership isgettingbetteratsideliningpotential saboteurs.

Atabout thesame time Tories“R” Us, one ofthe biggestplayersin Britain’spo-litical market, wasdoingeverythingpossible to prove that itisheadingin the same direction. Votersdislike nothingmore than apartyatwarwith itself. The Torieswentto waroverthe mostim-portantproblem facingthe country—one thatislargelyof theirown making.BorisJohnson, the foreign secretary, ignited the conﬂict with alengthyarticle on Brexitin the DailyTelegraph, a weekbefore The-resa Maywasdue to give a bigspeech on the same subject in Flor-ence. AmberRudd, the home secretary, accused him of“back-seatdriving”. SirDavid Norgrove, Britain’schiefstatistician, criticisedhis“clearmisuse ofoﬃcial statistics” in revivingthe claim thatBrexitwould give Britain a windfall of£350m ($475m) a weektospend on the National Health Service. In MrJohnson’sdefenceJacob Rees-Mogg, a backbench Tory, suggested thathe should begiven a knighthood. AsThe Economistwentto pressMrJohnsonwaspreparingto demonstrate hisloyaltyto MrsMaybysitting inthe frontrowforherspeech, havingproclaimed, poetically, thatthe cabinetwasa “nestofsingingbirds”, asifvoterscannotdis-criminate between trillingnightingalesand hissingvipers. Whatdoesthissoap opera tell us, otherthan thatBritain isruled byan incestuousclique offrenemieswho delightin turningeven the mostseriousissuesinto melodramas? The mostobviousthingisthatBritain’sprime ministerisasweakasitispossible tobe while still residingin DowningStreet. MrJohnson challengedherauthorityon the mostfraughtissue in British politics ata pe-culiarlysensitive time butstill kepthisjob. SirVince Cable, theLiberal Democrats’ sharp-tongued leader, compared MrsMaytoaheadmistress“barricaded in herown oﬃce” forfearofunrulypupils. Thisdoesnotbode well fornegotiationswhich, iftheyareto succeed, will require MrsMayto persuade herpartyto sign oﬀon all sortsofconcessionsand trade-oﬀs. Still, in exposingMrsMay’sweakness, MrJohnson hasre-vealed hisown. Notso longago he wasthe Conservatives’leader-in-waiting. Hissuccessin gettinghimselfelected mayorofLondon—a left-leaningand multicultural city—proved that hepossessed “the Heineken factor”, refreshingpartsthatother To-riescould notreach. PartBertie Woosterand partJack the Lad, hewentdown well atboth Toryfetesand in cityboozers. Today he isreviled byliberalsand distrusted bymanypartyloyalists. Asmayor, he wasfrequentlyhailed asa hero when cyclingthroughthe city. Nowhe issubjectto abuse. Arecentpoll ofTory activistsaboutwho should be the nextleadergave him lessthan 8% ofthevote, well behind hisfellowWoosterimitator, MrRees-Mogg. Theresultisan impasse. The leaderofthe governmentistoo weaktoimpose herauthority; the leaderofthe hard-Brexitfaction ofherpartyistoo weakto depose her; and JeremyCorbyn, the hard-leftleaderofthe LabourParty, getseverstronger.Even more worryingly, the Johnson aﬀairrevealshowpoorlyBritain’spreparationsforBrexitare going. MrJohnson’scriticssuch asKenneth Clarke, a liberal Torygrandee, argue that the for-eign secretaryshould have obeyed the rulesofcollective cabinetresponsibility: ministersoughtto airtheirviewswithin the cabi-netand then defend the collective line. Butitturnsout thatMrsMayhasneverengaged in a bigcabinetdebate to determine theline. Instead she haslimited discussion to varioussubcommit-tees, from which MrJohnson waspointedlyexcluded. He wasdriven to write hisarticle because he thoughtthatthe govern-mentwasslouchingtowardsa “softBrexit” on the basisofsubter-fuge ratherthan open argument. The foreign secretaryhashighlighted the ﬁssure atthe heartofToryand British politics. Brexitinvolvesa trade-oﬀbetween whattechnocratscall “control” (meaningsovereignty) and “access”(meaningfreedom to trade with the EU). SoftBrexiteerssuch asPhilip Hammond, the chancellor, and MsRudd favouraccessovercontrol and a longtransition ratherthan a cliﬀ-edge Brexit.TheywantBritain to “shadow” the single marketbyobeyingmostofitsrules, includingthose againststrikingindependenttrade deals, foraslongaspossible. Theyhave the support ofmostbusinessleaders, who feardisruption more than anything else.Hard Brexiteerssuch asMrJohnson thinkthiswould make amockeryofBritain’sdecision to leave the EUin the ﬁrstplace.Theywanta relativelyshorttransition—MrJohnson hassuggest-ed sixto 12 months. Theypointto the factthatCanada hasa com-prehensive trade deal with the EUwithoutbeinga memberofthesingle marketand insistthat“no deal would be betterthan a baddeal” on the ground thatthe worstthatcan happen isthat Britainwill revertto World Trade Organisation rules. The central argu-mentin MrJohnson’smagnum opuswasthatBrexitisan oppor-tunityto be seized, butthatmostofthose in charge of implement-ingitsee itasa bomb to be defused.The greatbetrayalMrJohnson’stalkofoptimism betrayed also suggeststhe begin-ningofsomethingdarker: the stab-in-the-backtheoryof Brexit.Brexiteersare alreadyhard atworkexplainingwhytheir gloriousidea hasfailed to bearfruit. Brexitwasimplemented by itsene-miesratherthan itsfriends. MrsMaywastoo naive to take on EUoﬃcialswhose onlyconcern wasto see Britain humiliated. MrJohnson’sintervention thisweekhaspositioned him to revivehisleadership ambitionsasthe tribune ofthisstabbed-in-the-backfaction. The Tories’ agoniesoverBrexitnotonlymake itmore likelythatthe nextprime ministerwill be a hard-leftist whoblamesBritain’sproblemson the machinationsofinternationalcapital. Theyalso make itmore likelythatthe prime minister afterthatwill be a rightistwho blamesthe country’sproblemson themachinationsofclosetRemoanersand Eurocrats. 7AngrybirdsThe Conservatives are dangerouslydivided overBrexitBagehotThe EconomistSeptember23rd2017511IN2008 LouVincent, a formerNewZea-land international cricketer, wasplayingin a now-defunctIndian Twenty20 cricketleague.

China’sversion ismuch morehands-on. Bythe startofthisyear, oﬃcialshad established 1,013 “state-guided funds”,endowed with 5.3trn yuan ($807bn), muchofitfor“Made in China” industries.

Instead, local ﬁrms,insulated from head-on foreign competi-tion, have milked the jointventuresforproﬁtsand innovated little.Moreover, in theirzeal, local govern-mentscan go overboard. Some worrythat“Made in China” sectorswill end up facinggluts, like “old” industrieswhere China isnowcuttingovercapacity, such assteel andcoal. The MercatorInstitute ofChina Stud-ies, a Berlin-based research group, countedthat, bylate 2016, nearly40 local govern-mentshad opened orplanned roboticsparks. The central governmentestimatesthatChina will need nearly150bn yuan-worth ofrobotsoverthe nextfewyears.Accordingto the Mercatortally, local tar-getsadd up to roughlyﬁve timesasmuch.Yetwhen fourfactors—foreign technol-ogy, domesticabilities, marketdemandand governmentmoney—come together,Chinese industrial policycan be ruthlesslyeﬀective. The boom in high-speed rail be-gan in 2004 when the governmentoﬀeredlucrative contractsto foreign engineeringcompaniessuch asGermany’sSiemensand Japan’sKawasaki so longastheyshared theirknow-how.

Itaccountsformore than 10% ofdegreesawarded ateliteuniversitieseach year, byone estimate, and manymore studentstake an introductoryclassaspartoftheirgeneral-education re-quirements. Teachersofsuch coursesaim to grab the attention oftheirglassy-eyed audience, to acquaintstudentswith the basicsofthe subjectand, ideally, to equip them to applyeconomic rea-soningto the real world. Economicsteachesthatincentives mat-terand trade-oﬀsare unavoidable. Itshowshownaive attemptsto ﬁxsocial problems, from povertyto climate change, can haveunintended consequences. Introductoryeconomics, atits best,enablespeople to see the unstated assumptionsand hidden costsbehind the rosypromisesofpoliticiansand businessmen. Yetthe standard curriculum ishardlycalibrated to impartthese lessons. Mostintroductorytextsbegin with the simplest ofmodels. Workersare paid accordingto theirproductivity; tradenevermakesanyone worse oﬀ; and governmentinterventions inthe marketalwaysgenerate a “deadweightloss”. Practisingecon-omistsknowthatthese statementsare more true atsome timesthan others. Butthe all-importantexceptionsare taught quite latein the curriculum—or, often, onlyin more advanced courses takenbythose pursuingan economicsdegree. Otherdisciplines arealso taughtsimplyatﬁrst.

Theriskislow, however, thata studentwho dropsa physics coursewill thinkhe livesin a frictionlessvacuum.Studentspay$300 ormore fortextbooksexplainingthat incompetitive marketsthe price ofa good should fall to the costofproducingan additional unit, and unsurprisinglyregurgitate theexpected answers.

TheCORE project(forCurriculum Open-accessResources inEconomics) seeksto change all this. Itsprangfrom student prot-estsin Chile in 2011overthe perceived shortcomingsoftheir les-sons. AChilean professor, OscarLanderretche, worked with oth-ereconomiststo design a newcurriculum.

Thattextisthe basisofeconomics mod-ulestaughtbya small butgrowingnumberofinstructors.“The Economy”, asthe bookiseconomicallytitled, covers theusual subjects, butin a verydiﬀerentway. Itbeginswith the big-gestofbigpictures, explaininghowcapitalism and industrialisa-tion transformed the world, invitingstudentsto contemplatehowitarrived atwhere itistoday. Messycomplications, from en-vironmental damage to inequality, are placed ﬁrmlyin the fore-ground.

ThomasMalthus’sideasare used to teach stu-dentsthe usesand limitationsofeconomicmodels, combiningtechnical instruction with a valuable lesson from the history ofeconomicthought. “The Economy” doesnotdumb down eco-nomics; itusesmathsreadily, keepingstudentsengaged throughthe topicalityofthe material. Quite earlyon, students have les-sonsin the weirdnessin economics—from game theoryto powerdynamicswithin ﬁrms—thatmakesthe subjectfascinating anduseful butare skimmed overin mostintroductorycourses. Teachingthe COREcurriculum feelslike doinghonestwork,saysRajivSethi, ofBarnard College, who contributed to the COREtextbook. Academiceconomistsdo nothide from students thecomplicationstheygrapple with in theirown research. HomaZarghamee, also atBarnard, appreciateshavingto spend lesstime “unteaching”, ie, explainingto studentswhythe perfect-competition resulttheylearned doesnotactuallyhold in mostcases. Astudentwho doesnotﬁnish the course will not be leftwith a misleadingidea ofeconomics, she notes. Espritde COREEarlyresultsare promising. AssessmentsatUCLfound thatCOREstudentsperformed betterin subsequentintermediate coursesthan non-COREcounterparts. Anecdotally, atleast, studentsseem more engaged in COREcoursesand graduate assistants lesspained bythe prospectofteachingthem. The hopesforCOREare much more ambitiousthan simplyprovidingnon-economistsexposed to the material with a cleareridea ofwhateconomicsisall about. The newcurriculum mayalso help departmentsretain studentsdrawn to economics asawayto understand the world’sgreatchallenges, and notsimplyasa place to playwith elegantmodels.

Itwasa hyperbolicclaim, eventhen. Newresearch makesitseem evenmore ofone today. An analysispublishedin Nature Geoscienceon September18th, byRichard MillarofOxford Universityandhiscolleagues, suggeststhatclimate re-searchershave been underestimatingthecarbon “budget” compatible with the am-bitionsexpressed in Paris. Itmaybe possi-ble forthe world to emitsigniﬁcantly morecarbon dioxide in the nextfewdecadesthan waspreviouslythought, and still keepglobal warming“well below” a 2°Criseabove pre-industrial levels, which is whatthe agreementrequires. Itisthe total amountofcarbon dioxideemitted, ratherthan the rate atwhich itisemitted, which determineshowmuchgreenhouse warmingthe world will un-dergo. Thisallowsscientiststo draw upbudgetsthatquantifythe total emissionsassociated with a given temperature rise.In the mostrecentreportofthe Intergov-ernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) the carbon budgetfora good chanceofkeepingglobal warmingto 1.5°C—thepreferred targetofthe Parisagreement—was2.25trn tonnesofcarbon dioxide since1870.Estimatesofthe amountin factemit-fect, innerworkingsand resetthem all. Theresultwasa sizeable increase in the budget.The world could emitabout750bn tonnesofcarbon dioxide from 2015 onwardsandstill be “likely”—IPCCjargon fora two-thirdschance—to keep furtherwarmingbelow0.6°C. Given thatwarmingby2015was0.9°C, thistherefore deﬁnesthe budgetforstayingbelow1.5°C.To conﬁrm this, the researchersused adiﬀerenttype ofcomputermodel to look atfuturesin which emissionsare reducedsharplyfrom nowon, the climate respondsin the wayitseemsto have done in thepast, and the overall temperature rise islimited to 1.5°Corless. Theyfound itlikelythatthiscould be done with 920bn tonnesofpost-2015 carbon-dioxide emissions.Given the uncertaintiesinvolved, that isaprettyclose match to theirotherﬁgure.Again, the carbon budgetlastsa fewde-cades, notjusta fewyears. Underbudget?These resultsare controversial. Those whohave been sceptical aboutthe case forstrongaction on climate change have fall-en on them asevidence thatmodelssuchasthose used in CMIP5 have fundamentalﬂaws. Itistrue that, asDrMillarand histeam pointout, those modelsmayhaveoverestimated the coolingeﬀectsofsomepollutants, and thusofthe warmingthatwould be “unmasked” when those coolingpollutants, such assulphurfrom Chinesecoal-ﬁred powerstations, were reduced. Atthe same time, certain climate scien-tistshave raised questionsaboutthe Ox-ford work. Some have doubtsaboutthe“resetting” ofthe CMIP5 resultsto the mea-sured data for2015. Anotherworryisthat anumberofdiﬀerentdata setsclaim to traceglobal temperature from the 1870sto now. ted bythe time ofthe Parisagreement wereasmidgen over2trn tonnes, and annualemissionsatthe momentare almost40bntonnes. Thissuggested thatthe total car-bon budgetwould be spentbyabout2020.Hence MsFigueres’ alarm. The calculationson which thatIPCCbudgetwasbased—which were carried outin partbysome ofDrMillar’sco-authors—depended on the use ofa setofcomplexclimate modelscalled CMIP5 to replicatewhathad happened in the climate since1870 and assesswhatmighthappen in thecenturyto come. In the average ofthesemodels, which were run in the early2010s,cumulative emissionstookuntil a littleafter2020 to top 2trn tonnes(ie, severalyearsaftertheyactuallydid so). Also, thetemperature theypredicted would prevailatthattime wasabout1.2°Cabove thatof1870 when, in actual fact, the temperatureafter2trn tonneshad been emitted wasonly0.9°Chigher. In otherwords, the realworld had seen slightlymore carbon emit-ted, and lesswarming, than the modelshad suggested itshould have. The discrepancycaused DrMillartowonderwhatwould happen ifthe CMIP5resultswere shifted so thattheycentred onthe known temperature and cumulativecarbon-dioxide emissionsfor2015 ratherthan 1870—if, in otherwords, youtook a setofclockswith well-understood, ifimper-Carbon budgetsBreathingspaceChanged estimates ofhowmuch carbon dioxide can still be emitted to meetclimate targets leave no room forcomplacencyScience and technologyAlso in this section67Treating snake bites68Exploring the asteroid belt69Dental health69Academic sexismThe EconomistSeptember23rd2017 Scienceandtechnology6712The one DrMillarand hiscolleaguesusedisthatwith the smallestincrease. The setwhich showsthe largestincrease calcu-latesthe currenttemperature asbeing lessthan 0.4°Cshortofthe 1.5°Ctarget, ratherthan 0.6°C. Use this, and the newbudgetwould be signiﬁcantlysmaller. There are uncertainties, then, in bothmodelsand data, and no single studyshould be expected, ofitself, to reset theworld’splans. Even ifthe Oxford paper’snewbudgetswere copper-bottomedtruths, though, theywould hardlyprovidethe respite theymightseem to. No one ex-pected the constraintsofthe previous 1.5°Cbudgetto be met, and meetingthe newconstraintswould still be challenging. The pathwayswith happyoutcomesthatDrMillarand hiscolleaguesdescribein theirpaperhad netemissionsfalling tozero shortlyafterthe middle ofthe century.Thatrequiressteep emissionscutsto bemaintained fordecades. Ifthe processwere to starttoday, emissionswould haveto be cutby1.1bn tonnesofcarbon dioxideeveryyear. Ifcutsstarted later, they wouldhave to be steeperatsome point. Eventhen, bythe middle ofthe centurythe bud-getmightbe overspentin a waythatre-quired the deploymentoftechnologieswhich can suckCO2outofthe atmosphere,thusproducing“negative emissions” tobalance the books(see chart).One wayofdoingthiswould be to burnplantsinstead offossil fuelsin power sta-tions, and then store the resultingcarbondioxide underground.

Saw-scaled vipers, to give thegroup’scommon name, are found in Afri-ca, the Middle Eastand Asia. Theirvenommakesblood clot, bringingagonisingdeath. Victimsare often farm workers whosupportentire households, so an attackcan plunge a familyinto poverty. Antivenoms—chemicalsthatreverse orbluntthe eﬀectsofa snake’stoxin—arestandard medicinesin areaswhere bitesare common. Buta studyled byBryan Fryofthe UniversityofQueensland, in Aus-tralia, which hasjustbeen published inToxicologyLetters, hasfound a problem:againstmanysnake populations, thesemedicinesdo notwork. Antivenom production, which waspio-neered in the 19th centurybyAlbertCal-mette, a studentofLouisPasteur, involvesextractingvenom from snakesand inject-ingitinto animals, such ashorses, that can,thanksto theirsize, survive large doses ofthe stuﬀ. The injected animals’ immunesystemsproduce antibodiesthatneutral-ise the venom. These can be extracted andstored forlateruse on human victims.Nowadays, ratherthan producinga singleantivenom foreach type ofsnake, the ani-malsemployed to make the stuﬀare inject-ed with several diﬀerenttoxins, in thehope ofcreatingan antivenom eﬀectiveagainstthem all. Thismakessense. Mostvictimsofsnake biteswill notknowexact-lywhatbitthem. Butthe underlyingprinci-ple isthe same asCalmette’s.The antivenom approach does, though,depend on the venom injected into a vic-tim beingamongthose used to make thetreatment. DrFry, observingthe hugerangesofsome ofthe speciesinvolved,and the tendencyofevolution to result inlocal adaptationseven within such spe-cies, wondered whetherthatwasalwaystrue forexistingsnake-bite remedies.To ﬁnd out, he obtained venom fromsaw-scaled vipersin Ghana, India, Kenya,two regionsofMali, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sen-egal, Saudi Arabia and the United ArabEmirates. He and hiscolleaguesmeasuredthe rate atwhich venom from each ofthesecaused human blood to clot. Theythen re-ran the experimentin the presence of eachoffourdiﬀerentcommercial antivenoms,to see ifthese slowed the processdown.Two ofthe antivenomsin question, Echi-Tab-Plus-ICPand SAIMREchis, were madeusingvenom from African snakes. The oth-ertwo, Sii PolyvalentAnti-snake VenomSerum and Snake Venom Antiserum I.P.,were from Indian snake venoms. The bestofthe antivenoms, EchiTab-Plus-ICP, did well againsttoxinsused bythe vipersofGhana, Nigeria, one oftheMalian regionsand Senegal. Butitdid littleagainstall othersaw-scaled vipers, despitebeinglisted asa treatmentin Kenya and inthe region ofMali forwhich the experi-mentsuggested itdid notwork. SAIMREchiswassimilar.

Thisantivenom islisted aseﬀective against aspeciescalled Echiscarinatus(picturedoverleaf). ButDrFry’sresultssuggestthatprotection doesnotextend to populationsofthisspecieslivingin India. The makersofboth ofthese anti-venomshave been receptive to the ﬁnd-ings. Megan SaﬀerofSAVP, in Johannes-burg, the ﬁrm responsible forthe SAIMREchisantivenom, saysthatan eﬀortis nowunderwayto re-label thisantivenom sothatitwill be used onlyin regionswhere itistrulyeﬀective.

Both are listed asbeingeﬀectiveagainstIndian populationsofE. carinatus,butDrFry’sresultscall thisinto question. Rajendra Prabhu, chiefscientistat Vins-Bio, in Hyderabad, the ﬁrm thatmakesSnake Venom Antiserum I.P., saysthatthe“antiserum isgeospeciﬁcto neutralise ourIndian region speciesonly”, yetthe newﬁndingsdo notsupportthisclaim.

MissionssuchasCassini, a recentlyended explorationofSaturn and itsmoons, and NewHori-zons, a trip to Pluto and one ortwo moredistantobjectsin the farreachesof the so-larsystem, have involved launchingcraftweighinghundredsorthousandsofkilo-grams. Forbig, essentiallyunique targetssuch asthese, thatexpense hasprovedworthwhile. Butasexploration movesonto smallerand more numerousobjects,like asteroids, individual visitsatcosts ofhundredsofmillions, oreven billions ofdollarsare no longera feasible idea. Somesystem ofmassroboticspace travel needsto be devised. And Pekka Janhunen oftheFinnish Meteorological Institute in Helsin-ki thinkshe hasinvented one. In 2004 DrJanhunen putforward theidea ofa sail thatharnessesthe solar wind,astream ofcharged particlesemanatingfrom the sun which manifestsitselfonEarth in the dramaticdisplaysofthe auro-rae. He and hiscolleagueshave since re-ﬁned the idea. In a papertheypresented tothe European PlanetaryScience Congress,in Riga, Latvia on September19th, theypro-posed thatspacecraftequipped with theirnewpropulsion system could make around trip to the asteroid beltin little morethan three years. Aﬂeetof50 such craft,weighingabout5kgeach and thuscapableofbeinglaunched bya single rocket, couldvisit300 asteroids, surveythem and returnto Earth fora thrifty€60m ($72m) orso, in-cludingthe costoflaunch. The electricsolarwind sail (E-sail), asDrJanhunen dubshisinvention, consistsoffourwires, each 20km longbutjust25microns(millionthsofa metre) thick.These are braided togetherinto a tether.Forlaunch, thistetheriswound tightlyaround a small motorised reel inside thecraft. Once in space, the wiresare un-wound bythe motor, assisted bythe cen-tripetal force ofthe spinningcraft. Oncefullydeployed, the tetherthussweeps outacircle with a diameterof40km.The craft’spropulsion comesfrom theinteraction between thistetherand the hy-drogen and helium nuclei thatform mostofthe massofthe solarwind. These nucleiare positivelycharged. And so isthe tether,because the craftalso carriesa solar-pow-ered electron gun thatshootsoutintospace a stream ofelectronsscavenged fromthe wires. Since electronsare negativelycharged, ejectingthem in thiswaykeepsthe tetherpositive. Since like charges repel,the positive tetherreﬂectsthe positive hy-drogen and helium nuclei backwhere theycame from. And since to everyaction thereisan equal and opposite reaction (New-ton’sthird lawofmotion), thatreﬂectiondrivesthe spacecraftforward.Ifthe tetherwere stationarywith re-spectto the craft, the resultwould be a lop-sided force. Butbecause itrotates, that forceevensoutafteran entire circuit, propellingthe craftahead. Varyingthe outputof theelectron gun, however, can create a lopsid-ed force deliberately, permittingthe crafttobe steered. And, though the accelerationproduced issmall (1mm persecond persec-ond), there islittle in the vacuum of spaceto slowthe craftdown. Itcan thereforereach a speed oftensofkilometresper sec-ond aftera yearoftravel, makingits rapidjauntto the asteroid beltpossible. In addition to the E-sail, the craftDr Jan-hunen envisageswould have a small tele-scope on board, and also an infra-red spec-trometer. These would analyse the surfaceofeveryasteroid encountered. Each probewould be able to ﬂyto within 1,000km orso ofsixorseven asteroids, snapping pho-tosand collectingdata. Probeswould nothave the powerto broadcastthese data allthe waybackto Earth from the asteroidbelt. Buttheywould, instead, be able tostore them in ﬂash-memorychips, for relayto Earth on theirreturn home.In some waysan E-sail resemblesa so-larsail, a rival idea forpoweringcraftcheaplythrough space. Asolarsail pro-videspropulsion because the sunlight itre-ﬂectsexertspressure on the sail, pushing itforward. ButE-sailshave an importantad-vantage oversolarsails. Once unfurled,there isno easywayto stop a craftwith asolarsail gatheringspeed. An E-sail-pow-ered craftcan be prevented from accelerat-ingsimplybyswitchingoﬀitselectron gun.Thismeansitcan return to Earth under theinﬂuence ofthe sun’sgravity.E-sailshave, however, notbeen tested.Asolarsail has. Ikaros, a craftlaunched in2010 byJAXA, Japan’sspace agency, suc-cessfullydeployed such a sail with an areaof196 square metres. DrJanhunen hopes tomake a starton provinghistechnology byunwindinga tether100 metreslonginspace laterthisyear.Forthose ofa romanticdisposition, E-sailsmaycome to be seen asthe technol-ogythatwill unlockthe asteroid belt forcommercial exploitation. There isreasonto believe thatsome asteroidsare rich invaluable metals, such asplatinum and irid-ium. Craftequipped with manytetherscould carryheavypayloads—perhapsupto a tonne—thatwould permitminingequipmentto be deployed and cargoesofmetal to be broughtbackto Earth.One day, perhaps. But, in the meantime,E-sailsdo sound a plausible wayofextend-inghumanity’sunderstandingofthe near-bycosmicneighbourhood.7Exploring the asteroid beltE-sail awayAnewmethod ofpropelling spacecraftThe EconomistSeptember23rd2017 Scienceandtechnology69Academic sexismPurblind prejudiceSEXISM isamongthe prime suspects forthe scarcityoffemale professors.

Thispaper’sauthors, Friederike Men-gel ofthe UniversityofEssex, in Britain,Jan Sauermann ofStockholm University,in Sweden, and UlfZölitzofthe Instituteon Behaviourand Inequality, in Bonn,Germany, used data from nearly20,000studentevaluationsofinstructors.

The studentson each course hadbeen assigned, randomly, eithera male orafemale instructor, and ﬁlled out end-of-course evaluationsbefore theyknewtheirgrades. Halfofthe studentsin-volved were German, a third were Dutchand the restmostlyfrom otherEuropeanand some Asian countries. The resultsare both strikinganddisturbing. Ranked on a scale from zero to100, the evaluationsplace female in-structorsan average of37 slotsbelowmale ones.

Andwhen the researchersstripped outtheestimated genderbiasfrom the evalua-tion scores, the diﬀerence in rankingbetween male and female instructorsshrankfrom 37 rungsto ﬁve on the zero-to-100 ladder. Thatdiﬀerence isstatistical-lyinsigniﬁcant.Both male and female studentsgaveworse ratingsto female instructors,though the men were much more preju-diced.

Neitherthe signatories ofthepactnorthe League ofNationswaswillingorable to stem the rise ofmilitarism duringthe decade thatfollowed and itsapotheo-sisin the second world war.The ideasunderpinningthe pactdid,however, have a profound inﬂuence on thewayin which the alliessawboth their ﬁghtagainstthe Axispowersand the organisa-tion ofthe peace thatfollowed. When thewarended, with the partial exception ofthe SovietUnion, the victorshanded backthe land theyhad conquered. The Nurem-bergtrialsre-established the principle thatwagingaggressive warwasa criminal actand punished atleastsome ofHitler’shenchmen accordingly. The foundingofthe UNand the establishmentofthe Inter-national CourtofJustice in The Hague, al-though farfrom perfect, have had very pos-itive eﬀects. Gunboatdiplomacyimposed thisforum unmatched military, political,economic, cultural and moral strength.Ratherthan denythiselemental nature ofinternational aﬀairs, we embrace it.”Apartfrom the bitaboutcultural andmoral strength, neitherVladimirPutin norXi Jinping, who both challenge the liberalinternational orderbyseekingto createspheresofinﬂuence through intimidationand militarybullying, would ﬁnd any-thingto disagree with in thatstatement. MrPutin annexed Crimea in 2014 (the ﬁrsttime thatthe bordersofpost-warEuropehad been changed byforce) and launchedacovertinvasion ofeastern Ukraine insupportofa separatistinsurrection.

So too did inter-state warbetween them.Ofcourse there are still plentyof wars.In some waysthe NewWorld Order, whichhashelped make international warssomuch lessimaginable, hasinadvertentlymade possible more “intranational” wars.Fragile and fractiouscountriesthatwouldpreviouslyhave feared beingconqueredbymore powerful neighbourscan nowfallpreyto civil warsorbrutal insurgencieswithoutbad actorsfearinglossofthe na-tional territorytheyseekto control. Non-state groups, such asIslamicState (a misno-mer), can take and hold, atleastfor a while,territoryfrom dysfunctional governments.Well-meaningbutill-conceived warstochange odiousregimeshave sometimesgone badlywrong. Foreign-policyrealistswill also, with justiﬁcation, pointout thatthe main reason whygreatpowersno lon-gerﬁghteach otherisbecause the destruc-tive force ofnuclearweaponshasremovedanyincentive to do so.Yetthe authorsargue persuasively thatthe liberal orderofthe past70 yearshasbeen betterthan anyofthe alternativesand iswell worth strivingto preserve. Theauthorspaypropertribute to those whodeﬁned and foughtforthe principles thatbroughtitinto being. Theyinclude SalmonLevinson, a Chicago lawyerwhose ideasled directlyto the Kellogg-Briand pact;SumnerWelles, an American diplomatwho envisaged the creation ofa world organisation with the militaryclouttobringfuture warmongersto book; HerschLauterpacht, a greatPolish-British juristwho helped create a bodyofinternationallawbased on universal valuesand humandecency; and JamesShotwell, a Canadianacademicwho worked with Aristide Bri-and to bringthe pactinto beingand latercontributed to the design ofthe UN.ALAWin Maine excluded from over-time pay“the canning, processing,preserving, freezing, drying, marketing,storing, packingforshipmentordistribu-tion of” certain products. Butisthe end ofthatlist—“packingforshipmentordistri-bution”—one activity? Orare theydistinctthings, (1) packingforshipmentand (2)distribution? The companyargued thattheywere distinct, and thatalthough lor-rydriversdo notpack, theydo distribute,and are hence exemptfrom overtime pay.Alotofmoneywasatstake. Butthe com-panylostand the driversgotanotherchance to sue formillionsin backpay.Itwasnotjustthe lorrydrivers claim-ingvictory. Fansofthe serial (or “Oxford”)comma exulted. Had “distribution” beensetoﬀbyan extra comma, there wouldhave been no ambiguityatall, and no dis-pute. The serial comma appearsbeforethe lastitem in a list: “red, white, andblue” hasit; “red, white and blue” doesnot. Some style guidesrequire it; others(includingThe Economist’s) do not.Children are taughtthatgettingpunc-tuation wrongrisksmessingup the mes-sage theyare tryingto getacross, and theMaine case seemed to prove it. Buthowcan itbe thatthere isdisagreement onsuch a majorbitofpunctuation? Thosewho like hard rulesmustacceptthat thecomma isan oddball amongthe punctua-tion marks, in two ways. First, itdoes a lotofdiﬀerentjobs. One usage booklists 11functions, and itistypicallythe longestsection in a description ofpunctuation.Second, itisfrequentlyoptional.People do notlike the idea ofoptionalpunctuation. Much otherpunctuation ismandatory, includingthatstatements endin full stops, and questionsin question-marks. The comma, however, wasnotoriginallyintended asa grammaticalmark, buta place to pause forbreath. So the comma in thissentence isnotgrammatical, butstylistic. Some writerswould omitit, and theywould nothavebroken anyrules. Othersmightinsist thatitsimplyhasto be there. One readermightlookata passage and ﬁnd itwoefully shortofcommas; anothermightﬁnd itover-stuﬀed with them.In general, British writersseem to omitoptional commasmore often than Ameri-can writersdo. Lynne Murphy, an Ameri-can linguistatSussexUniversity, recentlylooked atlarge collectionsofBritish andAmerican textforsentencesbeginning “In19**”, foranyyear, asin “In 1914”. In theAmerican texts, the yearwasfollowed byacomma abouttwice asoften asnot. In Brit-ain those proportionswere reversed. Andwhereasitisharderto research, itseemsthatAmericans(though perhapsnotinMaine) are biggerfansofthe serial comma.MsMurphyalso found thatBritishfriendswished her“HappyBirthdayLynne” on social media; Americanspreferred “HappyBirthday, Lynne”. Andofcourse British and American rules dif-feron where commasare placed relativeto otherpunctuation marks, like invertedcommas. No wondernovice writersare often ataloss, and putcommaswhere theydo notbelong. The title ofthe punctuation-promotingbestseller“Eats, ShootsandLeaves” comesfrom a joke abouta poorlypunctuated wildlife guide describing thedietofpanda bears. Butputtinga commabetween a verb and itsdirectobject isnotacommon mistake. Amuch more fre-quentfoible in the writingofinexperi-enced students, isthe habitofputting acomma between a longsubjectand apredicate (ashere). Othersjoin two sen-tenceswith onlya comma, which makeseditorsfurious. With all thispotential confusion, itisno wonderthatstyle-bookauthorspreferto leave little wiggle-room, requiring orbanningwhereverpossible. Serial-comma fanssaythatitcan neverintro-duce ambiguity, and can often remove it.Theylike to cite an article in the Timesthatdescribed “encounterswith Nelson Man-dela, an 800-year-old demigod and a dildo collector.” ButasStan Carey, a language bloggerand editor, points out,addinga serial comma here would stillleave the possibilitythatMandela was ademigod, ifnota dildo aﬁcionado.Asmuch aspeople wantthe rulesforcommasto be ironclad, no mechanisticrulescan substitute forslowproofreadingand redrafting, oreven better, a good edi-tor. And havingsome ﬂexibilityin punc-tuation isone ofthe thingsthatgives anauthora style. Finally, writersmay bemild-mannered, buteveryone likesto getﬁghtingmad once in a while. Sometimeslittle thingsare biggerthan theyseem.Comma chameleonJohnsonThe punctuation markmostlikelyto startﬁghts between grammargurus72BooksandartsThe EconomistSeptember23rd201712MsHathawayand MrShapiro are rightto sound the alarm thatthe post-second-world-warconsensuson the illegality ofwarisundersiege.

Notonlyisthe bookwritten in alightand informative style, itiscleverlyconstructed. Each chapterhasa theme—tobacco, cotton, steam, oil, bootlegging, mobile telephonesand so on—and thesethemesare organised to lead the readerthrough a chronological historyoftheAmerican economy.Alongthe way, there isplentyof sur-prisingdetail. Until the ﬁrstworld war, forexample, the Busch family(who producedBudweiserbeer) held a bigannual celebra-tion forthe Kaiser’sbirthday. Bill Levitt, thebuilderwho pioneered the post-1945 shiftto suburban living, wasone ofmanywhorefused to sell homesto African-Ameri-cans. To ﬁnance theirnewcompany, AppleComputer, Steve Jobsand Steve Wozniakrespectivelysold a VWminibusand aHewlett-Packard calculator. ButMrSrinivasan, himselfan immi-grantwho became an entrepreneur, neverletsthe detail interfere with the bigger pic-ture. Ashe notes, European settlement inAmerica wasoriginallydriven bycommer-cial imperative. In 1606 the British char-tered the Virginia CompanyofLondon as aproﬁt-seekingoperation; an earlyversionof“venture capital”. The pilgrimson theMayﬂower(pictured) were backed byEng-lish ﬁnanciers. Commerce played a decisive partin settingthe course ofAmerican history. Theﬁrstsettlersstruggled buteventually a lucrative businesswasfound; growing andexportingtobacco in the southern states.Butthe earlyplantersdeveloped a taste forluxuries, placingthem in debtto Englishcreditors. Thatproved to be one source ofresentmenttowardsthe colonial power;anotherirritation wasBritish eﬀorts toearn some revenue afterthe expense of theSeven Years’ War(1756-63), which endedFrench attemptsto control the continent.The result, inevitablyperhaps, wastheAmerican warofindependence. The plantation economydeveloped inthe southern states, and the initial politicaldominance ofVirginia (which providedfourofAmerica’sﬁrstﬁve presidents) en-sured the continued survival ofslavery inthe newlyindependentcountry. By1860auction pricessuggested thatthe collectivevalue ofAmerican slaveswas$4bn atatime when the federal government’sannu-al budgetwasaround $69m. Thatexplainsboth whysouthern slaveowners, manyofwhom had borrowed againsttheirslavesascollateral, would nevergive up the prac-tice, and whya ﬁnancial settlementof theissue wasoutofthe question. The resultingcivil warhastened the industrialisation ofthe northern states,which owed theirvictory, in part, to theirgreatereconomicstrength. In the late 19thcenturyAmerican companieswere able toexploitthe economiesofscale thatcamefrom tradingovera continent-wide coun-try. Thisallowed them to overtake theirBritish and German rivals.In time, the growth ofthese industrialgiants, ortrustsastheywere known, led toanotherpolitical spat, asa Republicanpresident, Theodore Roosevelt, tried tochallenge monopolypower. Itwasunderthe ﬁrstRooseveltthatAmerica pulled de-cisivelyawayfrom a laissez-faire ap-proach, settingup the Pure Food and DrugActand the Federal MeatInspection Act toprotectconsumers. Amuch biggershift oc-curred underhisrelative, Franklin Roose-velt, who pursued aggressive policyinter-vention and established a welfare systemin the course ofthe GreatDepression.AsMrSrinivasan observes, Americancapitalism hasalwayshad a stronginputfrom the state: the tariﬀsthatshielded in-dustryin the 19th century; the militaryexpenditure thathelped develop radio, sat-ellitesand the internet; farm subsidies; thefederal guaranteesforbankdepositsandhome loans; and so on. “Itwasan endless-lycalibrated balance between state subsi-dies, social programmes, governmentcon-tracts, regulation, free will, entrepreneur-ship and free markets,” he writes. In short,American economichistoryismore com-plexthan some ideologuesseekto portrayit; thisexcellentbookgivesreaders a fullyrounded picture.7American economic historyAdance to themarkets oftimeAmericana: A 400-Year History ofAmerican Capitalism.

Since their previous forecastsin June the OECD’s economists have raisedexpected growth rates for both years formost countries. In the euro area, fore-casts for 2017 have increased by 0.3percentage points. Economic expansionexceeded expectations in the ﬁrst half ofthis year; consumption and exports havebeen robust, and growth is more evenlyspread across the zone’s member coun-tries. In India, the eﬀects of demonetisa-tion and the new goods-and-services taxhave caused this year’s growth forecast tobe trimmed by 0.6 points, to 6.7%.

Itsounded like a crossbe-tween Devon and Belfast, butitrevealedthe coloursand made the wordswittier.American, he thought, mightbe justthe ac-centforit. Butin hisdecadesasthe domi-nantﬁgure in British theatre, hismost fam-ousAmerican hire wasa disaster: thevenerable CharlesLaughton, asLear,stressingeveryword thatwascapitalisedin the FirstFolio, to ludicrouseﬀect.Authenticityin Shakespeare wasnotone ofhiscauses. Too much had changed,and would change. In 200 yearsthe playswould probablyneed translating. And theatre itselfwasso ephemeral, like anylivingthing. Agroup ofpeople combinedfora spell to puton performancesthatwere neverthe same twice, a bubble thathad to burstassoon astheyleftthe stage. The job ofa directorwastherefore high-lyrisky. Though he alwaysknewwhathewanted to do—asﬁrmlyashe knew, afterseeing“Love’sLaboursLost” at16, thathehad to be the man who made the magiconthatstage—he wasstill scared to death thathe mightnotpull itoﬀ. Those who saw theblood-soaked violence of“The WarsoftheRoses” in 1963, hisdaringmasked “Ores-teia” of1981, orthe braveryofhisEnglish-language premiere of“WaitingforGodot”in 1955, at25, imagined him brimmingwithconﬁdence, even arrogance. Yetbehind theloud aﬀability, the ﬂightson Concorde, theJaguarsand RollsRoycesand the glamor-ouswives, wasa stationmaster’sson fromSuﬀolk. Despite precocioussuccessfromCambridge onwards, he neverfeltcomfort-able atthe pinnacle ofBritish theatre—especiallynotatthe National, a dizzyingpublicrole where, like Nelson on his col-umn, pigeonsgothim from everyside. In thismaelstrom, he clungto his corebeliefs. Iffashion failed to followhim, hedidn’tcare. Shakespeare’siambicpentameterswere sacred, precise asa page ofmusic, neverto be broken mid-line, even atafull stop. The rhythm ofaction and inac-tion in Samuel Beckett’splays, and thepausesand silencesin Harold Pinter’s(12ofwhose workshe premiered, from “TheHomecoming” onwards) had to be rigor-ouslyobserved. Hisreverence fortext in-duced Tennessee Williams, amongothers,to send him theirplaysunasked. Next, he needed settled players. Ratherthan assemblinga castfrom scratch foreach production, he insisted when hefounded the Royal Shakespeare Companyin 1960 thatthe 30-40 actorsshould be onthree-yearcontracts. Theywould work to-getheroverthe longterm like a tribe, learn-ingfrom each otherasmuch asfrom him.(Autocracywasnothisstyle. Hisstyle was“Let’sﬁnd out.”) He tried to do the same atthe National when he tookoverin 1973;timeswere more troubled then. Butwheneveryone in a companywasinspired to-gether, he feltecstatic. The RSC in themid-1960s—personiﬁed byDavid Warner’sganglingdreamy-studentHamlet, and underpinned bysubsidy—was“hot” in awayBritish theatre hasneverbeen since. Politics vartSuch a companyneeded a permanenthome. Adecentbuildingconferred identi-tyand drewin money. Withoutthem, theBritish publicseemed notto notice theatre.To the RSC’snatural home in Stratford headded London basesatthe Aldwych and,later, the Barbican, and also oversaw theNational’smove from the cramped Old Victo a sprawlingnewconcrete venue on theSouth Bank. Hisswitch from the RSCto theNational wasrocky; he wasseen asa trai-torbyone, asan interloperbythe other.And he wasnowplunged deep into politi-cal rowsoverwhetherthe National’srep-ertoire wastoo left-wingortoo elitist, overcensorship and, continually, overpublicfunding. He found himselfhotlydefend-ingnotonlythe costofthe newbuildings,butalso theatre itself—and whether, in a re-cession, itshould be subsidised atall. No question, he shotback. Theatre wassociety’ssharpestwayto observe itselfand provoke authority. Itwasawkward. Itwasdangerous. So itwasoften notcom-mercial, and needed help. Sometimes, too,itssheerbeautymade itnecessaryto a civi-lised society. Thiswasthe spiritin which,from 1984 to 1990, he wasartisticdirector ofGlyndebourne Festival Opera—pumpingtoo much adrenalin, asusual, in an evenmore elitistenterprise than spoken theatre.He homed in on Mozart, whom he hadloved a little earlierthan Shakespeare,bangingouthissonatason the piano at theage ofnine. Though he had greatsuccesswith othercomposers(a ravishingproduc-tion ofBritten’s“AMidsummerNight’sDream”, a startlinglysexyrendition ofStrauss’s“Salome”), he wasthere for“Così” and “Figaro”, asmanytimesasany-one wanted. He stayed close for35 years.Recountinghislife, he tended to men-tion Mozartand Shakespeare in the samebreath. Formanyprivileged years, he livedinside theirheads. The frustrationsofWhitehall and Westminster, the backstagebitching, onslaughtsbythe critics, his mis-erable divorces, all occurred against thatbackground ofgenius: a sublime regularityofform in wordsormusicwhich, evenwhen crisscrossed byanguished irregular-ities, still held each workin shape.
