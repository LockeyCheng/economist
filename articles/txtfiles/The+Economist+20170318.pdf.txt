Nowthingsare diﬀerent. Thisweekthe Fed raised rates forthe second time in three months—thankspartlyto the vigourofthe American economy, butalso because ofgrowth every-where else.

Itisalso atest. MrModi could use hisgrowingpowerto reignite India’sculture wars, assome ofhissupporterswish. Instead, he oughtto use itto unshackle India’seconomy.Lucknowand fora long time to comeUntil the 1970sIndia wasvirtuallya one-partystate, with Con-gress, the partyofindependence, rulingoverpolitics—includ-ingin UttarPradesh. Todaythe countryseemsto be headingthatwayagain, butthistime with the BJPin the ascendant.Congresscame outon top thisweekin electionsin Punjab, amiddlingstate. In placessuch asWestBengal and Tamil Nadu,local partiesrule the roost. And the BJP’sadversariescan stillwin byteamingup. Butin a countryofunfathomable diversity,the BJPisasclose to pre-eminence asanypartyislikely to get.In UttarPradesh the BJP’svictorywasall the more remark-able forthe turmoil MrModi unleashed late lastyear byvoid-ingmostofIndia’sbanknotes. “Demonetisation” wasmeantto hurtcrooksand bringthe “black” economyonto the books.Instead itcaused chaosforordinaryIndians. Yetsomehow, theBJPturned the strawofdemonetisation into electoral gold.The charisma and drive ofMrModi ispartofthe explana-tion. The son ofa chai-wallah, he embodiesthe aspirations ofIndia’sstrivers. Butthe energyand organisation ofhis partycount, too. The BJP’sappetite forpowerismatched onlyby theopposition’sdeﬁciencies. In thisweek’selectionsCongresswon mostseatsin Goa and Manipur, two tinystates. But theBJP, quickerto woo allies, won the rightto form governments.In some waysthisdominance isalarming. Although MrModi himselfiscareful aboutwhathe says, hisparty harboursmanychauvinisticHindus, who viewIndia’s180m-odd Mus-limswith suspicion and disdain. Itdid notﬁeld a single Mus-lim candidate in UttarPradesh, where 19% ofthe population isMuslim. Italso tookadvantage ofthe electionsto pass legisla-tion thathad been blocked bythe upperhouse ofthe nationalparliamenton the ground thatitwasunfairto Muslims (seepage 24). MrModi hasdone nothingto stiﬂe a growing cultureofintolerance in India, notjusttowardsMuslims, but towardsall criticsofthe pricklynationalism thatthe BJPespouses.Yethe hasalso pressed ahead with economicreforms. Hehaswon parliamentaryapproval fora nationwide sales taxtoreplace a confusingarrayoflocal ones. The government isim-provingthe administration ofIndia’sbewilderingbunch ofwelfare schemesforthe poor.

The Dutch themselves, excited by theunaccustomed attention, seem to have taken the idea to heart.The performance ofGeertWildersand hisfar-rightFreedomParty(PVV), itwassaid, would be a portentofMarine Le Pen’schancesin France’spresidential election and ofthe prospectsforpopulism rightacrossEurope.On the night, MrWilderscame a poorsecond, winning just13% ofthe vote and 20 seats—farbehind the Liberals, led by theprime minister, MarkRutte, who won 21% ofthe vote and 33seats(see page 51). Understandably, MrRutte wasjubilant, pro-claimingthathiscountryhad “said ‘whoa’ to the bad sortofpopulism”. Jesse Klaverofthe GreenLeftparty, which had itsbestresultever, eclipsingLabour(see Charlemagne), with 9%ofthe vote, said thatthe Dutch message to the restof Europewasthat“populism did notbreakthrough.”MrWilders’sbad showingiswelcome.

Unfortunately, however, itis too soon Dutch electionsDomino theoryGeertWilders’s poorshowing does notnecessarilymean Marine Le Pen will loseThe Economist March 18th 2017 

2 to celebrate the roll-back of populism.
The very idea of a populist “domino theory” is misleading.
The term derives from the war in Vietnam, where it was used
to justify American intervention to stop the spread of commu-
nism. In a military context it made sense. North Vietnam’s con-
quest of Saigon let it move on to Cambodia. But in democratic
elections, nothing similar happens. When Britain voted to
leave the European Union, the UK Independence Party did not
suddenly take control of the economy and establish coastal
bases from which to launch raids on Scheveningen.
Even if Mr Wilders had prevailed this week, he would not
have won power—in the Netherlands governments are
formed from coalitions, and virtually all the other parties had
vowed not to work with him. The boost his triumph would
have given Ms Le Pen, who the polls suggest is unlikely to be-
come president, would have been insigniﬁcant next to the ebb
and ﬂow of the campaign within France. So, too, his defeat is a
setback but hardly decisive.
Political movements sometimes leap in inspirational
waves from one country to another, but local circumstances
make all the diﬀerence. Mr Trump’s win could not have hap-
pened without the peculiarities of America’s electoral college.
By the same token, the fact that Mr Wilders did not win does
not translate on to Ms Le Pen. The Dutch political system is
open and diﬀuse, with over a dozen parties in parliament and
low barriers for new ones to make it in. The French system is
more rigid. Because it has shut Ms Le Pen’s National Front (FN)

out of nearly all levels of government for years, despite rising
popular support, the prospect of a sudden breakthrough is
greater. France’s presidential run-oﬀ will pit two candidates
head to head. One of them will almost certainly be Ms Le Pen.
Another reason to think that this may not be the high-water
mark for populism is that Mr Wilders has shown how to drag
politics in your own direction even without winning power.
Mr Rutte has held him oﬀ in part by adopting some of his lan-
guage. In the Netherlands, traditionally a tolerant country, it is
now common to speak of Islam as a threat; the discussion of
asylum-seekers focuses entirely on how to keep them out, and
the idea of leaving the EU is now taken seriously. Mr Wilders
has also put forward legitimate arguments about the welfare
of working-class Dutch left behind by globalisation. If a new
government dominated by the centre-right Liberals and the
liberal D66 party ignores these issues, it will ﬁnd its triumph
over populism short-lived.

Here’s to Ponypark Slagharen
All of these anxieties, over Islam, refugees, the EU and global-
isation, are as pressing for European voters today as they were
yesterday. As it turned out, they did not lead to a win for Mr
Wilders in the Netherlands, but they might yet for Ms Le Pen in

The Scottish independence referendum of 2014 was billed
by nationalists as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. But
they are right to demand another. Ms Sturgeon’s Scottish Na-
tional Party (SNP) won an election last year on the promise of a
new referendum in the event of a “material change” in circum-
stances. Brexit is as material as it gets. Mrs May and Britain’s
Parliament, the consent of which is needed for another plebis-
cite, must not deny the Scottish people a second vote.

Scots should read Brexit as an argument for remaining in Britain, not leaving it
THIS was meant to be the
week when a proud, sover-
eign nation served notice that it
wanted to leave the overbear-
ing, unrepresentative union to
which it had long been shack-
led. And so it was—but not in
quite the way that Theresa May
had imagined. Britain’s prime minister had planned to trigger
Article 50 of the European Union treaty, beginning the two-
year process of Britain’s exit from the EU. But she was forced to
delay her plans when Scotland’s ﬁrst minister, Nicola Stur-
geon, upstaged her by announcing that she would seek a new
referendum on Scottish independence.
The threat of a second constitutional earthquake in as
many years is the latest reminder of Brexit’s unintended conse-
quences (see page 57). The English-led move to leave a 40-year-
old union with Europe is pulling at the seams of its 300-year-
old union with Scotland. Mrs May’s fundamentalist interpre-
tation of the Brexit referendum—that it requires departure from
the EU’s single market and an end to free movement to and
from the continent—ignores the concerns of Scots, who voted
to remain, and creates an intractable problem for Northern Ire-
land, which shares a land border with the EU. But the lesson
for Scots from Brexit is more complex than Ms Sturgeon sug-
gests. The arguments she puts forward for remaining in the EU
highlight the weaknesses in their case for independence.

If at ﬁrst you don’t secede...
But Mrs May has the power to delay it—and on March 16th she
said that there should be no referendum before Britain’s rela-
tions with the EU are clear. Ms Sturgeon wants the vote to take
place at some point between autumn 2018 and spring 2019,
when Brexit negotiations will be entering their ﬁnal, fraught
phase. She suggested this week that this would allow an inde-
pendent Scotland speedily to rejoin the EU. That is mistaken.
There is no prospect of Scotland completing “Scoxit” before
Britain leaves the EU (at the time of the referendum in 2014, an
exit period for Scotland of 18 months was pencilled in). Euro-
pean oﬃcials have made clear that there would be no “fast
track” entry process for a country that was previously part of a
member state.
What holding a referendum during Brexit negotiations
would achieve, as Ms Sturgeon surely knows, is maximum
pressure on the British government, which would be incapa-
ble of ﬁghting on a second front in Scotland. And it would

1

2 damage Scotland’s own interests: ﬁrst by muddying the Brexit
talks, in which Scotland has a stake, whether it ends up as part
of Britain or not; and second by forcing Scots to vote before it is
clear what sort of deal Britain is going to get with the EU.
Whenever the second referendum campaign begins, Brexit
will make life trickier for the unionist side. Already Mrs May is
ﬁnding that her position on the European Union makes it hard-
er to defend the British union. Ms Sturgeon says she wants
Scots “to be in control of events and not just at the mercy of
them”. How can British ministers disagree, when so many of
them urged Britons to “vote Leave, take control” last summer?
Yet Brexit creates problems for the nationalists, too. Just as it
sounds unconvincing for Brexiteers now to argue for the un-
ion, it is diﬃcult for Ms Sturgeon to beat the drum both for
membership of the EU and for exit from Britain. As she has
pointed out, it is a bad idea to leave the single market to which

you send the lion’s share of your exports. For Scotland, that
means Britain. She laments the hardening of Britain’s borders
with Europe. Yet an independent Scotland might well mean a
harder border with England, particularly if Scotland rejoined
the EU. Pro-Europeans have noted that the sovereignty you re-
gain by leaving a union is illusory when it also means losing
the clout you get as a member of a more powerful group. So it
would be if Scotland left Britain: it would indeed be more
sovereign in a pure sense, but at the cost of its seat on the UN
Security Council, nuclear weapons, G7 membership and
much else that aids true self-determination in the world.
The Scots are in a wretched position. But they should be in
no doubt: exit from Britain would compound the mistake Brit-
ain is making by leaving the EU. Though Brexit is the main mo-
tive for Ms Sturgeon’s renewed independence push, it is also a
warning of the perils of going it alone. 7

Aid to fragile states

Finance to fragile states

Providing foreign aid to chaotic countries is both necessary and hazardous. It can be done better
DAVID CAMERON lost his
job as prime minister be-
cause he could not reconcile
Britons to Europe. He might
have sulked on the backbench-
es. Instead, Mr Cameron has a
new (unpaid) job as the chair-
man of a commission on fragile
states. Having failed to persuade Britons to stick with countries
where they like to holiday, whose wine they happily imbibe
and where many own homes, he will now try to convince
them to send more money to some of the world’s poorest,
most corrupt and most violent places. 
If Mr Cameron has lost his mind, he is not the only one. Brit-
ain’s Department for International Development (DfID) plans
to spend half its budget on fragile states and regions. It is nag-
ging others to do the same, with some success. The World Bank
plans to double to $14bn the money it allocates to fragile states
over the next three years. The war-scorched Central African
Republic (CAR) will get as much as a third of its GDP in assis-
tance from the World Bank over the next three years (see page
39). This raises two questions. Is sending more money to rick-
ety countries wise? And is it being done well?

tial candidate in 1964) you ought to hunt where the ducks are,
more aid should ﬂow to the worst places. Moreover, fragile
states are a regional menace. The calamity that is the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo is a threat to its neighbours, many of
which are themselves fragile. If basket-cases can be stabilised,
many will beneﬁt.
It will not be easy. Corruption and mismanagement are rife.
In many of these countries Big Men are above the law, politics
is a form of licensed theft and the police are little more than
bandits. Money spent on rebuilding bridges or oﬃces may be
wasted if ﬁghting resumes and the new infrastructure is blown
up. Donors can undermine fragile states by setting up parallel
welfare systems and by pinching their best bureaucrats. Rich
countries often hold back until things get really bad, then rush
in with bags of food—as Britain is now doing in South Sudan
and Somalia. 
Deft aid schemes need to avoid these pitfalls. Food aid
looks good on television, but it is immensely wasteful. It costs a
lot of money to get food to warring regions, and the recipients
frequently sell it to raise money for whatever they really need.
Far better just to give people cash. 
Another good idea is to pay for a hefty peacekeeping force,
which can provide the security needed for all else to develop.
(The CAR has 13,000 blue helmets.) Young men can be hired to
build roads. This would not only connect farmers with urban
consumers, making both groups better oﬀ, but would also give
those young men a reason not to take up arms. Paul Collier, a
leading light in Mr Cameron’s commission, oﬀers two other
suggestions. Donors could provide risk insurance or subsidies
to help private ﬁrms enter terrifying markets. And they could
let the government set spending priorities but, given its ex-
treme lack of capacity, channel the spending through whatev-
er organisations work in any given village, from NGOs to
churches. An independent agency would be needed to over-
see how the money is spent. 
Fixing places like the CAR will be hard, and many of these
new ideas may yet fail. But with luck, donors will learn from
them. Given the stakes, there is no excuse for not trying. 7

More bread for basket cases
The answer to the ﬁrst question is a qualiﬁed yes. It is true that,
as development economists have argued for years, the ideal re-
cipients of foreign largesse are poor, well-governed countries.
Places like Bangladesh and Senegal still need help, and are not
so atrociously mismanaged that the aid is bound to be stolen
or wasted. These days, though, there are not many such coun-
tries. China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and others are all pull-
ing their people out of deep poverty, thank goodness. 
The most acute need is now in fragile states, where govern-
ment barely functions. Such places are home to half the
world’s very poor people, up from a third in 2010, on the
OECD’s rather broad deﬁnition of fragile. On the principle that

The ponderoustitle ofthe stealth legis-lation isthe EnemyProperty(Amendmentand Validation) Act. Itrevisesan alreadycontroversial law, passed in 1968, which al-lowed the Indian state to seize propertiesowned byits“enemies”, which wasto saypeople ofPakistani orChinese nationality.The newlawredeﬁnesthe word “enemy”,so thatthose designated asenemieswillremain so even ifIndia and the countryconcerned startgettingon famously. It alsodecreesthatall the heirsofthe original “en-emy” should also be considered enemies,in perpetuity, even iftheyhold Indian citi-zenship. Furthermore, anytransferof suchpropertyoutofgovernmentcustodianshipafterthe 1968 actwill be retroactively re-voked. And civil courtswill be barred fromhearinganydisputesoversuch propertyfrom nowon.Whatthe legal mumbo-jumbo meansisthatsome 2,100 propertiesseized in thewake ofwarswith Pakistan and China inthe 1960swill foreverremain the propertyofthe Indian government. There is, ofcourse, also a subtext: nearlyall the proper-tyconcerned belonged to wealthyMus-lims, and the need to “tighten” the lawre-ﬂectsthe factthatseveral ofthem or theirheirshave successfullyfoughtin Indiancourtsto reclaim it. In 2005 India’ssupreme courtorderedthe governmentto hand overmostofthepropertyofthe formerRajah ofMahmud-abad, once one ofthe wealthiestlandown-ersin UttarPradesh, to hissole heir, Mu-hammad AmirMuhammad Khan.

The displaced vendorscan atleastﬁnd companyin theirmisery: overthe past two yearsBangkok’smunicipal governmenthasevicted almost15,000hawkersfrom the city’spavements.

Othervendorshave losttheir space tolandlordscashingin on Bangkok’sboomingpropertymarket,particularlyin the area around ThongLo.Bangkok’sgovernmentisnotthe onlyone seekingto “tidyup”itsstreets.

Singapore faced thisproblem yearsago, and moved its hawk-ersoﬀthe streetsinto dedicated, convenient“hawkercentres”,with runningwaterand regularhygiene inspections.

Itsetsthe stage forChina topassitsﬁrstcivil code, an overarching lawgoverninglegal disputesotherthan thoseinvolvingcrimes.China hasa civil-lawsystem, whichmeansthatstatutesare essential referenceforjudges. (In common-lawcountriessuchasBritain and America, verdictsare alsodecided accordingto precedent: ie, previ-ousrulingsbycourts.) ButunderCommu-nistrule, China hasmuddled throughwithouta uniﬁed civil code. Ithasbits ofone. Itpassed an inheritance lawin 1985, acontractlawin 1999 and a propertylawin2007. Butthere are biggapsand inconsis-tencies. The Supreme People’sCourt, thehighestjudicial authority, issuesdirectivesin an attemptto sortthese out. The countryhasbeen tryingto write acivil code since 1954. ButChina’sthen ruler,Mao Zedong, waslukewarm aboutit—hedid notwantanylawthatmightrestrict hispower. China’scurrentleadersare farkeenerto have one. Theyhope itwill pro-vide a stable legal frameworkfora rapidlyevolvingsocietyracked byincreasinglycomplexdisputes. In 2014 theydecided totryagain, aimingto write one by2020. Thisweek’sapproval ofthe code’sgeneral prin-ciplesisthe ﬁrstfruit. Itcoverseverythingfrom individual rightsand the statute oflimitationsto whetherfetusescan ownproperty(theycan). The preamble updatesand expandsone thatwasadopted in 1986, when the le-gal system still looked much like the SovietUnion’s. In deﬁninga company, forexam-ple, the old principlestalked onlyaboutstate-owned orcollective enterprises, aswell asjointventureswith foreign ﬁrms.The newpreamble hasa more useful deﬁ-nition: “a legal entityestablished forthepurposesofmakingproﬁts”. The old ver-sion did notmention privacy. The new onesayscitizenshave a rightto it. The old prin-ciplessaid that“where there isno provi-sion oflaw, activitiesmustbe in accor-dance with state policy.” Strikingly, thatclause hasbeen deleted. Some ofthe newprincipleshave beensetoutbefore. Privacyrights, forexample,are in the tortbill of2009. Buttheirinclu-sion in the revised preamble givesthemmore authority.Notall the changesare forthe better. Inasection on protectingpersonal reputa-tions, the newpreamble makesitan of-fence to defame “heroesand martyrs”.Thatislikelyto have a chillingeﬀect on his-torical inquiry. Qiao Xiaoyang, the head ofthe NPC’slawcommittee, saysthe civilcode “upholdsprivate rights”. Butthe onesmentioned in the law, such asthe rights tolife, health, and reputation, do notcoverthe full range.Acivil code—embracinglawsofproper-ty, contract, inheritance, familyand mar-riage—will notguarantee fairness. TheCommunistPartywill continue to ignorethe lawwhen itwantsto.

Butforthosedetermined to shrinkthe government, thatmaynotbe enough. AmericansforPros-perity, an inﬂuential campaign group, callsitObamacare 2.0; FreedomWorks, an anti-taxgroup, Obamacare-lite. The RepublicanStudyCommittee, which consistsof170House Republicans, describesitas“a Re-publican welfare entitlement”. WhenObamacare became law, Democratscrowed thatitwould prove impossible totake health insurance awayfrom peopleonce theyhad it. Forthose on the drown-the-governmentwingofthe RepublicanParty, the ﬁghtoverrepealingthe law isanexistence-threateningevent. Ifa Republi-can presidentwith majoritiesin bothhousesofCongresscannotsucceed in tak-ingawayan entitlement, then theymightaswell give up.Viewed from the restofthe world, thisdebate hasan unreal quality. America isalone amongrich countriesin notarrang-ingforitsgovernmentto provide someform ofhealth care forall itspeople.

Itfollowsfrom thisthatthose whodo nothave insurance could getitif theyonlyworked a bitharder.Butitisalso a question ofhistory and,more speciﬁcally, ofhowwelfare states inthe restofthe world developed alongsidewarfare. European welfare statesbegan inPrussia atthe end ofthe 19th century, whenwarwith France required the mobilisationofa large numberofcivilians. Britain’swelfare state hasitsoriginsin the discov-erythatmanyofthe men who presentedthemselvesto recruitingoﬃcesduring theBoerwarwere nothealthyenough to ﬁght.Before the second world war, British liber-alswould have seen the creation ofa gov-ernment-run national health service as anunwarranted intrusion ofgovernmentintoprivate life. After1945 itseemed a justre-ward fora population thathad suﬀered.In America thisrelationship betweenwarfare and health care hasevolved diﬀer-ently. The momentwhen the highestpro-portion ofmen ofﬁghtingage were at war,duringthe civil war(when 13% ofthe pop-ulation wasmobilised), came too early tospurthe creation ofa national health sys-tem. Instead, the federal governmentbrokethe putative linkbetween warand univer-sal health care bytreatingex-servicemendiﬀerentlyfrom everyone else.

MrMattishasto tread a delicate pathbetween the bombastofMrTrump’scam-paign promise to “bomb the shit” outofISISand the operational constraintsim-posed byBarackObama, which manymil-itaryand intelligence oﬃcersthought un-dulyrestrictive. Amongthe changesthatare in the pipe-line (orare alreadybeingquietlyimple-mented) isa looseningofthe guidelines MrObama setfordrone strikesand targetedkillingsin placesthatare notcounted aswarzones, such asYemen, Somalia andLibya. Although MrObama authorised ex-tensive use ofdronesto kill terrorists, par-ticularlyal-Qaeda groupsin Pakistan’sNorth Waziristan, he became uncomfort-able aboutthe ease with which Americacould kill itsenemies, whereverthey were. MrObama’splaybookfordrone usehad fourmain principles. The ﬁrstwas thatstrikesoutside warzonescould occur onlyifthere wasnear-certaintythatcivilianswould notbe harmed. The second wasthatthe targethad been identiﬁed withnear-certaintyand represented a threatthatcould notbe dealtwith in anyotherway. The third wasproperoversightandchain-of-command accountability—a rea-son formovingresponsibilityfordronestrikesfrom the CIAto the Pentagon. Thefourth wasthatanystrikeshad to advancebroaderAmerican strategicinterests—forexample, theyshould notundermine intel-ligence-sharingwith a hostcountryor be arecruitingagentfornewterrorists. Sensible though these ruleswere, theyreduced the speed and nimblenessthat issometimesrequired when a targetisﬂeet-ing. Underthe looseningofthe rules nowunderway, avoidingcivilian deathswill nolongerbe an overridingpriority. Aplacethatfailsto qualifyasa warzone may bedesignated “an area ofactive hostilities”where rulesofengagementcan be eased.MrObama used thislabel to authorisestrikesagainstISin itsLibyan base, Sirte.MrTrump hasalreadyagreed to a Penta-gon requestto applythe description tothree provincesofYemen, which have sub-sequentlybeen heavilypounded. One at-tackon March 2nd againstthe Yemeni al-Qaeda aﬃliate comprised 25 strikesbymanned and unmanned aircraft(nearlyasmanyasin the whole oflastyear).Afurtherchange isthatthe CIAwillonce again be allowed to carryoutlethalstrikes, asopposed to usingitsdrones onlyto gatherintelligence.

In OctoberMrMacri’scentre-rightCambiemos(“Let’schange”)coalition facesa mid-term election foral-mosthalfofcongress. Thiswill be a sym-bolicreferendum on the government. In fact, itissurprisingthatMr Macri, aformerbusinessman, remainsaspopularashe is(hisapproval ratingisaround50%). Hisvictoryin November2015 wasunexpected. He inherited a countrywhose future wasmortgaged: interna-tional reserveswere negligible; a disputewith bondholdershad cutArgentina oﬀfrom creditmarkets; inﬂation wasaround30%; and the ﬁscal deﬁcitwas5.4% ofGDPin 2015, swollen byindiscriminate subsi-diesto consumersand cronycompaniesand ﬁnanced byprintingmoney. MrMacri’steam moved swiftlyto dis-mantle exchange controls, devalue thepeso and settle with the bondholders. Itraised interestratesto stop inﬂation fromgettingoutofcontrol, which pushed theeconomyinto a shortrecession. Ithas oth-erwise moved cautiously. Oﬃcial targetscall forsingle-digitinﬂation to be reachedonlyin 2019, when the deﬁcitshould be2.2% ofGDP. Some 15% ofimportsare stillsubjectto the Kirchners’ barriers.Thiscaution stemsfrom circum-stance—MrMacri lacksa majorityin con-gress—butalso from hispreference for con-sensus-building, honed duringeightyearsasmayorofBuenosAires.

Despite an in-crease in social assistance, a survey bytheCatholicUniversityfound thatthe urbanpovertyrate edged up lastyearfrom 29% to33%. Since Decemberopinion pollsshow asharp dip in optimism.Thatcoincideswith a seriesofwhatpunditscall “unforced errors” bythe gov-ernment.

Criticsalsocomplain ofmicromanagementbytheCasa Rosada, the presidential palace. MarcosPeña, MrMacri’scabinetchief,insiststhatthe errorsare minorcomparedwith those ofthe Kirchners.

One stop ontheiritinerarywasthe HogarSeguro (SafeHome) Virgen de la Asunción, a shelter forindigent children, which had been thesubjectof reports aboutsexual abuse, vio-lence and overcrowding. The team arrivedtoo late. Thatnight, a ﬁre engulfed a girls’dormitory, killingatleast40 adolescentsand severelyinjuringa dozen.AtragedyatHogarSeguro waspre-ordained.

Theycome fromviolenthomesorfrom familiesthatcannotaﬀord to take care ofthem. The Guatema-lan governmentspendsthe equivalentof3.2% ofGDPdirectlyon children and ado-lescents, includingon education. That isthe lowestrate in Central America. Thechild-protection agencyhasa budgetofjust$2.5m to payforstate-run facilities,which house around 1,000 children, andformonitoringscoresofprivatelyrunhomes. These hold the bulkofchildrenand varygreatlyin quality. Even the bestdo notprovide a healthyenvironmentforchildren to growup in, saychildren’s-rightsadvocates.

South Sudan’seconomyisamongthe leastdiversiﬁed in the world. In 2014 oilprovided 99.8% ofthe country’sexportrev-enues. Atindependence in 2011, when pro-duction washigh and oil fetched over $100abarrel, petrodollarsﬂowed freelyand fu-elled colossal political patronage. But ashutdown in 2012 followed bycivil war,which broke outin 2013, hasslashed out-put. South Sudan nowproducesaround120,000 barrelsofoil a month; halfasmuch asitdid atitspeak, and the price perbarrel isonlyhalfwhatitwasin 2011.

Indeed, facedwith a worse exchange rate, in 2015 farmersin Equatoria, an area ofrich soil south ofJuba, began sellingtheirproduce to Ugan-da—reversingthe normal trade ﬂow. Con-ﬂict, however, hasstopped this. In July, abarelyrespected ceaseﬁre broke down inJuba; since then the civil war, which hadpreviouslybeen conﬁned to the north, hasspread to Equatoria. The numberofSouthSudanese refugeesin Uganda hasmorethan tripled to above 700,000, while farm-inghasall butstopped. “There isreallynoproductive capacityleft,” saysMrAjak.Inﬂation hasslightlydecelerated in thepastfewmonths, takingSouth Sudan outoftechnical hyperinﬂation.

Known as the internet of things (IoT), this interconnected landscape could boost efficiency for businesses and consumers – as well as add significant data privacy and security risks.  “IoT is designed to connect millions of things ADVERTISEMENTIn order to protect IoT data, it is important to under-stand who ‘owns’ it. But the answer to this is often unclear and varies depending on local regulation. Overall, according to law firm Taylor Wessing, there is no property right in a piece of data itself. But when the data is processed, it becomes the property of whoever collects it in a database – not the user, explains Jamal Elmellas, CTO at Auriga Consulting, citing the example of location data on a smartphone, which could be collected by an app or the phone’s manufacturer: “Once the data is pro-cessed and therefore value has been added to it, it belongs to someone else.” IoT is only in its early stages and widespread adop-tion of its related applications, such as smart cars and connected healthcare, is still years away. But as the market develops, security must be built into devices from the start. At the same time, data must be protected by those responsible for its care, says Walter Lee, head of the innovation management office, global safety division at NEC. He thinks biometrics is key to the future of securing IoT: “It requires securing the data and securing the device.” Having a good inventory will be important as the number of IoT devices grows, adds John Edgar, co-founder and managing director at Stae. “Every organisation dealing with large amounts of data should employ a database architect or engineer to own the data.”“Once data is processed…it belongs to someone else.”AGILITY & SECURITYFinding a digital balanceDigital technology such as cloud and social media provide customers and employees the flexibility and convenience they want, but digital ways of working can also put valuable data at risk by opening up more vectors of attack. This has led firms to ap-ply robust security – which has resulted in another problem: Security solutions can lock a technology down, rendering it useless. Individual technologies offer different benefits and risks. The huge number of devices comprising the internet of things (IoT), provides efficiency for accessing data but also adds risks partly because security isn’t built into the ecosystem. Managing this requires protecting devices while ensuring they are still able to do the job for which they were intended INSURERS FIGHT BACK AGAINST  STATE-SPONSORED CYBERCRIME An increasing risk of cyber-attacks and resulting fall out has created a huge appetite for cyber insurance solutions.

Afterhe threatened sanctionsifhe were not al-lowed to come, hislandingrightswere re-voked. HundredsofTurkish-Dutch stagedaprotest, and the Turkish ministerof fam-ilyaﬀairsdrove to Rotterdam to speak tothem. Dutch police dispersed the crowdwith truncheons, dogsand water-can-nons, and forciblyreturned the minister toGermany. The reaction in Turkeywasfuri-ous. Turksdeclared boycotts, staged prot-estsand vowed sanctions.The clash, manyfeared, would playinto MrWilders’shands. Instead, ital-lowed MrRutte to showbackbone andwiden hislead. Nonetheless, itmayhavehelpedthe PVV to pull Dutch votersyet fur-therto the right. Already, accordingto Peil,apollster, 71% ofDutch wantto pull out ofthe EU’sassociation agreementwith Tur-key, which preventsthe governmentfromforcingDutch ofTurkish origin to take inte-gration courses. Butin the end, domesticissuesseem tohave trumped international ones. TheNetherlandstooklongerto recoverfromthe euro crisisthan some neighbours.

Some 13 partiesmade itinto parliament, up from 11in the previouselection. Aftertheirﬁnal pre-election de-bate, the partyleaderscould barelysqueeze in tightenough fora portrait. Butthe mid-sized partiesthatwill prob-ablybe needed to form a coalition are di-vided, on classicleft-rightlines, over howwealth should be shared.

Al-though around halfa million refugee chil-dren have been sentto school, nearly asmanyremain outofit. Child labouris notunheard-of, norare child brides.

The young, educated urbanitesofAmsterdam’sCanalDistrictorHaarlem barelygota look-in. And yetin an electionwith manysubplots, theirswasamongthe more arresting.Though MrWildersdisappointed on election day, he remainsmore than an irritant. With 20 seatsin the new150-seatparlia-ment, he maywell lead the opposition to whatevergovernmentemergesfrom the electoral mélange produced on March 15th. Hisviciousbrand ofanti-Islam populism isno lessshocking forits fa-miliarity(MrWildersfounded hisFreedom Partyin 2006, and heisnotthe ﬁrstpeddlerofxenophobia to Dutch voters). And oppo-sition presentsno impedimentto hisinﬂuence. Before the elec-tion MrWilderstold an interviewerthatbytuggingother partiesin hisdirection, he had alreadywon. In a way, he wasright.Buthisinﬂuence extendsin otherdirections. Until now, thepoliticsofidentityacrossEurope hasbeen largelyceded to thelikesofMrWilders. Mainstream partiesofleftand right oftenstruggle to ﬁnd the vocabularyto discussculture, nation, race andimmigration; some change the subject, othersmeeklyape the farright. Butin the Netherlandsthe two partiesthatperformed moststronglycompared to the 2012 election—D66, a collection ofear-nestpro-European liberals, and GreenLeft, a once-fringe amal-gam ofradicalsand environmentalists—succeeded bytaking MrWilderson directly. GreenLeftatleasttripled itsnumber ofseats.D66 won 19 seatsand runsstrongin everyDutch city.One ofthe campaign’smosttellingmomentscame duringadebate ofpartyleaderson March 5th. Asked whethertheyagreedthatthe Netherlandswasfailingto “protectitsown culture”, mostmuttered aboutthe decline ofvaluesorthe national anthem. ButJesse Klaver, the 30-year-old GreenLeftleader, said he agreed withthe proposition, and wenton to describe a vision ofnationalidentitycentred on tolerance, opennessand internationalismthathe claimed wasundersiege from the right. Viewers declaredhisperformance the bestofthe night. “It’sa newkind ofpatrio-tism,” saysMarjolein Meijer, the GreenLeftchair. Asfor D66, nootherpartyhasso stronglystood up to MrWilders’scalumnies. Dutch politicsistoo complexand fragmented to providestraightforward lessons. Thirteen partieswon seatsthis week; thecoalition thateventuallyemergesmaywell resemble the centristgovernmentsthathave run the Netherlandsfordecades(al-though with fourorﬁve partiesitwill struggle forcoherence). Ifacosmopolitan-nationalistdivide hasemerged, ithasnot so muchsupplanted the old left-rightaxisascomplemented it, suggestsCasMudde, a political scientistatthe UniversityofGeorgia. Yetthe Dutch have often served aspolitical bellwethers forotherpartsofEurope. Withoutthe roadblocksofparliamentarythresholdsorcomplexvotingsystems, social changescan ﬁndpolitical expression quickerthan in othercountries. GreenLeftand D66 have exploited the political space opened up by the col-lapse ofthe traditional centre-left—the LabourParty, the juniorco-alition partner, lostthree-quartersofitsseatsthisweek—and theright’sfailure to resistthe populisttemptation. Brexit and MrTrump presented them with cautionarytalesalmostaspotent asthe threatfrom MrWilders. The Dutch mayhave avoided a seriousrupture. Butthe poli-ticsofidentitystill hasthe powerto divide. Two years ago “Sep-arate Worlds”, a reportbytwo governmentthink-tanks, warnedofa driftto American-style polarisation between an educatedelite thatisenthusiasticoverglobalisation and a remainingclassofpoorerDutch rooted in place and tradition. Those parties thatsitﬁrmlyinside one orotherofthese bubbleswere among the bigwinnersthisweek(only14% ofthose with little education wentforD66 orGreenLeft; MrWildershoovered up thisgroup’svotes). And Dutch identitypoliticshasfound a third, more worryingdimension in the emergence ofDenk, a partycateringspeciﬁcallyto Dutch Muslims. Karina, a youngMoroccan Dutchwoman but-tonholed byCharlemagne asshe emerged from a mosque serv-ingasa pollingstation in Amsterdam, explained thatshe used tovote Labourbefore MessrsWildersand Trump leftherfearing forherfreedom to don the headscarf.

Even amongthe 62% ofScotswho voted to Remain lastyear, more than halfthinkthatBrussels’sauthorityshould be curbed. And ofthosewho plumped forindependence in 2014, athird voted to leave the EU.

Late on March 13th theHouse ofCommonsrejected two amend-mentsthathad been proposed bytheLords. Asexpected, the upperhouse thenbacked down. The governmenthad beenhintingbroadlythatthe lettertriggering Ar-ticle 50 would be sentto Brusselsimmedi-ately. On March 14th MrsMaydulyhailedthe bill’spassage into lawas“a deﬁningmomentforourwhole country”.Butthen came anticlimax: DowningStreetsaid the invocation ofArticle 50would actuallyhappen onlyin the weekofMarch 27th. Before then, MrsMayplansto visitScotland, Walesand Northern Ire-land. All beingwell, she will still fulﬁl thepromise she made lastOctoberofstartingthe Brexitprocessbythe end ofMarch.Adelayoftwo weeksin a negotiationdue to lasttwo yearsmaysound trivial. Yetaplan in Brusselsto hold a special EUsum-miton April 6th to discussMrsMay’sletterhad to be hastilyjunked. The meeting willnowtake place in earlyMay, losingalmostfourweeksoutofwhatisalreadyan ex-tremelytighttimetable.So whydid MrsMaypull backatthe lastminute? Afterall, there wasnevergoing tobe a perfectmomentto invoke Article 50.Doingso justbefore the Dutch election onMarch 15th mighthave bolstered the far-rightanti-EUpartyofGeertWilders. Actingtoo close to the 60th anniversarycelebra-tion ofthe TreatyofRome on March 25thmighthave seemed provocative. Frenchand, later, German electionsalso loom inthe nearfuture.The truth seemsto be thatMrsMay’splanswere upsetbyScotland’sﬁrstminis-ter, Nicola Sturgeon, who chose to an-nounce on March 13th thathergovernmentwould askfora second independence ref-erendum (see previousstory). She citedBrexitasthe “material change” to justifythisdemand. And she attacked MrsMayforchoosingto pursue a hard Brexitthatwill take Britain outofthe EU’ssingle mar-ket, when a majorityofScotshad voted tostayin the EUlastJune. The realityisthatBrexitisunwelcomenotjustto MsSturgeon butto all of Brit-ain’sEuropean partners. Even asthey holdtheir60th birthdayparty—which MrsMaywill notattend—theyknowthatthe club isin deep trouble, notleastbecause so manycountriesbesidesBritain have seen an up-surge ofpopulistanti-EUparties. To mostotherEUcountries, indeed, Brexitisjustone more ingredientin a cocktail ofoftenmore pressingproblemsthataﬄictthem.In thiscontext, indeed, some may takequietsatisfaction from seeingthe Scotsruin MrsMay’splan to triggerArticle 50. Afewmayeven see the risingriskofabreak-up ofthe United Kingdom assuit-able punishmentforBrexiteers. Yetno-bodywill much enjoythe Article 50 nego-tiationswhen theyeventuallystart.Atthe same time feware convinced byMrsMay’srepeated mantra thatno deal isbetterthan a bad deal, which theysee asjustan attemptto bolsterBritain’sweakbargainingposition. On March 15th DavidDavis, the Brexitsecretary, admitted to theCommonsBrexitcommittee thatsince thereferendum the governmenthad made noforecastsofthe economicconsequences ofleavingthe EUwithouta deal and revert-ingto trade underWorld Trade Organisa-tion rules. Thatmakesiteven harder to seehowMrsMaycan justifyherclaim.Norare the parliamentarymanoeuvresoverBrexitﬁnished. Thisweekitemergedthatatleastseven billsbesidesthe planned“GreatRepeal Bill” will be needed to giveeﬀectto Brexit. MrDavishasalso concededthatanydeal negotiated underArticle 50would require parliamentaryapproval.And although Lord Bridges, a Brexitminis-ter, said in the Lordsthathe found it hard tosee howParliamentcould hold a vote ifthere were no deal, even thatcould beopen to question. Lord Hope hasdeclaredthatthe Supreme Courtjudgmentwhichforced the governmentto bringforwardthe Article 50 bill mayrequire furtherprimarylegislation before Brexitactuallyhappens.

Theywill scarcelyhave been re-assured when Francislastmonth encour-aged a gatheringofprieststo showunder-standingforparishionerswho were livingtogetherbefore marriage. On March 10thhe again shocked traditionalists, sugges-ting thatthe church mightordain marriedmen to help lessen an acute shortage ofpriests.Asecond, much smallerband ofcriticsismade up ofVatican-based clerics, whoseobjection isto the pope’streatmentofhisoﬃcials. Itisno secretthathe has little sym-pathywith the Vatican. Asarchbishop ofBuenosAires, he wasrepeatedlyfrustratedin hisdealingswith itsbureaucrats. Soonafterhiselection aspope, he formed a teamofcardinalsto advise him on howto re-form the Roman Curia, pointedlychoosingmostofthem from amongpastoral leadersbeyond the Vatican’shigh walls. Acting onitsrecommendations, he setup two new“super-ministries”, orsecretariats, one forthe Vatican’sﬁnancesand the otherfor itsmedia operations, and merged sixsmaller“ministries” into two.Thatalone would have earned Francisenemiesin an organisation asnotoriouslyresistantto change asthe Roman Curia.

CIAM alsoallegesa “darkerside” to Dis-ney’sbehaviour, suggestingthe Americanﬁrm should reimburse over€900m in feesand royaltiesforthe Disneybrand thatwere charged to itsEuropean outﬁtoverthe years.

Enough, atleast, to supercharge a debate about thefuture role ofbatteriesin the world’senergymix.Elon Musk, a Silicon Valleyentrepre-neur(pictured), maybe bestknown forhisgravity-defyingambition, buthis coreproductisthebattery: whetherforhisTesla cars, forthe homeorforgrid-scaleelectricitystorage. He gave the last ofthese an unexpected joltofpublicity onMarch 10th, byrespondingto a blackout-inspired challenge on Twitterfrom anAustralian software billionaire, MikeCannon-Brookes. MrMusksaid he couldinstall 100 megawatthours(MWh) ofbatterystorage in the state ofSouth Aus-tralia in 100 daysto help solve an energycrisisitfaces, oritwould be free ofcharge.“Thatseriousenough foryou?” he asked. In response, Malcolm Turnbull, theprime minister, communicated with MrMuskand appeared to turn from pro-coalscepticinto batterybeliever. On March14th JayWeatherill, the premierofSouthAustralia, wentfurther. Declaringthat thenational electricitymarketwas“broken”,he said the state would launch itsownA$550m ($415m) plan to build a 100MWbatterysystem,aswell asa gas-ﬁredpowerstation, with publicfunds. MrMuskmayhave gotwhathe wanted. Heis“good atbringingnerdysubjectsto abroad audience”, saysJulia Attwood ofBloombergNewEnergyFinance. Are batteriesnowcheap enough to beacost-eﬀective wayofsolvingenergycriseslike thatin southern Australia,broughton since Julybystorms, heat-waves, the intermittencyofsolarandwind powerand the closure ofcoal- andgas-ﬁred powerstations? The answer,saysMichael Ottaviano ofCarnegieClean Energy, which ishopingto sell itsown grid-scale batterysystemsto thestate, is“no”—especiallyundercurrentmarketstructures.True, batterypriceshave plummetedand MrMusk’sprice, ofabout$250 perkilowatthour(kWh), isrelativelycheap.Butthe total cost(includingbuilding theplant, forexample) would be about$500perkWh to hookthe batteriesup to thegrid. A100MWh facilitywould cost$50m. Onlywhen powerpricesreachstratosphericlevelswould thatinvest-mentmake sense fora utility. That’swhythe governmentofSouth Australia ishavingto stump up instead. Eventually,practitionershope thatchangesto thepowermarketwill make batterystorageviable withoutpublicfunding. “Thisisashort-term Band-Aid until the regulatoryprocesscatchesup,” MrOttaviano says.Butithasall sparked a discussionaboutbatteriesthatwill keep going (andgoing). On March 13th GTM, a consultan-cy, and the EnergyStorage Association, atrade body, said thatbatteryinstallationsin America, led byutility-scale storage,doubled to 336MWh bythe end of2016.Much wasin California, reactingto theblowoutofthe Aliso Canyon gasplant in2015.

In 2013 shehelped found Zai Lab, which licenseslate-stage drugsfrom Western pharma compa-niesto develop and sell in China. Zai Labalso aimsto develop innovative medicinesin immuno-oncology. Anotherﬁrm attractingattention isBei-Gene, an oncologyﬁrm based in Beijing,which hasfourclinical-stage drugcandi-datesand which raised $158m in an IPOlastyear. Chi-Med’sFruquintinib mayeven be beaten in the race to approval inAmerica and Japan bya cancerdrugcalledEpidaza from Chipscreen BiosciencesofShenzhen. China approved itin 2015.

Itsretreatcomeson theheelsofBoston, Rome and Hamburgcan-ningtheirbidswithin the pasttwo years,whittlinga once-crowded pool ofcandi-date citiesdown to onlytwo: LosAngeles—itselfa replacementforthe torpedoed Bos-ton bid—and Paris. The situation oughtto feel familiar bynowto the International OlympicCom-mittee (IOC), the governingbodyofthegames. Afterlotsofcitiesbowed out ofthecompetition forthe 2022 wintergamesitwasagain leftwith two options: Almaty,Kazakhstan and Beijing, China. The pros-pectofhavingno biddersforfutureevents—orofhavinga biddingcontest be-tween autocratseagerto hosta vanity pro-ject—seemslikelierthan itonce did.Astudyin 2016 from the UniversityofOxford’sSaïd BusinessSchool found thatfrom 1960-2016 (when data were available),the average costoverrun ofhostingthegameswas156%, the highestofanymega-project. Tokyo hasalreadyseen itscostsrise to ¥3trn ($26bn), fourtimesthe origi-nal estimate. The IOC’scontractwith hostcitiesincludesa taxpayerguarantee, whichputsthem on the hookforoverruns. There isno end ofenthusiasm fromsponsorsortelevision broadcastersto payfatsumsto aﬃliate themselveswith theOlympicbrand. Broadcastersare still mak-ingthe betthatlive sportswill continue tofascinate TVaudiences. Comcast, the par-entcompanyofNBCUniversal, an Ameri-can television company, paid a whopping$7.75bn forexclusive broadcastrights to thegamesfrom 2022-2032. Butthe IOCpocketsan ever-greatershare ofthese revenues: to-dayitgiveslessthan 30% oftelevision rev-enuesto the hostcity. In 1992, bycontrast, itgave Barcelona 69% ofthe broadcastspoils(see chart). Ifno citieswish to hostthe games, how-ever, thismodel isunsustainable. The IOChasbeen here before. Interestin hostingthe ﬁve-ringed circuswaned in the 1970saftera seriesofgamestainted byterroristattacks, cripplingdebtand boycotts. LosAngeleswasthe sole bidderforthe 1984event. PeterUeberroth, the businessmanheadingitsbid, ripped up the taxpayerguarantee and imposed spartan condi-tions, such ashousingathletesin universi-tydormitories. The gamesturned a proﬁtforthe city, of$215m. Could similarlyradical reform save thedayagain? In 2014 the IOCpassed Agenda2020, changesthattryto make the gamesmore aﬀordable. Theyhave made little dif-ference. AfterBudapestwithdrewitsbid,the IOCsaid in a statementthatpoliticswere to blame, before concedingthatfur-theradjustmentsto the biddingprocesswould need to be made because “the cur-rentprocedure producestoo manylosers.” Itcould simplytinkerwith the existingmodel and give a largershare ofitsrev-enuesto the hostcity, orpromise to coveraportion ofa city’scostoverruns. Some sug-gesta more decentralised hostingmodel,with diﬀerentOlympiceventstakingplacein those citiesaround the world that havethe rightsportsinfrastructure forthem.Thiswould spread the costsmore widelyand decrease the probabilityofwhite ele-phants. Butbroadcasterswould bearthecostofsettingup teamsaround the world. The reallyradical answerwould be todesignate one ora fewpermanenthost cit-iesso thatthe Olympicssportsinfrastruc-ture hasa life beyond the extinguishing ofthe Olympicﬂame. Christine Lagarde,managingdirectorofthe InternationalMonetaryFund, hasspoken favourablyofthisidea. The proposal isnotnew.

In each ofthe pasttwo years, the Federal Reserve has pre-dicted multiple interest-rate rises, only tobe thrown oﬀ-course byevents. On March15th the central bankraised itsbenchmarkFederal Fundsrate forthe third time sincethe ﬁnancial crisis, to a range of0.75-1%.Thiswas, ifanything, ahead ofitsforecast,which itreaﬃrmed, thatrateswould risethree timesin 2017. “Lift-oﬀ” isatlastan aptmetaphorformonetarypolicy. ButasJanetYellen, the Fed’schairwoman, picksupspeed in termsofpolicy, she mustnavigateacloudypolitical outlook. The nextyearwill deﬁne herlegacy.MsYellen tookoﬃce in February 2014afterditheringbythe Obama administra-tion overa choice between herand LarrySummers, a formertreasurysecretary. Left-wingerspreferred MsYellen, in partbe-cause she seemed more likelyto give jobspriorityoverstable prices. Indeed, Repub-licansin Congressworried thatshe wouldbe too softon inﬂation. The Economistcalled herthe “ﬁrstacknowledged dove” tolead the central bank.TodayMsYellen looksmore hawkish—certainlythan MrSummers, who regularlyurgesthe Fed to keep rateslow. Headlineinﬂation hasrisen to 1.9% a year; butex-cludingvolatile food and energyprices itisabitstuck, ataround 1.7%. YetMsYellen hasnotreallychanged herplumage. Asexpect-ed, she hasconsistentlygiven high weightto unemployment. Before herappoint-ingratesup byatleastone percentagepointoverthe year. Butinﬂation remainedstrangelytepid (see chart). Cheap oil and astrongdollarwere partlyto blame. Butwagesalso seemed stuck. MsYellen andhercolleaguesdeduced thatunemploy-mentcould safelyfall a bitfurther.In the end, theyraised ratesonce in2015, in December. Again, theyforecastfourrate risesforthe nextyear. This timetheywere delayed byworriesoverthe glo-bal economy(China wobbled earlyin2016). Oﬃcialsalso began to see lowerratesasa permanentfeature ofthe econ-omy. Today, the settersthinkrateswilleventuallystabilise at3%, down from aforecastof4% when MsYellen tookoﬃce.MsYellen’sFed, then, hasproved verywillingto change course. And thistime theFed isspeedingup, ratherthan postponing,rate rises. Three factorsare atplay. First, theglobal economyhasbeen reﬂatingsincethe middle of2016 (see Brieﬁng, page 18).Second, ﬁnancial marketsare booming,boostingthe economybyalmostasmuchasthree interest-rate cuts, bysome esti-ment, when joblessnesswashigh, shewanted the Fed to promise to keep rateslowforlongerthan itthen planned. Nowthatunemploymentisjust4.7%, she iskeenerto raise ratesthan those who worryaboutstubbornlylowinﬂation.In March 2015 MsYellen argued that,were the Fed to ignore a tightlabour mar-ket, inﬂation would eventuallyovershootits2% target. The Fed mightthen need toraise ratessharplyto bringitbackdown,riskinga recession—and hence more un-employment. Betterto liftratesin advance. Unemployment, however, wasalreadydown to 5.5%.

Thisobscure policy rateissurprisinglycontroversial. Jeb Hensar-ling, the Republican chairofthe congres-sional committee thatoverseesthe Fed,hascalled ita “subsidy” to some ofthelargestbanksin America. To understand the argument, considerthe Fed’syear-end ﬁnancial statement. In2016 itearned $111.1bn in interestincomeon itsvastportfolio ofsecurities. Butitalso paid JPMorgan Chase, WellsFargo,and othermostlybigbanks$12bn inintereston excesscash deposited at re-gional Federal Reserve banks. Such IOERpaymentsare both woefullyunpopularand critical to the Fed’smonetarypolicy.Overa decade ago, to give the Fedbettercontrol ofshort-term interest rates,Congressauthorised itto payinterest onfundsin excessofthose banksneed tomeetreserve requirements. The policywasﬁrstused duringthe ﬁnancial crisisin 2008. Buttoday, IOERisthe Fed’sprim-arymonetary-policytool, essential to itssettingofthe Federal Fundsrate. IOER hasdrawn ﬁerce ﬂakfrom Con-gress. Ifbankscan parktheirmoney atthe Fed, theyseem to have lessincentiveto lend to ﬁrmsand consumers. Abouthalfofall excessreservesare held byAmerica’s25 largestbanks, with a third,to Congress’shorror, held byforeignbanks. The two groupsearn roughly85%ofthe Fed’sinterestpayment.Manyanalystsargue thatthese in-terestpayments—amountingto lessthan2% ofthe banks’ total income—are in facttrivial. Theyclaim bankswould ratherearn higherreturnselsewhere, and thatthe real winnerfrom the currentarrange-mentisthe government. The excessreserveshelp ﬁnance the Fed’s$4.5trnbalance-sheet, which generated almosteighttimesmore income forthe Treasuryin 2016 than waspaid outin interest. Thisdebate islikelyto intensify. Amer-ican bankshold over$2.1trn in excessreserves. Asratesrise, the costof payingintereston them will climb—to $27bn thisyear, accordingto Fed projectionsand$50bn by2019 (see chart). Thatmaybetoo much. MarkCalabria ofthe CatoInstitute, a think-tank, saysthatanythingthatcan be tagged as“payingbanks$50bn a yearnotto lend” will be “politi-callyunsustainable”. Meddlingwith the arrangementmightcosteven more. WithoutIOER,bankswould tryto lend theirexcessreservesto each other, so short-terminterestrateswould collapse. To keepcontrol ofmonetarypolicy—and avert asurge in inﬂation—the Fed would have tosell assetsrapidlyto withdrawreservesfrom the system. The disruption, a recentanalysisconcluded, could prove “ex-tremelycostlyto taxpayers”.Acritical tool forsetting American monetarypolicycomes underﬁreExcessive?Source: Federal ReserveInterest paid to banks on their excess reserves$bn01020304050200810121416182022FORECAST25mates. Third, a ﬁscal stimulusislooming.Accordingto the Fed’smodel, a taxcutworth 1% ofGDPwould push up interestratesbynearlyhalfa percentage point.Duringhiscampaign Donald Trump prom-ised cutsworth nearly3% ofGDP, accord-ingto the TaxPolicyCentre, a think-tank. Dovesinsistthatthe Fed riskshalting anincomplete recovery. Before the crisis of2007-08, about80% of25-to 54-year-olds(the “prime age” population) had jobs. To-daythe proportion is78%. The diﬀerence isabout2.5m potential workers, mostlynotcounted asunemployed because theyarenotlookingforwork. Were the Fed to aimforthe nearly82% prime-age employmentseen in April 2000, the jobsshortfallwould looktwice ashigh.In OctoberMsYellen wondered aloudwhethera “high-pressure economy”, and aresultingwage boom, mightcoaxmorepeople to seekwork. Thisled to reports—soon corrected—thatshe would lettheeconomyoverheatafterall. In factMs Yel-len haslongwarned thatmanydrivers oflabour-force participation are beyond thecentral bank’scontrol. Agentle pickup inwage growth since mid-2015 seemsto sup-portherviewthatunemploymentisthebestmeasure ofeconomicslack.Rarelyhasunemploymentbeen thislowwithoutinﬂation takingoﬀ. Once wasin the late 1990s, when Alan Greenspan, aformerFed chairman, correctlypredictedthatrisingproductivitywould stop aboominglabourmarketfrom stokinginﬂa-tion. JeﬀreyLacker, chairman ofthe Rich-mond Fed, recentlyoﬀered anotherexam-ple. In 1965 unemploymentfell to 4%,while inﬂation wasonly1.5%. Yetpricestookoﬀin the yearsthatfollowed: by 1968,inﬂation had reached 4.3%.ThatiswhatMsYellen wantsto avoid.Butthe Fed hasnotoften managed to tight-en monetarypolicywithoutan ensuing re-cession. Should she manage it, hertenurewill go down asa greatsuccess.Thatis, ifshe hastime to ﬁnish the job.Herterm endsin February2018. IfMrTrump replacesher, she could stayon asaboard member. Butshe would probablyleave. So would StanleyFischer, the Fed’svice-chairman, whose term expiresfourmonthslater. Two ofthe Fed’sseven seatsare alreadyvacant, and Daniel Tarullo, thede facto vice-chairman forregulation, goesin April. So MrTrump maybe able to ap-pointﬁve governors, includingthe chair-man, within 18 monthsoftakingoﬃce.Whatthen formonetarypolicy, and forMsYellen’slegacy? Duringhiscampaign,the presidentattacked the Fed forkeepingrateslowand said he would replace MsYellen with a Republican. Mooted succes-sorsinclude Glenn Hubbard, who advisedGeorge W. Bush; Kevin Warsh, a formerbankerand Fed governor; and John Taylor,an academicand authorofa rule, namedafterhim, forsettinginterestrates.Akettle ofhawksAll these potential successorsare mone-tary-policyhawks. Some versionsoftheTaylorrule, forexample, call forinterestratesmore than three timesashigh as to-day’s. MrTrump, who promisesrevivaland 3.5-4% economicgrowth, mightnotlike the sound ofthat. If, like most popu-lists, he wantsto avoid tightmoney, hecould appointsomeone malleable to theFed. Butthatwould also be risky. Onecause ofthe inﬂationarysurge ofthe 1960s,notesMrLacker, waspolitical pressure tokeep policyloose even afterill-timed taxcuts. On one occasion, PresidentLyndonJohnson summoned the Fed chairman,William McChesneyMartin, to berate himforraisinginterestrates(and to drive himaround hisranch atbreakneckspeed).Asimplerwayto keep hawkish Repub-licansatbaywould be to reappointMs Yel-len. With MrTarullo outofthe frame, MrTrump would still be able to impose his de-regulatoryagenda, yetkeep faith with MsYellen to setmonetarypolicy. Senatorswould struggle to come up with reasonsnotto reappointa central-bankchairwom-an so close to achievinghergoals. Bill Clin-ton and BarackObama reappointed in-cumbentRepublican chairmen. Itmight bein MrTrump’sinterestto reciprocate. 772FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistMarch18th20171ITSHOULD have been a happyanniver-sary.

MostAfrican countries, unfortunately, are noneofthose things.The oldestand largestAfrican fund,Botswana’s$5.3bn Pula Fund, wascreatedin 1994 from diamond revenues. Angolaand Nigeria, the biggestoil exporters, haveboth established fundsin the pastfewyears; governmentsfrom Kenya to Zambiaare talkingofdoingthe same. Even Rwan-da, with no greatcommodityriches, is so-licitingpatrioticdonationsto build itsown(civil servantscoughed up $2.5m lastyear).Manyfundshave savingsmandates.Botswana’s, like Norway’s, hoardsitswealth abroad.

Arecentsurveyofinstitutional inves-torsshowed three-quarterswere eitherusingorevaluatingthe approach. By theend ofJanuarysome $534bn wasinvestedin smart-beta exchange-traded funds, ac-cordingto ETFGI, a research ﬁrm. Com-pound annual growth in assetsundermanagementin the sectorhasbeen 30%overthe pastﬁve years.The bestargumentforsmart-betafundsisthattheysimplyreplicate, atlow-ercost, whatfund managersare doing al-ready. Forexample, manyfund managersfollowthe “value” approach, seekingoutsharesthatlookcheap. Acomputerpro-gram can pickthese stocksmore methodi-callythan an erratichuman. Asmart-betafund doeswhatitsayson the tin.Butdoesitwork? The dangerhere is“data mining”. Carryoutenough statisti-cal tests, and youwill alwaysﬁnd somestrategythatworked in the past. It maybethatstocksbeginningwith the letter “M”have outperformed otherlettersofthe al-phabet; thatdoesnotmean theywill doso in future. Accordingto ElroyDimson ofCambridge Universityand Paul Marshand Mike Staunton ofthe London Busi-nessSchool, researchershave found 316diﬀerentfactorsthatmightform the basisfora successful investmentstrategy.The best-known fall into fourgroups—size, value (includingdividend yield), mo-mentum (buyingstocksthathave risen inthe recentpast) and volatility(buyingless-riskyshares). Research byMessrsDimson, Marsh and Staunton showsthatthe size, value and momentum eﬀectshaveworked acrossa wide range ofmarketsovermanydecades. The low-volatility ef-fect(forwhich fewerdata are available)hasworked in America and Britain over anextended period.In the case ofmomentum, the eﬀect isverylarge. In a theoretical exercise (seechart), an investoridentiﬁesthe best-per-formingstocksoverthe previoussixmonths, buysthe winnersand sellsshortthe losers(ie, betsthattheirprices will fall).The exercise assumesittakesa month toimplementthe strategyeach time. In somecountries, the return ismore than 1% amonth; globally, itis0.79% a month, ornearly10% a year. Thatismore than suﬃ-cientto make up foranytransaction costs. Thisisa bitofa mystery. Even if marketsare notcompletelyeﬃcient, itseems hardto understand howoutsize returnscan beachieved bylookingatsomethingassim-ple asrecentprice movements, withoutclevertraderstakingadvantage until theanomalyvanishes. One explanation maybe thatthe eﬀectcan go sharplyinto re-verse; in 2009 a broad-based momentumapproach would have lost46% in the Brit-ish stockmarketand 53% in America. Anyhedge fund thatused borrowed money toexploitthe momentum eﬀectwould havebeen wiped out.Similarly, smallercompaniesand val-ue stockshave beaten the marketover thelongrun. Nevertheless, there have beentimeswhen such shareshave been out offavourforyears. The returnsfrom suchstrategieshave been much lowerthanfrom momentum (2-4% a year): notenough, perhaps, to induce a patient buy-and-hold strategyamongthose willing toride outthe bad times. The obviousansweristo selecttherightfactorsatthe rightmoment. The ob-viousquestion ishowto do so. Relying onpastperformance isrisky. Astudy* byRe-search Aﬃliates, a fund-managementgroup, found thata factor’smostrecentﬁve-yearperformance wasnegativelycorrelated with itssubsequentreturn.Thisisprobablya case ofreversion to themean. Stocksthatperform well over ﬁveyearsare probablyovervalued bythe endofthatperiod; those thatperform badlyforthe same period are probablycheap.

The high level ofinventoriesis vital toan understandingofwhycrude pricessud-denlyplummeted thismonth, according tothe International EnergyAgency(IEA), aforecaster. WestTexasIntermediate is backbelow$50 a barrel, itslevel before OPECinNovemberagreed to cutoutput(see chart).Three reasonsexplain whythe tanksare so full. Firstly, OPEC’sagreementwithnon-memberssuch asRussia to cutpro-duction from January1stsetoﬀa ﬂurry ofhedge-fund buying, pushingoil priceshigher. American shale producerswerequickto take advantage ofhigherprices bypumpingmore oil. The numberofAmeri-can oil rigshasrisen to 617 from 386 a yearago, producing400,000 barrelsa daymorethan atthe lowsin September. Much ofthathasgone to storage terminalslikeCushing, Oklahoma.Second, OPEChasbeen hoisted byitsown petard. In the monthsbefore itstartedcuttingoutput, itsharplyraised productionand exports. Afterweeksoftrans-Atlantictravel, thisoil isshowingup in higherAmerican imports, putinto storage whenreﬁnerieswere idled formaintenance. The third factoristhe shape ofthe curveoffuturesprices, which iscloselyrelated tothe level ofinventories. When OPECor-chestrated the Januarycut, ithoped to re-balance supplyand demand bymid-year,and push the futuresmarketinto “back-wardation”, meaningpricesin the longterm were ata discountto short-termprices. Backwardation reﬂectsthe market’swillingnessto buyoil and use itrather thanstoringit. The strategyworked fora while.Butsince the release ofbearish Ameri-can inventorydata on March 8th, the mar-ketslipped backinto “contango”, the nameforthe discountatwhich near-term pricestrade to longer-term ones. Contangomakesitmore worthwhile to buyoil andstore it. HillaryStevenson ofGenscapenotesthatthe storage costsin tanks inCushingare about41centsperbarrel of oilpermonth, compared with a one-monthcontango ofabout65 cents.Contango can be a self-fulﬁlling proph-ecy, because the more oil isstored, the low-ershort-term pricesgo.

Workerswho migrate from poorcountriesto richonestypicallyearn vastlymore than theycould have in theircountryoforigin. In a paperpublished in 2009, economistsesti-mated the “place premium” a foreign workercould earn in Amer-ica relative to the income ofan identical workerin his nativecountry.

From time to time, though, they biteahuman instead—forexample, when log-gersbringthose canopiescrashingto theforestﬂoor.

The bodycount, he reckons,could reach tensofthousands. And thistime, people are dyingaswell. Since De-cember, 371human cases, a third ofthemfatal, have been recorded. The reason issimilarto the cause ofthe toll in monkeys:lackofan appropriate immune response.The absence ofurban-cycle disease meansthatlocal vaccination campaignshavewound down.

This issimilarto the waythata digital camera’slensfocusessuch an image onto a retina-like light-sensormade up ofmillions ofin-dividual detectors. Othercreatures,though—insectsamongthem—have com-pound eyes. These are composed ofunitscalled ommatidia. Each ommatidium con-sistsofa tinylens, called a facet, and a fewreceptorcells. The eye itselfisa bulbousstructure composed ofmanyofthese om-matidia arrayed together. Individual om-matidia detectpointsoflight, which actasthe pixelsfrom which the creature’sbrainweavesa complete image. Compoundeyesgenerallyhave worse resolutionsthan single-lenseyes, buttheirshape pro-videsa widerﬁeld ofview, which is usefulforspottingfood and predators. The eyesofX. peckii, however, are acompromise between these two extremes.Theyhave a few, large facetsand instead ofdetectingpointsoflightthe ommatidiaeach create an actual image ofpartof theeye’sﬁeld ofview.

Asfar astheycan tell, ithasneverbeen repeated.Similarunrepeated signalshave sincebeen noted elsewhere in the heavens. Sofar, 17 such “fastradio bursts” (FRBs) havebeen recognised.

But, asManasvi Lingam ofHarvardUniversityand Abraham Loeb ofthe Har-vard-Smithsonian Centre forAstrophysicsobserve, there isatleastone further pos-sibility: alien spaceships.Speciﬁcally, the two researchers sug-gest, in a paperto be published in Astro-physical Journal Letters, thatFRBsmightbegenerated bygiantradio transmitters de-signed to push such spaceshipsaround.With the rotation ofthe galaxiesin whichthese transmittersare located, the trans-mitter-beamssweep acrossthe heavens.Occasionally, one washesoverEarth, pro-ducingan FRB.Thisidea isnotcompletelymad. Hu-man rocketscientistshave toyed withsomethingsimilar, in orderto overcomeone ofthe biggestproblemsofspaceshipdesign: thata craftpropelled bya rocketmotormustcarryitsfuel with it. Fuel hasmass. Thatmassmustbe moved bymorefuel—which addsmore massto the craft,which thusneedsstill more fuel. And soon. Forthisreason, 90% ormore ofa con-ventional rocket’slaunch massisitsfuel.Itispossible, though, to separate thefuel from the craft. Thatisthe principle be-hind a solarsail, which employsthe gentlepressure exerted bysunlightto propel a ve-hicle. Anippieralternative isto use fo-cused lightbeamsto provide the pressure.Yuri Milner, a Russian billionaire with along-standinginterestin science, is payingforresearch into such a machine. He pro-posesto drive a tinyprobe to Alpha Cen-tauri, one ofEarth’sneareststellarneigh-bours, usingbanksofpowerful lasers.DrLingam and DrLoeb suggestFRBsmightbe the resultofvastlybiggertakes onthe same principle, exceptthattheyem-ploythe radio portionsofthe electromag-neticspectrum ratherthan visible light.The two researchershave worked outwhatwould be needed ifthe transmitterbehind such a burstwere solar-powered.Theycalculate thatthe amountofsunlightfallingonto a planetabouttwice the size ofEarth, and atthe rightdistance from itsstarto have liquid wateron itssurface, wouldyield enough energyto accelerate a space-ship weighinga million tonnesorso to aspeed close to thatoflightbefore the pro-pulsion beam became too attenuated topropel itanyfaster. Thiswould be perfectforferryinglarge numbersofbeingsfromone starsystem to another, aslongas therewasan equivalentdevice atthe other endto slowthe craftdown again.To checkwhethersuch a machine istechnologicallyplausible, the two re-searcherscalculated thatthe necessaryplanet-sized arrayofradio transmitterscould be keptcool bynothingmore exoticthan ordinarywater. So, asfarasthey cansee, while buildingsuch a machine wouldbe a heroicfeatofengineering, nothing inthe lawsofphysicsactuallyforbidsit. Sayingthatthe featuresofFRBsare con-sistentwith theirbeingsignsofan alienspace-propulsion system isnot, ofcourse,the same assayingthatthisiswhatthey ac-tuallyare. One earlyexplanation ofpul-sars—regularcosmicradio signalsﬁrst ob-served in 1967 wasthattheywere alienradio beacons. Theylaterturned outto becaused byfast-spinningneutron stars. Forphysicists, though, thatexplanation wasalmostasinteresting. Aneutron star isonewhose protonsand electronshave mergedwith each otherto create neutrons. These,togetherwith the star’spre-existingneu-trons, resultin an objectthathasno atomsin it. Since atomsare composed mostly ofemptyspace a neutron star, instead of be-ingstarsize, isjusta fewkilometres across.IfFRBsturn outto be even a fraction ascu-riousasthat, mostastronomerswould for-give them fornotbeingartiﬁcial. 7AstronomyFlashes ofinspirationAbatch ofstrange signals from the skymight, justpossibly, be signs ofaliens82ScienceandtechnologyThe EconomistMarch18th2017Animal behaviourSpiderbitesARACHNOPHOBIAisa common andpowerful fear.

Indeed, in 1957William Bristowe, a British arachnologist,wondered whetherBritish spidersmightkill preyequivalentin massto all ofthepeople then livingin Britain.In research published thisweekin theScience ofNature, Martin NyﬀeleroftheUniversityofBasel, in Switzerland, andKlausBirkhoferofLund University, inSweden, attemptto putsome numberson spiders’ dininghabits.

Thatdone, theyextrapolated theirhabitat-based resultsto the whole planet, in lightofwhatisknown aboutthe total areas ofsuch habitats.

Thisputsspidersin the same predatoryleagueashumansasa species, and whalesas agroup. Each ofthese consumes, on anannual basis, in the region of400mtonnesofotheranimals. Somewhere between 400m and500m tonnesisalso the total massofhuman beingsnowalive on Earth. Ap-proximatelyspeaking, then, Bristowewasright.

Thesupplyofdecenttracers, however, is limit-ed. About100, mostlydyesormildlyradio-active materials, are in routine use.

While otherswere writingconfessional poetry, she en-sured thatshe wrote ata distance. Poemswhich in original draftsmentioned charac-teristicsofa loverwere revised, sometimesasmanyas17 times, in orderto make the ﬁ-nal workaspolished and asimpersonal aspossible. She wasa lesbian who neverpubliclyadmitted to the term, even asyoungergaypoetsin the 1970sembraced it(partnerswere friendsoreven a “secre-tary”). She wasan alcoholicwho wasashamed ofherdrinking, butneversoughtlong-term treatment. Poetrywasa way of“thinkingwith one’sfeelings”, butthosefeelingswere often obscured, hidden with-in a parenthesisorwritten from the per-spective ofsomeone verydiﬀerentfromherself. Thisiswhyshe makesa fascinatingsubjectfora biographer.“AMiracle forBreakfast”, the ﬁrstfull-length biographyin two decades, ablymanagesto bringBishop to life.

Bishopherselfwasaware ofthe con-trast, writingto one loverwhile she wasteachingattheUniversityofWashington in1966: “Everyone treatsme withsuch respectand callsme MissB—and everyonce in a while Ifeel a terrible laugh startingdown in mychest…howdif-ferentI am from whattheythink, I’m sure.”Bishop’spastwasindeedmore complicated than manyknew, even those close to her.MsMarshall hashad accesstoapreviouslyunknown troveoflettersthatBishop wrote toherpsychiatristand to variouslovers, which became avail-able afterthe death ofher ex-ecutorand lastlover, AliceMethfessel, in 2009. These de-pictan unsettled, unhappyshe wasalso in love with); Bishop and herloverwere ﬁne, butherfriend, who hadbeen a painter, lostherarmand could notpaintagain. Bishop often drankherselfinto a stupor, starting“the hourbeforedawn”and sometimescontinuingevenuntil she washospitalised. Herpartner ofovera decade, Lota de Macedo Soares, aBrazilian self-taughtlandscape designer,overdosed aftera breakdown partlycaused byBishop’sinﬁdelity. MsMarshall’sskill preventsthisnarra-tive from becomingdepressing. The Bish-op thatemergesfrom hertellingmaybe attimesmorose orashamed ofherdrinking(wishing, asshe wrote to Methfessel, thatshe could be more like writerswho “drinkworse than I do, atleastbadly& all thetime, and don’tseem to have anyregrets orshame—justwrite poemsaboutit”). Butshe also appearsvivacious, attractive andfull oflife. Even the worstheartbreakbroughtoutwonderful poetry, such as hermostfamouspoem, “One Art”, whichstarts: “The artoflosingisn’thard to master;/so manythingsseem ﬁlled with the in-tent/to be lostthattheirloss isno disaster.” Three relationshipsin par-ticularilluminate a lighter sideto Bishop: hertime withSoaresin Brazil, which in-spired some ofherﬁnestwork(“Hidden, oh hidden/in thehigh fog/the house we live in,/beneath the magneticrock…”); herlateryearswithMethfessel; and herfriendshipwith Robert“Cal” Lowell, theone otherwriterwith whomshe immediatelyfeltatease. Bishop ﬁrstmetLowell in1947 ata dinnerpartyin NewYork. Theystayed in touch forthe restoftheirlives, writingover400 lettersto one anoth-er. Lowell supported herandhelped herﬁnd grantsandpostings, and praised herwork. He carried around apoem ofhersin hiswalletas atalisman.

Butthisisa small price to payfora biographywhich atlastilluminatesone ofAmerica’sﬁnest, and mostelusive, poets. 7WHATmakesa hit? Manyassume ithasto do with artistryorluck. Notso,saysDerekThompson, a writerand editoratthe Atlantic. In hisﬁrstbook, “HitMak-ers”, he analysesthe psychologyand eco-nomicsofpop culture and arguesthat“hits”—the thingsthatgeteverybodytalk-ing—are based on three rulesthatrely onmore than creative geniusalone. First, consumerscrave “familiarsur-prises”. Studiesshowthatpeople optforthingstheyrecognise overthingsthey donot. Maybe there isan evolutionaryexpla-nation forthis: survival taughthumansthatiftheyhad seen an animal before, ithad notkilled them yet. Thisfamiliaritywascomforting. The evidence forpeople’sresponse to recognition iseverywhere: theStarWarsfranchise, forexample, isanamalgam ofcharactersand themesfromolderﬁlms. Butitremainsa ﬁne balance, aspeople enjoythinkingtheyhave foundsomethingnew—the “aha” moment, asMrThompson callsit.Second, going“viral” overnightisamyth. Hitsrelyon a seriesofclosely connected events: a celebritypicking up atweetand sharingitwith countlessfollow-ers, forexample. Friendsand familyaloneare unlikelyto help youreach the scale youneed (unless, ofcourse, theyare extremelyinﬂuential). “RockAround the Clock”, arock’n’roll classic, ﬂoundered when it wasﬁrstreleased. Yetthanksto one music-obsessed teenagerand hismovie-starfa-ther, the songwaspicked asthe openingtrackto a notoriousﬁlm called “Black-board Jungle”, which helped itachieve international renown. Third, technologymayevolve, but peo-ple’slongingforthe populardoesnot. Musiclabelsused to bribe radio stations toplaytheirsongs, thusensuringtheir suc-cess. Thismeantthe labelscould dictatethe hits. Todaythe internetoﬀersa seem-inglyinﬁnite repertoire ofreadilyavailablemusic, yetpeople tend to stickto songs thatotherpeople like. One studyfrom Colum-bia Universityfound thata songatthe topofthe chartsstayed there preciselybecausepeople assumed itwasgood. When thechartswere inverted, those previously atthe bottom achieved similarsuccess. Thequalityofthe songisnotasimportant asitsperceived popularity.MrThompson’sthesismightseem ob-vious—a facthe readilyadmits. Exposureand connectionsare important. Butthe ex-tentto which nearlyall blockbusters andpop sensationsowe theirsuccessto thismaybe lessclear-cutthan isgenerally be-lieved. MrThompson’sknackforsupport-ingeach pointwith colourful talesand ex-ampleshelpsmake the bookworthwhile.He explainshow“Bal duMoulin de la Ga-lette” byPierre-Auguste Renoir, which isrevered asone ofthe masterpiecesof theImpressionistmovement, would nothavebeen so withoutGustave Caillebotte, a fel-lowartist. Caillebotte died at45 and leftnearly70 ofhisfriends’ paintingsto theFrench state, includingseveral byRenoir,thushelpingensure hisexposure andeventual critical acclaim. Readersmaydespairatthe injustice ofpublicitybearingmore fruitthan pure tal-ent, butthere are enough unlikelyexam-plesto fosterhope. Indeed, in theory, anyone with the rightmixof“optimalnewness”, wide reach and repeated expo-sure can gettheirluckybreak. Better still, itmightjustbe a hit.7PopularityRecipe forsuccessHit Makers: The Science of Popularity in anAge of Distraction.By Derek Thompson.Penguin Press; 352 pages; $28.

In “The CreativeSpark”, Agustín Fuentes, an anthropologistatthe UniversityofNotre Dame in Indi-ana, arguesthatitisthe powerofimagina-tion, more than anything, thathasmadehumansunique amongthe planet’sbeasts.Thatisa controversial case to make.Man’sdistinctivenesshasbeen attributedto an aptitude forviolence, exceptional in-telligence ora preternatural ability to co-operate. MrFuentescontendsthatthis failsto take into accountthe full range of evi-dence available to researchers. Instead, heturnsto niche construction, a relatively re-centidea in evolutionaryscience thatemerged in the 1980s, butone which, hesays, can oﬀerthe basisofa more completeaccountofhumanity’singenuity. The eco-logical niche thatan organism occupies isthe sum total ofall the interactions thatithaswith itsenvironment. Alteringthat en-vironment, asbeaversdo when theybuilddams, forexample, isniche construction.Humans, MrFuentessays, are “niche con-structorsextraordinaire”.The authorrangesacrossthe creativehistoryofthe human race to lookathowthe specieshasreshaped itssurroundingsto edge ahead ofitscompetitors. He beginswith ancienttoolmaking: the slippery artofsmashingparticularkindsofrockto-getherto make sharp ﬂakesofstone. Thatcomplexprocessgave humansaccesstonewsourcesoffood. Butitmustalso haverequired extensive co-operation, so thatthose noisilycraftingthe toolswould notbe eaten bypredators.Forthose who see “man, the hunter”and “woman, the nurturer” when theyimagine life in the distantpast, MrFuentespointsoutthatthere isno evidence fromarchaeologyto supportthe idea thatroleswere assigned accordingto genderorage.He also disputesa view, recentlypopular-ised in “The BetterAngelsofOurNature”bySteven Pinker, thatmankind hasa natu-ral lustforviolence which hasonlyrecent-lybeen tamed. Proponentsofthatnotionhave largelyignored evidence more than14,000 yearsold, accordingto MrFuentes.He concludesthat, on the contrary, the inci-dence ofmurderand warfare hasin-creased overthe past5,000 years.MrFuentes’sdiscussion ofthe ancientoriginsofscience is, perhaps, the weakestpartofhisbook. He assertsthatearly hu-mansmusthave had a primitive under-standingofthe lawsofphysicsto throw aspearaccurately. Yetno one ascribes scien-tiﬁcthinkingto archerﬁsh because they areable shootdown insectsbyspittingjets ofwateratthem. Otherexamplesofearly sci-entiﬁcthinkingcould betterbe describedasformsofengineering, a processof trialand errorthathasaltogethermore ancientroots. The book’sﬁnal chapter, on what hu-manstodaycan learn from the species’ cre-ative past, isalso a little glib. Overall, itscentral thesis—thatthe powerofthe imagi-nation alone isresponsible forhuman suc-cess—isnotentirelyconvincing.Thatsaid, “The Creative Spark” isstrongon man’simaginative accomplishmentsand oﬀersan importantcorrective to theskewed debate on human nature.

He hadwritten outhisown terse orders: “Acid ac-tion painting. Height7ft. Length 12ft. 6in.Depth 6ft. Materials: nylon, hydrochloricacid, metal. Technique. 3 nylon canvassescoloured white blackred are arranged be-hind each other, in thisorder. Acid is paint-ed, ﬂungand sprayed onto the nylonwhich corrodesatpointofcontactwithin15 seconds.” Thatwasit. The small curiouscrowd then dispersed, reminded—hehoped—ofthe transience ofartand themindlessviolence ofman. Even simplerwas“Construction withglass”. “Materials: glass, metal, adhesivetape. Technique. The glasssheetssuspend-ed byadhesive tape fall on to the concreteground in a pre-arranged sequence.”Crash, the end. Hisdreamswere longer-term, though. He would getlarge, thin steelsheetsmade in a factory, then installed out-side where, overten years, theywould rustaway. Orhe would build a structure of10,000 geometricformsfrom which, con-tinuously, one form would be removed…Artthatconsumed itself, auto-destruc-tive ashe called it, washisown idea. Itledon to an outbreakofperformance artthatisstill lively, aswell asto the briefer punkfashion forsmashingguitarsonstage. Buthe insisted, whateverthe manyscoﬀerssaid, thatitwasnotjustaboutdestruction.Itwasalso aboutcreatingideasbeyond thechaosof“the obscene present”. Hisacid ac-tion painting, forexample, had revealedthrough the shredded canvases(in anar-chy’scolours) newviewsofStPaul’s. “Con-struction with glass” had made newpat-ternsfrom random breakages. Through the1960sand 1970she worked with heat-sen-sitive liquid crystalsand compressed air,showinghowdissolution and fresh forma-tionsexisted side byside. Thatsaid, there wasa lotofanger inhim. HissoftGerman accentdid notsug-gestit, buthiseyesburned. He wasfuriousatconsumerism, capitalism, governments,scientists, economistsand all war-makers.He hated man’sdespoilingofthe planet(hence much workwith cardboard, rub-bish and found objects) and despaired atthe threatofnuclearobliteration. Againstall thishe had tried civil disobedience,joiningthe anti-nuclearmovementin thelate 1950sand goingto prison forit, but atthe same time—inﬂuenced byhisartist-teacherDavid Bomberg—he wasrealisingthatartitselfcould be a social force. Itcouldbe a wayofﬁghting, perhapsnowthe onlyone dissentinghumanshad. The lastpaint-ingshe did, before he turned to sharpermaterials, were ofa household table grad-uallymorphinginto a mushroom cloud. The rootsofall thislayin hisﬁrst 12years. He had spentthem asa Jewish boyin Nuremberg, the cityofNazi rallies,where the polished paradinggrewmoremenacingeach year. Ashisrejection ofmilitarism grew, he found refuge in the for-estsround the city: Nature againsttheforcesofdestruction. Spirited awayin theKindertransportin 1939, while mostofhisfamilywere killed in Buchenwald, he be-came a statelessperson, wanderingroundEngland while ﬁllinghisbrain with Trot-sky. He would be a rovingrevolutionary,he thought. The thoughtpersisted; he re-mained stateless, nevermarried, tended tovanish, had no telephone, carted roundcarrierbagsfull ofpapers, and with hisstragglybeard and bald head could well betaken foran anarchist, ora Bolshevik.The artestablishmentlargelyignoredhim until the mid-1990s, when hisworkbe-gan to seem inﬂuential. To him the art mar-ketwasthe sworn enemy, a place wheremodernism wasmanipulated forproﬁt. In1974 he called foran artists’ strike, and in1977 stopped workingorpromotinghisworkforthree years. No one joined him. In2007 he demanded thatartistsshould stopﬂyingto biennalesabroad. Though he hadoften depended on private showsand sup-portershimself, itwasuncomfortable. Asalast-minute, desperate, subversive actagainsthuman stupidityand cruelty, arthad to be public. Everyone had to see it. He wasone ofthe ﬁrstto tryart withcomputers, butsoon fell outwith them.Cyberneticsinterested him more. One ofhislastworksinvolved a robottaking in-structionsfrom electrical readingsin hisbrain; the robotbored a neathole in a blockofstone. Thisintrigued him, because hewasincreasinglyconcerned bythe void,physical and mental, thatcould follow de-struction. He fretted that, because of pollu-tion and development, children and artistsofthe future would notknowforestsas hehad done. Theywould noteven have thememoryto comfortorinspire them.Memoryand shockTo battle thisnot-knowinghe producedtwo particularworks. “FlailingTrees” fea-tured 21willowsstuckin concrete upsidedown, theirdead rootsscreamingecologi-cal disaster. “HistoricPhotographs” wasaseriesofover-familiarimagesofdeath andwar, each one hidden behind a curtain,wooden slatsora steel plate.

Another, ofthe ramp atAuschwitz,wasso enlarged thatthe viewerwasleft,like the newarrivals, fearful and confused.He meantthe imagesto shockand chal-lenge all overagain: asifthe public, likehim, had passed through pain themselves,ratherthan through art. 7Artas weaponGustavMetzger, inventorofauto-destructive art, died on March 1st, aged 90ObituaryGustav MetzgerHear from the experts, including: MARCH 23RD 2017 | HONG KONGBUSINESS AS A CATALYST FOR CHANGEPRIDE ANDPREJUDICEHow can “reverse mentoring” help CEOs to understand of the business impact of diversity-and-inclusion initiatives?
