The formerbook-selleraccountsformore thanhalfofeverynewdollarspentonline in America. Itistheworld’sleadingproviderofcloud computing. ThisyearAm-azon will probablyspend twiceasmuch on television asHBO, a cable channel. Itsown-brandphysical productsinclude batteries, almonds, suitsand speak-erslinked to a virtual voice-activated assistantthat can control,amongotherthings, yourlampsand sprinkler.YetAmazon’sshareholdersare workingon the premise thatitisjustgettingstarted. Since the beginningof2015 itsshareprice hasjumped by173%, seven timesquickerthan in the twopreviousyears(and 12 timesfasterthan the S&P500 index).With a marketcapitalisation ofsome $400bn, itisthe ﬁfth-most-valuable ﬁrm in the world. Neverbefore hasa companybeen worth so much forso longwhile makingso little money:92% ofitsvalue isdue to proﬁtsexpected after2020. Thatisbecause investorsanticipate both an extraordinaryrise in revenue, from salesof$136bn lastyearto halfa trillionoverthe nextdecade, and a jump in proﬁts. The hopes investedin itimplythatitwill probablybecome more proﬁtable thananyotherﬁrm in America. Ground forscepticism does notcome much more fertile than this: Amazon will have to growfasterthan almostanybigcompanyin modern historyto justi-fyitsvaluation. Can itpossiblydo so?Itiseasyto tickoﬀsome ofthe pitfalls. Rivals will notstandstill. Microsofthascloud-computingambitions; Walmart al-readyhasrevenuesnudging$500bn and isbeeﬁngup online.Ifanythinghappened to JeﬀBezos, Amazon’sfounderandboss, the gap would be exceptionallyhard to ﬁll. But the strik-ingthingaboutthe companyishowmuch ofa chance it hasofachievingsuch unprecedented goals(see pages17-19). Anewsortofbasket-caseThisislargelydue to the ﬁrm’sunusual approach to two di-mensionsofcorporate life. The ﬁrstofthese istime. In an erawhen executivesroutinelywhinge aboutpressure to produceshort-term results, Amazon isresolutelyfocused on the distanthorizon. MrBezosemphasisescontinual investmentto propelitstwo principal businesses, e-commerce and Amazon WebServices(AWS), itscloud-computingarm.In e-commerce, the more shoppersAmazon lures, the moreretailersand manufacturerswantto sell theirgoodson Ama-zon. ThatgivesAmazon more cash fornewservices—such astwo-hourshippingand streamingvideo and music—which en-tice more shoppers. Similarly, the more customersuse AWS,the more Amazon can investin newservices, which attractmore customers. Athird virtuouscircle isstartingto whirlaround Alexa, the ﬁrm’svoice-activated assistant: asdevelop-ersbuild servicesforAlexa, itbecomesmore useful to consum-ers, givingdevelopersreason to create yetmore services.So longasshareholdersretain theirfaith in thismodel, Am-azon’sheadyvaluation resemblesa self-fulﬁllingprophecy.The companywill be able to keep spending, and itsspendingwill keep makingitmore powerful. Theirfaith issustained byAmazon’srecord. Ithashad itsfailures—itsattempt to make asmartphone wasa debacle. Butthe businessisstarting to crankoutcash. Lastyearcashﬂow(before investment) was$16bn,more than quadruple the level ﬁve yearsago.IfAmazon’sapproach to time-framesisunusual, so too isthe sheerbreadth ofitsactivities. The company’slistofcurrentand possible competitors, asdescribed in itsannual ﬁlings, in-cludeslogisticsﬁrms, search engines, social networks, foodmanufacturersand producersof“physical, digital and interac-tive media ofall types”. Awingspan thislarge ismore reminis-centofa conglomerate than a retailer, which makesAmazon’sshare price seem even more bloated: stockmarketstypicallyapplya “conglomerate discount” to reﬂecttheirineﬃciencies. Manyofthese servicessupportAmazon’sown expansionand thatofothercompanies. The obviousexample isAWS,which powersAmazon’soperationsaswell asthose ofotherﬁrms. ButAmazon also rentswarehouse space to other sellers.Itisbuildinga $1.5bn air-freighthub in Kentucky. Itistestingtechnologyin storesto letconsumersskip the cash register al-together, and experimentingwith drone deliveriesto thehome. Such toolscould presumablyserve othercustomers,too. Some thinkthatAmazon could become a newkind of util-ity: one thatprovidesthe infrastructure ofcommerce, fromcomputingpowerto paymentsto logistics.AgiantcannothideAnd here liesthe real problem with the expectationssur-roundingAmazon. Ifitgetsanywhere close to fulﬁlling them, itwill attractthe attention ofregulators. Fornow, Amazon isun-likelyto triggerantitrustaction. Itisnotyetthe biggestretailerin America, itsmostmature market. America’santitrusten-forcerslookmainlyata ﬁrm’seﬀecton consumersand pricing.Seen through thislens, Amazon appearspristine. Consumersapplaud it; itisthe mostwell-regarded companyin America,accordingto a Harrispoll. (AWSisa boon to startups, too.)Butasitgrows, so will concernsaboutitspower. Even onstandard antitrustgrounds, thatmaypose a problem: if itmakesasmuch moneyasinvestorshope, a rough calculationsuggestsitsearningscould be worth the equivalentof 25% ofthe combined proﬁtsoflisted Western retail and media ﬁrms.Butregulatorsare also changingthe waytheythinkabout tech-nology. In Europe, Google standsaccused ofusingits cloutasasearch engine to extend itspowerto adjacentbusinesses. Thecomparative immunityfrom legal liabilityofdigital plat-forms—forthe postingofinﬂammatorycontenton Facebook,say, orthe vettingofdriverson Uber—isbeingchipped away.Amazon’sbusinessmodel will also encourage regulators tothinkdiﬀerently. Investorsvalue Amazon’sgrowth overpro-ﬁts; thatmakespredatorypricingmore tempting. In future,ﬁrmscould increasinglydepend on toolsprovided bytheir big-gestrival. IfAmazon doesbecome a utilityforcommerce, thecallswill growforitto be regulated asone. Shareholders arerightto believe in Amazon’spotential. Butsuccesswill bring itinto conﬂictwith an even strongerbeast: government. 7Amazon’s empireThe world’s mostremarkable ﬁrm mayeventuallybe threatened byits own success Leaders8LeadersThe EconomistMarch25th2017ONMARCH 25th 1957, withthe shadowofthe secondworld warstill hangingoverthem, sixEuropean countriessigned the foundingtreatyof anewsortofinternational club.The European Union, asthe clubcame to be called, achieved suc-cesson a scale itsfounderscould barelyhave imagined, notonlyunderpinningpeace on the continentbutcreating a singlemarketaswell asa single currency, and bringinginto itsfold ex-dictatorshipsto the south and ex-communistcountries to theeast, asitexpanded from sixmembersto 28. Yeteven astoday’sEuropean leadersgatherin Rome thisweekend to celebrate the60th anniversary, theyknowtheirprojectisin bigtrouble. The threatsare both external and internal. Internally, theﬂawsthatbecame glaringlyevidentin the euro crisis have yetto be ﬁxed. Prolonged economicpain hascontributed to aplunge in supportforthe EU. Populist, anti-European partiesare attackingthe EU’sveryexistence—notleastin France,where Marine Le Pen isdoinguncomfortablywell in the presi-dential campaign, even ifthe National Frontleaderis unlikelyto win in May. The mostdramaticresultofthe anti-EUback-lash so farisBrexit. Britain’sprime minister, Theresa May, willnotbe in Rome forthe birthdayparty; on May29th she planstoinvoke Article 50 ofthe EUtreatyto startthe Brexitprocess. Ne-gotiationsoverBritain’sdeparture will consume much timeand energyforthe nexttwo years; losingsuch a bigmember isalso a huge blowto the club’sinﬂuence and credibility.The external pressuresare equallyserious. The refugee cri-sishasabated, butmainlythanksto a dodgydeal with Turkey.Anewlyaggressive Russia underVladimirPutin and, in Do-nald Trump, an American presidentwho isunenthusiasticaboutboth the EUand NATO, make thisa terrible time for Eu-rope to be weakand divided. Thata projectsetup to underpinEurope’spost-warsecurityshould falteratthe verymomentwhen thatsecurityisunderthreatisa bitterirony. Itisalso a re-minderofhowmuch isatstake ifEurope failsto ﬁx itself.Never-closerunionThe traditional response ofEU-enthusiaststo such challengesisto pressfora bold leap towardscloserunion. The euro needsthisifitisto succeed, theyargue. Equally, theysay, more pow-ersoughtto shiftto the centre to allowthe EU to strengthen itsexternal bordersand ensure thatitspeakswith one loud voiceto the likesofMrPutin and MrTrump. Yetthe evidence isthatneitherEuropean votersnortheirelected governments wantthis. Ifanything, publicopinion favoursthe reverse.Ifever-closerunion isnotpossible, anotherBrussels tradi-tion issimplyto muddle through. The euro crisisispast itsworst, immigration haspeaked and Brexitwill be managedsomehow. If, afterthisyear’selections, Emmanuel Macron isFrance’spresidentalongside eitherAngela Merkel orMartinSchulzasGermany’schancellor, the club would be understaunchlypro-EUleadership. Yetmuddlingalonghasrisks ofitsown. Arenewed ﬁnancial crisisthatupsetthe euro again, orthe election ofanothergovernmentcommitted to a referen-dum on EUoreuro membership, could tearthe union apart. Isthere a betteralternative? The answer, asourspecial re-portargues, isto pursue, more formallythan now, an EUthatisfarmore ﬂexible. In Euro-speak, thismeansembracing a“multi-tier” system, with the countriesofa much widerEu-rope takingpartto diﬀerentdegreesin itspolicies—and able tomove from one tierto anotherwith relative ease.The greatBritish break-oﬀThere hasrecentlybeen a ﬂurryofinterestin the notion ofa“multi-speed” Europe. ButwhatmostEUleadersmean bytheterm isthatcore membersshould be able to pursue commonpoliciesin areaslike defence, ﬁscal orwelfare policy; itimpliesthatall countriesare movingtowardsthe same destination. Abroader, “multi-tier” Europe would ﬁnd a place fornon-mem-bersaswell. The continentconsistsof48 countriesand 750mpeople, notjustthe 28countriesand 510mpeople in the union,still lessthe 19 and 340m in the euro.The core ofEurope will be those countriesthatshare thesingle currency. To solve the euro’sills, theyneed more integra-tion and shared institutions—from a properbankingunion to acommon debtinstrument. The nexttierwould comprise aloosergroup than nowofEUmembersthatare notreadyto ac-ceptthe sacriﬁce ofsovereigntyneeded to join the euro, whichsome will notdo formanyyears, and maynever.Beyond thata multi-tierEurope should accommodatewidelydiﬀeringcountries. Thatmeansa changed mindsetmore than changed treaties: in the language ofEurocrats, ac-ceptinga menuthatisà la carte, notprixﬁxe. Thisisanathemain Brussels, where the idea thatyoucan pickand choose thebitsofthe EUthatyoulike isfrowned upon, butitiswhat Euro-peansincreasinglywant. Countrieslike NorwayorSwitzer-land maywish to be closelybound to the European single mar-ket. Otherssuch asBritain maynotbe readyto accept the singlemarket’srules, butstill wish to trade asfreelyaspossible withthe EU. Theymightseeka biggerrole in otherareassuch asde-fence and security. And placeslike Turkey, the western Bal-kans, Ukraine and Georgia mightprefera similarassociatedstatusinstead oftoday’sunsatisfactorysituation, where theyare told theyare eligible to be full membersbutknow theywillneverbe allowed to join.To work, a multi-tierEurope should be pragmaticabout therulesthateach tierentails. Those in the outergroup mightnotacceptfullyfree movementofpeople, forinstance, but thatisno reason to wall oﬀtheiraccessto the EU’ssingle market. Norshould there be a stigma ofsecond-classstatusforthose out-side the core: afterall, theyinclude Denmarkand Sweden, twoofEurope’smostsuccessful countries. Waysshould be foundforcountrieswith militaryordiplomaticclout(eg, post-BrexitBritain) to join in foreign and defence policies.Forthe European projectto survive another60 years, thekeyisﬂexibility, in both directions. JustasBritain isleavingtheEU, anothercountrymightone dayleave the euro. Any suchstep will be hard to manage. Butifthe union cannotembracediﬀerentiation, itfacesthe riskofdisintegration instead.7The future of the European UnionHowto save EuropeIfitis to survive, the European Union mustbecome a lotmore ﬂexible 10LeadersThe EconomistMarch25th20171ALMOSTexactlya hundredyearsago, America waspoised to send troopsto Europeto ﬁghtin a warwhich was notin the country’snarrow, short-term self-interest.

Bankersknowwhattheircustomerseat, where theyshop and, increasingly, whattheygetup to online. Itis possi-ble forcustomersto share thesedata with others, butthe processiscumbersome. In eﬀect,banksenjoya monopolyoverdata thathashelped them getawaywith lousyservice and fend oﬀnewcomerswith betterideas. In Europe, atleast, thatisall aboutto change. The source ofthisupheaval isa newsetofregulations,snappilynamed the Second PaymentService Directive, or“PSD2” (see page 65). The rules, which are beingﬁnalised andwill be in force from Januarynextyear, will compel banks toshare data easilywith licensed third parties(ifthat iswhattheiraccount-holderswant). Bankersin Europe squeal thattheirproﬁtsand customerrelationshipsare underthreat. Fear-ingtheycould be next, America’sbankersare alreadylobbyingtheirregulatorsto keep theirdata monopolyintact. Such reac-tionsare predictable and wrong. Because that’s where the data areOpeningup banks, and the data theyhoard, isgood for con-sumersand competition.

The newrules, which also compel banksto share pay-mentinfrastructure with licensed third parties, should makeonline shoppingsimplerand cheaper, too. Some concernsaboutPSD2 are legitimate. In particular, itisreasonable to wonderaboutthe privacyand securityimplica-tionsofsensitive ﬁnancial data beingshared with third par-ties. Butbanksthemselvesare hardlyinvulnerable to cyber-attack. And the waythatEuropean regulatorspropose to dealwith these worrieslookspromising. Third partiesthatwantto use bankdata will need to con-vince national regulatorsthattheirdata defencesare solid andmustsubmitto annual inspections. Newbiesmustalso takeoutfraud insurance; theirinsurerswill have a clear reason todemand state-of-the-artcyber-security. Manyonline pay-mentswill become more secure than theyare today, becauseofthe directive’srequirementsforthe use ofa robustauthen-tication processinvolvingtwo-step veriﬁcation.The gap between writingrulesand implementingthem isalwayslarge, so a fewthingsare needed to make PSD2 a suc-cess. First, consentfrom customersto provide access to theirbankdata mustbe gained explicitly, notburied in pages ofgob-bledygook. The purposesforwhich data mightbe used shouldbe clearlyexplained; and individuals’ consentto share theirpersonal information should be easilyrevocable. Second, regulatorsmustbe ruthlessboth in ensuring thatbanksopen up theirinfrastructure to othersand in withdraw-ingthe licencesofthird partiesthatbreakthe rules, particularlyon cyber-security.

However, too many companies still struggle to generate value from the volumes of data they produce. Often, business units are without access to the information they need to fuel performance.Most executives understand the value of becoming a data-driven enterprise but don’t know how to translate this goal into action. According to NTT DATA Services CEO John  McCain, “The biggest IT challenges that companies face are modernizing their IT operations to compete in a glob-al economy and finding a trusted partner with the scale, breadth and depth of capabilities to support them for the long haul.”How IT supports business strategyWhen adopting an IT solution, companies must consider its impact on business strategy, risk, governance and se-curity. This formidable task requires a trusted partner with the right industry and market knowledge. Mr. McCain notes, “NTT DATA provides strategic yet practical and actionable guid-ance—with industry and technology solutions ranging from blueprint to delivery and beyond.” NTT DATA’s acquisition of Dell Services gives the company the full complement of ser-vices necessary to tackle any com-plex business challenge. Further, the diffuse nature of global companies means that IT solutions must be flex-ible enough to accommodate opera-tions across markets. This dynamic makes NTT DATA’s 240 data centers and professionals located in more than 50 countries criti-cal assets for global companies requiring a consistent ap-proach to IT management and local regulatory compliance. Meeting specific industry needsAn added obstacle is that effective IT solutions can vary considerably across industries. Financial institutions must meet higher reporting and regulatory compliance stan-dards. Healthcare providers and health plans are striving to be more customer-centric and exploring new risk-sharing models—all while protecting patient information. Manu-facturing’s tech transformation is accelerating rapidly, with increased automation and efforts to analyze volumes of data generated during design and production. Meanwhile, utilities are seeking to use sensor data to improve perfor-mance and decrease costs.IT solutions must be tailored to industry needs, anticipate change and speed adoption of the next wave of innova-tion, from artificial intelligence and machine learning to 3D manufacturing and robotic process automation. This combination of skills and experience is unique to NTT DATA. Mr. McCain says, “Our deep domain exper-tise, coupled with decades of indus-try know-how, ensures our clients can trust that we understand their  specific business and challenges  and can provide the strategic ad-vice and comprehensive solutions  to keep them a step ahead of the competition.”Turning business challenges  into opportunitiesDespite recent developments that have made data, analytics and tech-nology a more pressing concern, certain fundamentals remain. Mr. McCain puts it simply: “Investments in technology must move enterprises forward and achieve tangible results. That’s why NTT DATA is committed to using technology to turn business challenges into opportunities.”ADVERTISEMENTNTT DATA: Translating data into  insights and a competitive edgePART TWO IN A SERIESJohn W. McCainChief Executive Officer, NTT DATA Services“[One of] the biggest  IT challenges that  companies face...[is] finding a trusted part-ner with the scale, breadth and depth of capabilities to support them for the long haul.”At NTT DATA, we’re IT rock stars.

Operat-ingproﬁtshave expanded, too, butat$4.2bn remain relativelysmall—which ishowshareholderslike it. Amazon hasal-waysemphasised the value oflong-termgrowth (presumablywith some biggerpro-ﬁtsdown the line), and investorshavecome to acceptthis. In February, when Am-azon reported higherproﬁtsbutlower rev-enue than expected, itsshare price tempo-rarilydipped. Shareholdersworried itmightnotbe setto growasquicklyas theyhad hoped. Morgan Stanley, a bank, expectsAma-zon’ssalesto rise bya compound averageof16% each yearfrom 2016 through to 2025:thatishigherthan itsestimatesfor GoogleorFacebook. Thatisa slowerpace thanAmazon managed overthe pastdecade;butthe biggera companyis, the harder itisto keep growing. Amazon’sannual salesof$136bn are almost50% more those ofAl-phabet, Google’sparent, and overfourtimesFacebook’s. CreditSuisse, anotherbank, calculatesthatonlyten ﬁrmswithsalesofmore than $50bn have managed togrowbyan average of15% ormore fortenyearsstraightsince 1950; no companywithsalesofmore than $100bn hasdone so. IfAmazon were to pull itoﬀ, itwould be themostaggressive expansion ofa giantcom-panyin the historyofmodern business.Thatraisestwo questions.

Butthatlowersthe marginsfortheironline salesand riskscannibalis-ingsalesfrom theirstores. The competitionthusthreatensto make manyofthem per-manentlylessproﬁtable. LastyearWalmartmade a particularlyexpensive bid to fend oﬀAmazon, paying$3bn forJet.com, an e-commerce startup.MarcLore, Jet.com’sboss, hashistorywhen itcomesto competingwith Amazon.“The EverythingStore”, a bookaboutAma-zon byBrad Stone, a journalist, tells thestoryofQuidsi, a previousstartup of MrLore’sthatsold nappiesthrough a sitecalled Diapers.com. When Amazon wasbuildinga nappiesbusiness, the biggercompanycutpricesso rapidlythatQuidsireckoned thatmatchingthem would lose it$100m in three months. Quidsi agreed tobe boughtin 2010. Othercompetitorsare worried, too. InDecemberAmazon challenged NetﬂixbyexpandingPrime Videoto more than 200countries. “I feel like we’re competingwithan unusual person,” Reed Hastings, Net-ﬂix’sboss, hasadmitted. “Because Jeﬀ’sthere, it’skind ofscary.” Thisisnota win-ner-takes-all contest; two-thirdsofAmeri-can Prime subscribersalso subscribe toNetﬂix, accordingto Cowen, a ﬁnancial-servicesﬁrm. ButasPrime Video’soﬀeringimproves, some Netﬂixviewersmightdrop theirsubscription. Netﬂixhopesto keep them byspendingon itsexclusive shows; like Spotifyin mu-sic, italso hasthe advantage ofan estab-lished brand and a customerbase. Butcompetition ishottingup. Disney, Fox,NBCUniversal and Time Warnerhave beefedup a streamingcompetitoroftheirown,Hulu. The othertech giantshave theirownreasonsto be worried aboutAmazon—though theymayalso have the bestde-fences. Apple facesthe riskthatAmazon,notiTunes, becomesthe defaultplatformforstreamingand buyingcontent; but ithasthe diversiﬁed revenue needed to ﬁghtitscorner. Google, foritspart, does notwantshoppingthrough Amazon, and par-ticularlyAlexa, to cutitoutofthe loop,jeopardisingitsadvertisingrevenues; nordoesitwantAlexa to be the platform peo-ple chose forrunningtheirhomes. In Feb-ruaryGoogle said itsnewassistant—called,simply, Assistant—would notonlypower adevice called Google Home, butroll out tosmartphonesusingAndroid, itsmobile op-eratingsystem. Theirstrength in mobilephonesgivesboth Apple and Google anedge overAmazon.Tech giantswill also be ﬁghting Ama-zon in the cloud. Microsoftisitsstrongestcompetitor, butGoogle and IBMare formi-dable, too. All fourare ﬁghtingto lowerpricesand provide bettertechnology, withbillionsnowbeingpumped into AI. Ifcompetitorsfail to haltAmazon’swhirl ofactivities, antitrustenforcersmightyetdo so instead. Thisdoesnot seeman imminentthreat. American antitrustauthoritiesmainlyconsidera company’seﬀecton consumersand pricing, notbroadermarketpower. Bythatstandard,Amazon hasbroughtbigbeneﬁts. Two perilslurk, however. One, for now,istheoretical. In a recentarticle in the YaleLawJournal, Lina Kahn argued that,amongotherthings, the scope ofAma-zon’sactivitiesmaymake itimpossible forcompetitorsnotto end up relyingon it. Ifregulatorspaid more heed to marketpow-er, thatcould be a red ﬂag—especially asAmazon continuesto growand provide itsservicesto competitorsevermore widely.Asecond threatisreal. Donald Trump doesnotcare forthe Washington Post, a newspa-perMrBezosowns. In 2016 MrTrump saidMrBezoswasusingthe Postto attackhimbecause Amazon has“a huge antitrustpro-blem”. IfMrTrump believesthat—orevenifhe doesn’t—hisadministration mightfa-vouraction. Fornow, though, Amazon’srivalsmustfend forthemselves. Theycan hope Mr Be-zosmakesa mistake, orgetswrong-footedbysome startlingnewtrend—butthoughboth are possible, theyare hardlya strat-egy. Instead, the bestdefence issimple: sellsomethingthatcustomerswantand Ama-zon doesnothave. Exceptional merchan-dise and service helps. In America big,bland bookstoresare struggling, butthenumberofindependentbooksellershasclimbed. The threatfrom Amazon hasforced Walmartto improve itsstores, witheasiercheckoutand more helpful staﬀ; ithasseen a bump in sales. Amazon’sinvest-mentsin television have helped fuel a bid-dingwarforgood programming—Holly-wood’sstudiosare producingthe besttelevision forgenerations. And thanks toAWS, and itscompetitors, there hasneverbeen a bettertime to startup a web-basedordata-centricﬁrm. Fordecades, consumergiantsmostlygrewslowlyand comfortably, with onlyoccasional burstsofinnovation. NowAm-azon’sepicjourneyisforcingcompanies tolowerpricesand to improve productsor tosuﬀer.

She is amemberofthe Liberal DemocraticParty(LDP), which dominatesJapanese politics,and brieﬂyserved asministerofdefence adecade ago. Yetlastyearshe won her cur-rentjob byrunningasan independent,againstthe LDPcandidate. Lastmonth shethumped the LDPagain afterbackinga ri-val candidate formayorofone ofTokyo’s23 wards.

Farfrom pun-ishingthisopen rebellion, manyin thepartyseem to be relishingit.MsKoike’sbattering-ram in herwaragainstthe LDPisKibo no Juku(School ofHope), a private academyforherpoliticalacolytes. The school haswhittled downthousandsofapplicantsto a fewdozengraduateswho will stand againstLDPcan-didatesin July. The charismaticgovernor’snewparty, Tomin Firstno Kai(TokyoitesFirstGroup) could end up the biggest in theassembly: a recentpoll found that84% ofTokyoitessupporther.Thisrun hasbeen fuelled bya popu-list’sinstinctforpickingﬁghts. Ms Koike, aformernewscaster, hasblamed corruptionforthe spirallingcostofthe OlympicGames, which Tokyo will hostin 2020. Herwarningthatspendingon the eventcouldtop ¥3trn ($27bn), overfourtimesthe origi-nal estimate, hasalarmed voters. “Peoplesee heron television everynightﬁghtingforthem and theylike herforit,” saysKat-suei Hirasawa, an LDPpolitician.MsKoike’sshowdown with ShintaroIshihara, anotherLDPrebel who ran thecapital from 1999 to 2012, hasalso caughtthe public’simagination. MsKoike blamesMrIshihara forapprovingthe relocation ofTsukiji, the world’sbiggestﬁsh market, tothe toxicsite ofa disused gasworks. Thefrail ex-governorhasbeen summoned tothe cityassemblyin a potentiallyhumiliat-ingprobe thatcould widen to include hislinksto a failed bank. Duringthe election forgovernorlastsummer, MrIshihara said thatrunning To-kyo could notbe leftto “a woman with toomuch make-up”. Butcalculation, notre-venge, motivatesMsKoike, saysMichaelCucek, a political blogger. “Heraim istowipe outthe LDPold guard.” In thisshe isfollowingthe lead ofJunichiro Koizumi, Ja-pan’sprime ministerfrom 2001to 2006. MrKoizumi also cultivated youngcandidates,dubbed “assassins”, to supplantoppo-nentswithin the LDPblockinghisattemptto trim publicspendingand privatise Ja-pan’sgiantpostoﬃce. The injection offresh blood helped to reinvigorate thepartyand vindicate MrKoizumi.Buteven a convincingwin in Tokyowould notgive MsKoike the sortofpoliti-cal machine she would need to take on theLDPnationwide. Instead, she mayhope toparlayherinsurrection into a return to theheightsofthe party. In 2008 she stood forthe leadership, which would have broughtwith itthe job ofprime minister, but losttoTaro Aso.There are fewobviouscandidatestosucceed the currentprime minister, ShinzoAbe. MsKoike’slackofa clearideology isno handicap: the LDPitself, afterall, ﬂirtedwith austerityunderMrKoizumi butnowrunsone ofthe world’smostspendthriftgovernments. She hasbeen cultivating alli-ances. Komeito, the LDP’scoalition partneratthe national level, agreed earlier thismonth to supporthercandidatesin July.Several LDPpoliticianshave also ralliedbehind the governor, earningtheirexpul-sion from the party’sTokyo chapter.The governorherselfisprotected fromthe LDP’sretribution byherpopularity.Castingheroutwould onlymake the partylookscared and vindictive, saysRobert Fa-hey, a contributorto Sankei Shimbun, anewspaper. The party’sgrandeesare prob-ablywaitingto see howMsKoike’sproté-gésfare, saysMrHirasawa.

Pratap BhanuMehta, a columnistin the dailyIndian Ex-presswho rarelyusessuch bluntlanguage,describesthe Hindupriest-turned-politi-cian as“the single mostdivisive, abusive,polarisingﬁgure in UPpolitics”. No one can argue with the word “polar-ising”.

Time and again in UP, such talkhashelped turn ordinaryscuﬄesinto uglysectarian clashes.Earlierthismonth India’sprime minis-ter, Narendra Modi, celebrated hisparty’scrushingtriumph in UPstate electionswith a soothingspeech on the need to un-ite forthe common good. Yetshortlyafter-wards, he appointed MrAdityanath to runthe state. Some saythatMrModi’scalcula-tionsare political. Forthe ﬁrsthalf ofhisterm he pandered mostlyto better-oﬀ, bet-ter-educated cityfolk; the choice of a ﬁre-brand priestismeantto placate a diﬀerentand restlessdemographic, hisparty’sruralHindu-nationalistbase.

MrAdityanath hasalreadyshutdownslaughterhousesand butchershopssus-pected ofhandlingbeef, and hassetup an“anti-Romeo squad” to huntlove jihadistsand otherpredators. Butthe bestindica-tion ofhisintentionswill be Ayodhya. Hin-du-nationalist“moderates” have longcounselled patience regardingthe buildingofthe Ram temple; hardline groupssaytheywantitto happen now. Which ap-proach will MrAdityanath take? 7THE Chinese authoritiesare so angrywith South Korea thattheyhavecheered on boycottsofSouth Koreangoodsand culture, persecuted South Kore-an ﬁrmsoperatingin China and discour-aged Chinese touristsfrom visitingSouthKorea. China isSouth Korea’sbiggestmar-ketforexports(itspent$137bn on South Ko-rean goodsin 2015, nearlytwice asmuch asthe nextbiggesttaker, America), so theprospectofa prolonged dispute isalarm-ing. Itisalso puzzling, given thatthe sourceofthe row—the deploymentofan Ameri-can anti-missile system called THAAD (pic-tured)—doesnotseemnearlyasobjection-able asChina suggests. Earlierthismonth America began in-stallinga THAADsystem in South Korea.Asifto conﬁrm the rationale fordeploy-ment, the previousdayNorth Korea hadﬁred fourmissilesinto the Sea ofJapan, inwhatappeared to be a simulated attack onan American base. LastyearNorth Koreaconducted more than 20 ballistic-missiletestsin deﬁance ofUNSecurityCouncilresolutions. Ifanything, the tempo of mis-sile launcheshasincreased thisyear. Thisweeksawthe testingofa powerful newrocketengine and an abortive missilelaunch. YetChina’sforeign ministryhaslongfulminated againstTHAAD. Itgreetedthe deploymentbydeclaringits“ﬁrm op-position and strongdissatisfaction”.In Seoul lastweekAmerica’ssecretaryofstate, RexTillerson, called on the SouthKorean governmentto stand ﬁrm in its sup-portforTHAADand described China’sbe-haviouras“inappropriate and troubling”.Moon Jae-in, the front-runnerin South Ko-rea’spresidential election, which will beheld on May9th, hassaid he will reviewthe deployment, buthasbeen careful notto promise to reverse it.China hasexpressed two related criti-cismsofTHAAD, which standsforTermi-nal High Altitude Area Defence. The ﬁrst isthatthe powerful radarthatTHAADusesto trackand hittargetshasthe capability of“seeing” farinto China and thuscould beused to undermine the eﬀectivenessofChina’sown nucleararsenal. The secondisthatthe system, which isdesigned to in-terceptand destroyshort- and intermedi-ate-range ballisticmissilesduringtheir de-scent(terminal) phase, ataltitudesof40-150km, would notbe eﬀective becauseSeoul isso close to North Korean missilelaunchers. The implication, again, is thatChina isthe real target.Neitherofthese argumentsisconvinc-ing. In the ﬁrstplace, there are already twoTHAADradarsin Japan, which can see intoChina, albeitnotquite asfarasthe radargoinginto South Korea. Michael Elleman, amissile-defence expertatthe InternationalInstitute forStrategicStudies, says thattheTHAADradarin South Korea mightpick upChinese missilesbound forthe WestCoast THAAD in South KoreaHere’s lookingatyouWhyan American anti-missile system does notmeritChina’s fury24AsiaThe EconomistMarch25th20172ofAmerica in theirboostphase, butthe ad-vantage itwould give would be “quite mar-ginal”. THAADinterceptorsin South Koreacannotbe used to hitChinese missiles intheirlaunch orboostphase and are in thewrongplace to hitmissilesattacking Amer-ica in theirterminal phase.Moreover, the radarin South Korea willbe conﬁgured in “terminal” ratherthan“look” mode. Ittakesa software changeand aboutﬁve hoursto switch modes, butdoingso would renderTHAADuselessagainstNorth Korean missiles, which poseagrave and immediate threatto the 28,500American troopsin South Korea.America saysithasrepeatedlyoﬀeredChinese oﬃcialstechnical brieﬁngs on theradar’scapabilitiesand limitations. Theyhave shown little interest, possiblybe-cause theydo notreallydisagree about thethreatTHAADrepresents. Chinese mili-taryanalystshave boasted ofChina’sabili-tyto “blind” THAAD (meaningto incapaci-tate itthrough electronicinterference)—afurtherindication thatthe outrage is politi-callymotivated. Itisalso wrongto suggestthatTHAADdoesnothingto protectSouth Korea fromthe North. In a paperfor38 North, a web-site, MrElleman and Michael Zagurekcal-culate thatfaced with 50-missile salvoes, alayered defence consistingofSouth Ko-rea’sPatriotsystem and two THAADbat-teries(anothermaybe deployed when it isavailable) would probablydestroy90% ofincomingland-based missiles. The threatthatone ofthe 10% gettingthrough mightbe carryinga nuclearwarhead would notbe eliminated. ButSouth Korea isa lot saferwith THAADthan withoutit. Itispossible thatChina reallydoes fearthatone dayitsland-based nuclearforcesmightbe hemmed in byan integratedAmerican missile-defence system stretch-ingfrom Japan to India. Thatisa remoteprospectatboth the political and the tech-nical level but, byopposingTHAAD’sde-ploymentin South Korea, China maybehopingto nip such a possibilityin the bud. Itismore likely, however, thatChina, al-waysresentful ofthe presence ofAmeri-can troopsso nearitsborders, seesan op-portunityto useTHAADto weakenAmerica’salliance with South Korea.Itmayhope thatitsbullyingmightyetpres-sure South Korea’snextpresidentinto re-versingthe deployment. Ifthatisthe inten-tion, however, ithasprobablyoverplayeditshand, raisingKorean hackleswith itsblatantlycoercive methods. Donald Trump isaboutto have his ﬁrstmeetingwith China’spresident, Xi Jinping.There will be plentyofthornyissues to dis-cuss. Butwhen itcomesto THAAD, the un-predictable MrTrump can delivera reason-able message: the problem isnotmissiledefence, butthe belligerence ofNorth Ko-rea which makesitnecessary, and whichMrXi hasdone too little to restrain. 7Hydrological jurisprudenceTryme a riverITSOUNDS, admitsChrisFinlayson, likea“prettynutty” idea. Yetthe newlawthatdeclaresthe Whanganui river, NewZealand’sthird-longest, a legal person, inthe sense thatitcan own property, incurdebtsand petition the courts, isnot un-precedented. Te Urewera, an area offorested hillsin the north-eastthat usedto be a national park, became a personforlegal purposesin 2014. And aroundthe world companies, foundationsandassorted unitsofgovernmenthave legalrightsand responsibilitiesindependentofthe people who staﬀthem. All thesame, NewZealandershave been jokingaboutwhetherthe Whanganui mightnowvote, buya fewbeers(howold is it?)orbe charged with murderifa swimmerdrowns. The law, which wasapproved onMarch 15th, stemsfrom disputesovertheTreatyofWaitangi, bywhich NewZea-land’sindigenousMaori ceded sover-eigntyto British colonialistsin 1840. Thetreatywassupposed to have protectedMaori rightsand property; itwasob-served mainlyin the breach. In recentyearsthe governmenthastried to negoti-ate settlementsforbreachesofthe treatywith diﬀerentMaori iwi, ortribes. For theWhanganui iwi, the idea ofthe river asaperson isnothingnew. The iwi professesadeep spiritual connection to the Whan-ganui: asa local proverb hasit, “I am theriverand the riverisme.” The lawac-knowledgesthe riverasa “livingwhole”,ratherthan tryingto carve itup, putting torestan ownership dispute thathasdragged on for140 years. When itwaspassed, membersofthe iwiin the galleryofparliamentbroke into a ten-minutesongofcelebration.In practice, two guardianswill act forthe river, one appointed bythe govern-mentand one bythe iwi. MrFinlayson,the ministerin charge ofnegotiations tiedto the TreatyofWaitangi, hopesthechange will help bringthose who doenvironmental damage to the rivertobook. Underthe settlementthe govern-mentwill also paythe iwiNZ$80m($56m) ascompensation forpastabusesand setup a fund ofNZ$30m to enhancethe “health and well-being” ofthe river. Itisone of82 dealsthataim to remedybreachesofthe treaty, includingone withthe Tuhoe iwithatmade Te Urewera intoaperson.Daysafterthe lawpassed, an Indiancourtdeclared two ofthe biggestandmostsacred riversin India, the Gangesand Yamuna, to be people too.Makingexplicitreference to the Whanganuisettlement, the courtassigned legal “par-ents” to protectand conserve theirwa-ters. Local lawyersthinkthe ruling mighthelp ﬁghtsevere pollution: the rivers’defenderswill no longerhave to provethatdischargesinto them harm anyone,since anysullyingofthe waterswill nowbe a crime againstthe riveritself. There isno doubtthatofthe 1.3bn-odd people inIndia, the Gangesand the Yamuna areamongthe mostdowntrodden.Awatercourse in NewZealand becomes a personThree people and a boatThe EconomistMarch25th2017 Asia25ONApastvisitto the little ﬁshingportofTanmen, on the is-land-province ofHainan in southern China, pigswere beingdriven onto the foredecksofwooden trawlers, while water buttswere beinglashed down atthe stern. Fartherdown the quay, sim-ilarboatswere aboutto unload theircatch aftera month atsea:notﬁsh butgiantclams, Tridacna gigas, up to a metre across,which required two oreven fourmen to carry.

Butthe clam boatshave gone, and some ofthe piratical air too. Thequayhashad a makeover, with newawningsunderwhich ﬁsh-ermen’swivesgrill squid forday-trippingtourists. “It’sover,” oneofthe women declared. “The authoritieshave banned the clamﬁshing. It’sbigﬁnesand 15 yearsin jail iftheycome afteryou.”The ban issurelywelcome. From an analysisofsatellite imag-ery, John McManusofthe UniversityofMiami lastyearconclud-ed that40 square miles(104 square km) ofsome ofthe mostbio-diverse coral reefson Earth have been destroyed in the SouthChina Sea thanksto giant-clam poachers. In the shallow watersofthe reefs, crewsuse the propellersofsmall boatslaunchedfrom each mother-ship to smash the surroundingcoral and thusfree the clamsanchored fastto the reef. Though the practice hasreceived little attention, itisecological hooliganism, and mostofithasbeen perpetrated byboatsfrom Tanmen.The ﬁshermen have notbeen the reefs’ onlyadversaries. Chi-na’shuge and (to itsneighbours) controversial programme sincelate 2013 ofbuildingartiﬁcial islandsaround disputed rocks andreefsin the South China Sea haspaved overanother22 squaremilesofcoral. When the two activitiesare taken together, MrMcManussays, about10% ofthe reefsin the vastSpratlyarchipel-ago to the south ofHainan, and 8% ofthose in the Paracel islands,between Hainan and Vietnam, have been destroyed. Given thatAsia’sCoral Triangle, ofwhich the South China Sea forms theapex, isa single, interconnected ecosystem, the repercussions ofthese activities, environmentalistssay, will be huge.Yetthe Chinese authorities’ conversion to environmentalismisnotabsolute. Afewstreetsbackfrom the waterfront in Tanmen,elegantboutiquessell jewelleryand curiosfashioned from thegiantclams—and clam shellsare still stacked outside. And the pro-vincial moneythatisso clearlybeinglavished on Tanmen sitsoddlywith the illegalityofitstownsfolk’swayoflife. Tanmenused to be isolated on the farside ofa wide river. Now a bridgeconnectsitto the posh resortdistrictofBoao, famous fora forum,akind ofAsian Davos, which China’sleadersgrandlyhosteachyear. Moststrikingofall, in 2013 PresidentXi Jinpinghimselfshowed up in Tanmen. Boardingone ofthe trawlershe declaredto the crew, accordingto state media, “Youguysdo a greatjob!”The media did notreportthata yearearlierthe trawler in ques-tion had been caughtin the territorial watersofPalau, and in theconfrontation with local police thatfollowed one ofthe crewmembershad been shotdead. In Chinese propaganda, Tanmen’sﬁshermen are patriotsand model workers. So whatisgoingon? Overthe yearsTanmen’sﬁshermen havebecome partofChina’spowerprojection in the South China Sea,an unoﬃcial butvital adjunctto the Chinese navyand coast-guard.

Theyare factson the water, and have been involved in China’sgrowingaggression in the South China Sea. In 2012 boatsfromTanmen were partofa navy-led operation to wrestcontrol ofScarborough Shoal from the Philippines, chasingPhilippine ﬁsh-ingvesselsaway. In 2014 theyescorted a Chinese oil rigthat wasbeingtowed provocativelyinto Vietnamese waters. On land,Vietnamese expressed theirrage byransackingfactories theythoughtwere Chinese-owned. Atsea, boatsfrom Tanmenrammed and sankone ofthe ricketyVietnamese vesselscomingoutto protest.

Raise the red lanternsAccordingto MrNye, whom Chinese oﬃ-cialsacknowledge asa guruon the topic,there are three main waysthata countrycan gain softpower: through itspoliticalvalues, itsculture and itsforeign policies.Butwinningon all frontsisnoteasy.

MrShambaugh reck-onsthatAmerica spentlessthan $670m onits“publicdiplomacy” in 2014. The partyborrowed the idea ofsoftpowerfrom an American academic, Jo-seph Nye, who coined the term in 1990. MrNye argued thathard poweralone wasnotenough to wield inﬂuence in the world. Ithad to come from “the softpowerofattrac-tion”, too. China wasacutelyconsciousthatitlacked it.

The culture thatthepartyhaschosen forforeign consumptionismainlyone thatwasformed longbeforecommunism. Confucius, condemned byMao asa peddleroffeudal thought, is nowbeingproﬀered asa sage with a message ofharmony. Since 2004 China hasestab-lished some 500 government-funded“ConfuciusInstitutes” in 140 countries.These oﬀerlanguage classes, hostdancetroupesand teach Chinese cooking. Manyofthem are on campuses(an activityin-volvingone, atthe UniversityofDelaware,ispictured). China hasalso setup morethan 1,000 “ConfuciusClassroom” ar-rangementswith foreign schools, provid-ingthem with teachers, materialsandfundingto help children learn Mandarin.

MrXi speaksofa “newtype ofgreat-powerrelations”, suggestingthatChina can co-existwith America with-outthe kind ofrivalrythatcaused the twoworld wars. His“One Belt, One Road”scheme—involvingChinese investmentininfrastructure acrossAsia, the Middle East,Africa and Europe—aimsto reinforce Chi-na’simage asa countryeagerto use itsnewfound wealth forthe good oftheworld (see page 61). To help craftsuch an image, China hasbeen investingmassivelyin itsforeign-lan-guage media. Xinhua, the government’smain newsagency, opened nearly40 newforeign bureausbetween 2009 and 2011,bringingitstotal to 162—ata time whencash-strapped media organisationselse-where were shuttingthem down (ithopesto have 200 by2020). The numberofXin-hua correspondentsbased overseasdou-bled duringthattime. In Decemberthestate broadcasterrebranded itsinterna-tional media service, callingitChina Glo-bal Television Network. Itssixchannelsaim to compete with global servicessuchasthe BBC, CNN and Al Jazeera. (MrXiurged the networkto “tell the China storywell, spread China’svoice” and “showcaseChina’srole asa builderofworld peace”.)China Daily, the government’smain Eng-lish-language mouthpiece, paysforinsertsin newspaperssuch asthe Washington Postand the Wall StreetJournal.The governmentistryingto extend itsreach online, too. Lastyeara government-aﬃliated media group spent30m yuan($4.35m) to launch a free, English-languagewebsite called Sixth Tone. Ittriesto sellChina’smessage bybeingmore sassy, andsometimesmore critical, than otherstatemedia. With the party’sblessing, privatecompaniesare gettinginvolved, too. In2015 Alibaba, China’sbiggeste-commerceﬁrm, paid $260m forthe South ChinaMorningPost, HongKong’sﬂagship Eng-lish-language newspaperwhich hasinci-sive—and often critical—reportingon Chi-nese politics. The deal hasraised fears thatAlibaba will tryto turn the newspaper intoacheerleaderforthe party.

China wantsitsmessage to be clearlyvisible in the heartland ofAmerica’scapi-talistculture. Itbegan advertisingitself inTimesSquare in 2011(see picture, previouspage).

Reuterssaid the stationsavoid-ed airinganythingthatmightportray Chi-na in a negative light.Sweetand sourButwhen MrNye wrote aboutsoftpower,he suggested thatgovernmentscould notmanufacture it. He argued thatmuch ofAmerica’shad sprungfrom itscivil society:“everythingfrom universitiesand founda-tionsto Hollywood and pop culture”. Thepartyisdistrustful ofcivil society; itssoft-powerbuildinghasbeen almostentirelystate-led. China hastried to combine ele-mentsofsoftpowerwith the hard powerofitsilliberal politics. Farfrom enhancingChina’sglobal image, thisapproach has of-ten served to undermine it. Take the ConfuciusInstitutesand Class-rooms. In 2007 a seniorpartyleaderde-scribed these as“an importantpartofChi-na’soverseaspropaganda set-up.” Butmanycash-strapped universitieshavegratefullysupplanted theirown languagecourseswith onesled (even funded) byConfuciusInstitutes.

AsforChina’smessage ofpeace to oth-ercountries, manyin Asia are farfrom con-vinced. Itsgrabsforterritoryin the EastandSouth China Seashave fuelled widespreadresentment. The rapid expansion ofitsnavyand airforce, and itsbuild-up of mis-siles, have sown anxietyin America, too. China’ssoft-powerpush hasmadesome gains. In global opinion pollsrespon-dentsfrom Africa tend to be more positiveaboutChina than people from otherre-gions. Thatispartlybecause ofthe moneyChina haspoured into the continent—inAngola everyprofessional football matchisstaged in one offour, Chinese-built, sta-diums. Youngerpeople everywhere oftenviewChina more favourablythan olderpeople (see chart, left). Thisisa sign, per-haps, thatthe countryiscapable ofbeingcool—who doesnotgeta buzzoutofShanghai’sskyline? Portland Communica-tions, a public-relationsﬁrm, hasconduct-ed surveysofpublicattitudestowards 30countries—mostofthem, apartfrom Chi-na, rich ones. China ranked bottom in 2015.Lastyearitcrepttwo placeshigher, abovethe Czech Republicand Argentina. ButmoneyhasnotboughtChina any-thinglike the love itwould like. Ayear be-fore MrXi tookover, justoverhalfof Amer-icanshad positive impressionsofChina,accordingto the PewResearch Centre. Bythe end of2016 thatshare had fallen to 38%(see chart, bottom right). Pewfound a simi-lartrend in othercountries. In 14 outof19nationsitpolled between 2011and 2013,viewsofChina became lessfriendly. No thanks to the partyChina’srapid economicdevelopmenthaswon itmanyadmirers. Butthe social andenvironmental costsofthishave also pro-duced manycritics. Acountrycan havesoftpowerand smogaswell (America hashad plentyofboth in much ofitsrecent his-tory). ButChina’sairpollution under-minesitssoftpower: itiswidelyseen asev-idence ofa callousgovernmentthatcaresmore aboutmakingthe countryricherthan the health ofitspeople orthe planet.Manyforeignersnowassociate the coun-trywith smog—an importantreason why37% fewerinternational touristsvisitedChina in 2015 than in 2007. (Otherreasonsforthe drop included the costand increas-inghassle involved in obtainingvisas, andthe yuan’sexchange rate.) MrXi’seager-nessto join the ﬁghtagainstglobal warm-ingispartlydriven bya desire to regain thesoftpowerChina haslostowingto its envi-ronmental horrors. Some people in China privatelygrum-ble thatthe partyitself, with itsintoleranceofdissent, isthe biggestobstacle to thecountry’ssoft-powerdevelopment. Sincetakingoﬃce, MrXi’srelentlesseﬀortstoclamp down on civil societyhave hardlyhelped. He hasalso been tryingtostrengthen the party’scontrol overthe arts:in 2014 he said theyshould promote social-ism ratherthan be “slavesto the market”.Thatisunlikelyto help China emulate thesuccessofAmerica’stelevision shows,which projectan attractive vision of Amer-ican culture into people’slivingroomstheworld over. Fewpeople outside China wanttowatch itsprogrammes, which are oftenthinlydisguised propaganda. The successofChina’smostsuccessful ﬁlm globally,“CrouchingTiger, Hidden Dragon”, a co-production involvingAmerican compa-nies, hasnotbeen repeated since its releasein 2000. “KungFuPanda”, an American-made animated ﬁlm series, hasperhapsdone more to boostChina’ssoftpowerthan anymovie made bythe countryitself.Small wonderthatChina waskeen to en-terinto a co-production forthe third in theseries, which came outlastyear.State-controlled media in China havereported with relish on commentaryinAmerica suggestingthatDonald Trump’spresidencymaydeal a heavyblowto theUnited States’ softpower. Ifthatarisesfrom the appeal ofa country’sculture, po-litical idealsand foreign policies, as MrNyereckons, then America’ssoftpoweristhreatened in two ofthese domains. Chi-na’spolitical system maynotexertmuchofa global pull, butitcould begin to lookabitmore attractive to some people whencompared with America’s. China hassome attributesthatit canplayto itsadvantage. Forexample, it hasnocolonial historybeyond itscurrentbordersand hasstarted no warsin nearly40 years.In a turbulentworld, China’sleadershipappearsrelativelystable and predictable(atleastto the casual observer—MrXi’sde-termination to crush dissentsuggests heseesseriousthreatsto hispower). When MrXi became the ﬁrstChinesepresidentto addressthe global elite atDa-vos, onlydaysbefore MrTrump wasinau-gurated, he appeared to sense an opportu-nityto baskin a rare glow. Butthe upswingin China’ssoftpowerislikelyto be limited.Chinese oﬃcialsthemselvesquietlyaskwhetherChina’sstrategycan eversucceed.In 2015 a senioroﬃcial, ZhouHong, won-dered aloud whatstate-sponsored softpowercould achieve. “Withoutthe broadparticipation ofthe people,” he wrote inthe party’smain mouthpiece, the People’sDaily, “the external propagation ofculturenotonlylosesitsmeaning, butalso loses itsintrinsicenergy.” MrZhouwasrightaboutthe Chinese people’srole.

Though MrTrumppromoteshisnominee asdrawn from themould ofAntonin Scalia, the conservativejuristMrGorsuch wastapped to replace,he representsa starkdeparture from a cen-tral feature ofMrScalia’sjurisprudence.MrScalia sawthe constitution as “apractical and pragmaticcharterofgovern-ment” thatneitherrequiresnorpermits“philosophising”. In a right-to-die case in1990, he quipped thatthe nine justiceswere no bettersuited to make ﬁne distinc-tionson the moralityoflife support than“nine people picked atrandom from theKansasCitytelephone directory”. Bycon-trast, MrGorsuch seemsmore readyto lethisphilosophical judgmentsout. Tappinginto a tradition thatreachesbackto Thom-asAquinasand Aristotle, natural law saysthatsome thingsare objectivelygood inEuthanasia”, written in 2006, MrGorsuchpresented the ethicsofend-of-life ques-tionsasfundamental to hissense ofhowthe courtsshould handle lawsuitsarisingoutofthem. Though he hassaid thatjudgesmust“strive…to applythe lawasitis”, notastheywould like itto be, Mr Gor-such’snatural-lawlensisvisible too. Theﬁrstsign ofa linkbetween MrGorsuch’s“inviolability-of-human-life” viewand hisjurisprudence comesin hisbook’sninthchapter, where he tracesthe rootsof theidea thatthere isa moral imperative to re-spect“basicgoods”. The idea isapparent“from life’sexperiences” in which peopledeserve honour“outofrespectfortheir in-nate value”, MrGorsuch wrote. Treatinghuman life asinviolable isthe premise of“ourentire political system” and both theDeclaration ofIndependence and consti-tution reﬂectthe founders’ beliefin “self-evidenthuman rightsand truths”.Next, MrGorsuch surveyed rival per-spectiveson the sanctityoflife and hefound them all wanting: “[A]nyattempttodrawlinesbetween diﬀerentsortsof lives…seemsalmostinevitablyto become…anarbitraryand subjective enterprise.” Evenasmall degree ofarbitrariness“issimplynotacceptable” in “policydecisions” in-volving“who isand isnottreated asfullyhuman”. MrGorsuch concluded thatwhen judgesreviewlawspermittingter-minallyill people to enlistthe help ofdoc-torsin theirdeaths, theyshould keep inmind thatsuch acts“are categoricallywrong”. MrGorsuch discussed one example—the Oregon Death With DignityAct—andsuggested, contraryto the Supreme Court’sapproach, thatjudgesshould subjectsuchlawsto heightened scrutinybecause theymaythreaten the rightto life ofterminally themselvesand should therefore serve aslodestarsforindividualsand societies.John Finnis, MrGorsuch’sdissertation ad-viseratOxford and one ofthe world’sfore-mostnatural-lawtheorists, liststhesegoodsasknowledge, aestheticapprecia-tion, play, friendship, practical reasonable-ness, religion and—mostnotably—life. In the second dayofhishearings onMarch 21st, MrGorsuch deﬂected inquiriesinto hisold adviser’spositionson issueslike abortion and gayrights. “I’m nothereto answerfor…ProfessorFinnis,” he said.“I’d askyourespectfullyto lookatmy cre-dentialsand myrecord.” Such a lookisre-vealing. In hisdoctoral workand book, MrGorsuch drewon the idea that“human lifeisfundamentallyand inherentlyvaluable”to argue againstassisted suicide and eutha-nasia. When he ﬁrstappeared before theSenate in 2006, he pledged he would keephisphilosophical positionsoutofhis judg-ments. “[P]ersonal views…have nothingto do with the case before me in anycase”,he told SenatorLindseyGraham. The par-ties“deserve betterthan that”, he added,and “the lawdemandsmore than that.” MrGorsuch then emphasised thathiswrit-ings“have been largelyin defence ofexist-inglaw” and are “consistentwith the Su-preme Court’sdecisionsin thisarea andexistinglawin mostplaces.”In “The Future ofAssisted Suicide andThe Supreme CourtNeil Gorsuch: the naturalNEW YORKThe nominee is a verydiﬀerentkind ofconservative from the man he wouldreplace on the courtUnited StatesAlso in this section30G-man v POTUS30Sedentary millennials32The spread of cryotherapy33New York’s homelessness33Justice in Louisiana35Lexington: Denver’s mayor30UnitedStatesThe EconomistMarch25th201712ill individuals. ThissuggeststhatMr Gor-such’sphilosophical opposition to assistedsuicide—nowatoddswith the lawin sixstates(California, Colorado, Montana,Oregon, Vermontand Washington)—would in factinﬂuence hisjudgmentifthese policiesevercame before him. It alsohintsthatMrGorsuch mightbe sceptical oflawsallowingabortion and could—in linewith MrTrump’soft-repeated wish—recon-siderRoe vWade, the nearly45-year-oldprecedentprotectingwomen’sreproduc-tive choice. Judicial adventuresin metaphysicswere anathema to the man who spentthree decadesin the seatto which Mr Gor-such aspires. Throughouthiscareer, Scaliaamplycriticised liberal justiceswho sawthe constitution asa “living” documentan-imated byprinciplessuch asautonomy orhuman dignity. (He likened the justiﬁca-tion forAnthonyKennedy’ssame-sexmar-riage opinion in 2015 to “the mystical apho-rismsofthe fortune cookie”.) Scalia wouldbe ill atease with MrGorsuch’snatural-lawjurisprudence aswell, even ifits impli-cationsmore closelymatch hisconserva-tive views. Given the slim Republican majority inthe Senate, the conﬁrmation ofMrTrump’sﬁrstSupreme Courtpickisall butassured.The Senate’sapparentlackofinterest in MrGorsuch’sscholarship meansAmerica islikelyto soon have a natural lawyeras itsninth justice—with little sense ofwhat thatwould entail.7A“BIGgreycloud” hangsoverPresidentDonald Trump and hisadministration,followingpublicconﬁrmation bythe headofthe FBIthathisagentsare investigatingRussian governmenteﬀortsto interfere inthe presidential election, and whetherthose eﬀortswere co-ordinated with any-one linked to the Trump campaign.

Itisthe sortof smalltown in which the same surnames, manyofthem Cajun, recuramongprominentbusiness-ownersand oﬃceholders. It wasalso, until recently, home to a fearsomegang, known asthe Gremlins—atleast, sosaythe local prosecutors. Thatviewof thegroup hasyetto be endorsed bya trial, and,on currentform, itseemsunlikelyto be.The Gremlins, and the limbo in which theyare sunk, epitomise deep problemsin thecriminal-justice system ofLouisiana, andnotonlyLouisiana. Atﬁrsttheyinstead seemed proof ofthevirtuesofall-action policing. In February2016, ClayHiggins, then spokesman for thesheriﬀofnearbyStLandryParish, de-nounced them in a Crime Stoppersvideoas“animals” and “heathens”. Sportingbodyarmourand a riﬂe, and backed by aphalanxofoﬃcers, he told the Gremlinstheywould “be hunted”, railingin particu-laragainstone “uneducated 125-poundpunk” whom he vowed to meet“anytime,anywhere…Youwon’twalkaway.” Suchultimatumsearned MrHigginsthe nick-name, “the Cajun John Wayne”. Bythen, and before the indictment wasannounced the previousDecember, mostofthe 17 supposed Gremlinswere in custo-dy.

Even-tuallytheywore down CityHall, whichbacked down a bitfrom a total conversion.Only30 homelessmen are housed in thehotel now. All ofthem have jobs. This isnotunusual: more than one in ten ofNewYork’shomelesspeople are employed.Since 1979, when a homelessveteran ofthe Korean warsuccessfullysued the cityforfailingto provide him with shelter, thecityhashad a legal dutyto house those un-able to aﬀord a home. (NewYork’sstateconstitution saysthat“the aid, care andsupportofthe needyare publicconcernsand shall be provided bythe state and bysuch ofitssubdivisions.”) In recentyearsthe numberofhomelesspeople hasgrown. Whereasrentsincreased by18% be-tween 2005 and 2015, incomesrose by5%.When RudyGiuliani entered CityHall in1994, 24,000 people lived in shelters.About31,000 lived in them when MikeBloombergbecame mayorin 2002. WhenBill de Blasio entered CityHall in 2014,51,500 did. The numberofhomelesspeo-ple nowin sheltersisaround 63,000.Thatismore than atanytime since theGreatDepression, though the comparisonismisleadingbecause the deﬁnition ofhomelessnesshaschanged. These ﬁguresdo notinclude the numberslivingroughon the streets, who are hard to count accu-rately. Partlybecause ofthe obligation toprovide shelter, NewYorkin facthas fewerrough sleepersthan manysmallercities(3,000 isthe bestestimate) butmanymorehomelesspeople. LosAngelescomesnext,with 44,000 homeless, followed bySeattle(10,700), San Diego (8,700), Washington,DC(8,350) and San Francisco (7,000). Mrde Blasio unveiled a plan called“Turningthe Tide on Homelessness” attheend ofFebruary, and declared hisintentionto open 90 newhomelesssheltersthroughoutthe city. He plansto end the useofhotelsassheltersby2023 and to stop us-ingclustersites, private apartments paidforbythe city, by2021. Clusterapartmentsare notcheap and are often in poorcondi-tion.

Theywere also accused ofcolluding ina“criminal streetgang” and “racketeeringenterprise”—which iswhere the trouble,and the lessons, begin. AsRonal Serpas,formerlypolice chiefofNewOrleans, says,racketeeringlawsare meantto target big-time maﬁosi. Here, saysG. Paul Marx, chiefpublicdefenderforthe districtthat in-cludesAbbeville, “They’re all dirtpoor.” Moreover, he says, there isno evidenceofthe co-ordination orleadership thatsuch an enterprise requires. Manyofthe al-leged gangsters—all butone ofwhom areblack—were barelyborn when the racke-teeringissaid to have begun, in 1997. Theirsupportersinsistthe Gremlinstagreferrednotto a streetgangbutto a rap group, someofwhose membersposted ill-advised vid-eoson YouTube thatfeature inﬂammatorylyrics. “They’re no saints,” saysCorettaWilliams, whose son, Gene WilliamsIII, isamongthem, “butthey’re notthe sinnersthey’re claimingthem to be.” Those who builtthe case are nowreluc-tantto discussit. TonyHardy, Abbeville’spolice chief, pulled outofan interviewwith The Economist; although mostoftheaccused come from histown—from aneighbourhood where lawnsand prettyporchesgive wayto trailerhomesand ram-shackle yards—a sergeantsaid Louisiana’sstate police had prime responsibility. Thestate police, the head ofwhich recently re-tired amid a scandal overa tax-funded jol-lyto LasVegas, say“multiple agencies”tookpart. RogerHamilton, the prosecutor,declined repeated interviewrequests; cor-nered in Abbeville’swhite-columnedcourthouse, hisbossKeith Stutes, the dis-trictattorney, maintained thatwhile theracketeeringchargesmay“seem unjust” tothose aﬀected, they“ﬁtthe circumstances”. He and otherscited the ongoinglegalproceedingsin refusingto saymore. Thatseemsplausible, yetthe reticence contrastsstrikinglywith the hoopla overthe arrestsand indictments. Itwasn’tonlyMrHiggins.“Thisgroup ofindividualshave plaguedthe cityofAbbeville,” ChiefHardysaidthen. Grandstandingisa common featureofgangprosecutions, saysAlexAlonso ofCalifornia State University, LongBeach.The beneﬁtsto police and prosecutors gobeyond PR, he says. The ganglabel helps topersuade jurieswhen evidence isweak,and carriesextra jail time—perhaps, for the“Gremlins”, an extra 40 years. Police de-partmentscan applyforfederal gang-relat-ed grants; some in Abbeville thinkthat wasan incentive in thiscase.MrMarx, the publicdefender, istryingto have the racketeeringchargesquashed.Butotherwise he hasmade onlyone argu-ment: thatthose defendantsdeemed indi-gent, and so notionallyrepresented by hisoﬃce, have been denied due processoflaw. Because, although some have beenlocked up forovera year, he sayshis teamisable to help them in onlya limited, cur-soryway. Theyare thusbeingdenied arightthatthe constitution supposedlyguarantees—asare hundredsofothersinLouisiana and acrossAmerica.Throwawaythe keyGiven the riskofconﬂicts, each “Gremlin”requireshisown counsel. Three have priv-ate lawyers; the trouble forthe others isthatMrMarxdoesnothave the manpowerto serve them. Theyare notalone. As ofthebeginningofMarch hisoﬃce, which cov-ersthree southern Louisiana parishes,counted 746 individualswho had beencharged butlacked representation—a bigbacklogbutonlya third ofthe total atthestartoflastyear. Thatwaswhen the chron-icfundingproblemsofLouisiana’spublicdefendersbecame a crisis, and oﬃcesacrossthe state began refusingnewclients.Some judgesdragooned private lawyers,some ofthem ill-qualiﬁed, to actpro bono.Otherdefendants, such asthose “Grem-lins” unable to postbail—hard to contestwithouta lawyer—were leftto stewin jail.In January, in a suitbroughtin New Or-leans, a federal judge agreed thatthe statewas“failingmiserably” in itsdutyto indi-gentdefendants—85% ofthe total—butruled thatﬁxingthe problem wasthe legis-lature’sjob. (Asimilarsuitispending instate court.) Itistrue thatthe basic problemispolitical: speciﬁcally, the mismatch be-tween Louisiana’sappetite forprosecu-tionsand legislators’ reluctance to payforthem. The state hasthe highestincarcera-tion rate in the country, butthe most cock-eyed system forfundingpublicdefenders,who relyfortwo-thirdsoftheirincome onlocal courtfeesand ﬁnes, principally traﬃctickets, an erraticsource ofrevenue. The state itselfisalmostbroke, so un-likelyto stump up more. The upshot, says arecentstudybythe American BarAssocia-tion, isthatLouisiana hasonlya ﬁfth ofthelawyersitneedsto provide adequate pub-licdefence. While itsproblemsare ex-treme, though, theyare notunique. LastyearMissouri’schiefpublicdefenderde-spairinglytried to appointthe governor torepresentan indigentdefendant(he de-clined). In the pastFlorida’sdefendershave turned awayclients, too. Thisisa shortsighted economy. The par-ish jail in Abbeville isfull, so several“Gremlins” are housed elsewhere, foraprice. “Theycan’tgo to trial,” saysMrMarx,because, ashisquashingmotion putsit,“there isno possible method forprovidingcounsel forthem.” “I don’tknowhowlongthe system isgoingto letthem languish,”he says; “apparentlyindeﬁnitely.” In factveryfewcasesgo to trial in Louisiana: mostdefendantsplea-bargain, which the longremandsencourage, asdo these scarifyinggangcharges. Still, even MrStutes, the DA,sayshe isfrustrated. He sayshe expects atrial “atsome point”, butconcedesthat“we’re ata standstill”. “It’scountryhere,”saysanotherperson involved, “and theyjustdo whattheywantto do.” “Theymade a whole bigcircuswith ourlives,” saysMsWilliams. When DAs,judges, sheriﬀsand citypolice chiefs areelected, political posturingmaybe inevita-ble. Take MrHiggins. He resigned from thesheriﬀ’soﬃce amid tension overhismer-chandisingline. “Some horsesjustdon’trun with bitin theirmouth,” he reﬂected,sayinghe would “die ratherthan sacriﬁcemyprinciples.” He vowed to stickto “theLord’spath”, which turned outto lead notinto realitytelevision, asseemed possible,butto November’selection. Buoyed by hisviral videos, and despite fourmarriagesand allegationsofchild-supportarrears, hecampaigned in hiscowboyhatand isnowaUnited Statescongressman. 7The road to CongressThe EconomistMarch25th2017 UnitedStates35OUTin the savannah ofAmerican politics, the DemocraticPartylacksbigbeasts.

In a backhanded tribute to theirpower, PresidentDonaldTrump hasprepared a trap forDemocraticmunicipal leaders. Itisbuiltaround immigration enforcement, and the reluctance ofmanyurban leadersto worktoo closelywith federal immigrationauthorities—notablythe black-clad agentsofImmigration andCustomsEnforcement(ICE). One ofMrTrump’sﬁrstexecutive or-dersthreatensto denyfederal fundsto so-called “sanctuaryjuris-dictions”, meaninglocal governmentsdeemed to be shielding“removable aliens” from deportation. On March 20th, obeyingthatsame executive order, ICEissued the ﬁrstofwhatare to beweeklyreportstallyingrejected “detainer” requests. In plain lan-guage, the reportlistseach time thatlocal cityoﬃcials, police orprison oﬃcersdeclined to hold foreignerseligible for removallongenough forthem to be picked up byfederal agents.Some mayorssound readyto jump into MrTrump’strap, eyesopen, declaringthattheirﬁefsare indeed “sanctuarycities”—therebyreinforcingthe charge thatDemocratsare outof touchwith regularfolkwho wantsafe communities. MartyWalsh ofBoston hasoﬀered hisCityHall oﬃce asa “safe space” formi-grantsfearingdeportation. On the Democraticleft, there ismuchtalkofresistance. ForMrTrump—a man elected bythe America ofsmall towns, forgotten rustbeltcitiesand rural areas—such de-ﬁance isproofthatbigcitiesare sinksofdysfunction, run byliber-al elitestoo craven orcorruptto enforce the rule oflaw. Asa candi-date MrTrump broughtthe relativesofpeople killed by migrantsto rallies. Aspresidenthe accusessanctuarycitiesof causing“im-measurable harm to the American people”.Putmore simply, partisanson leftand rightsee an advantagein fear-mongering. In contrastMichael Hancock, the self-styledmoderate Democratwho hasbeen Denver’smayorsince 2011, be-lievesthatfearunderminesgood governance.

He avoidsthe label “sanc-tuarycity” and isadamantthatDenverdoesnotbreach the termsofMrTrump’sexecutive order. He isalso adamantthatthe newpresident’sapproach makeshiscitylesssafe. Since January, henotes, fourdomestic-violence casescollapsed aftervictims de-clined to testify, fearingdetention byICEagentsseen stakingoutthe municipal court. Denver, a cityofabout700,000 people, ishome to an estimated 55,000 undocumented immigrants, ac-cordingto the PewResearch Centre, a think-tank. Cityprosecu-torsreporta fall in callsreportingcrimesto police in districtslikeSun Valley, home to manyHonduransand othermigrants.MrHancockisto askICEto avoid detainingpeople insidecourthouses, justasagentsare currentlymeantto avoid arrestsatschools, hospitalsand churches. YetDenvertakesa more moder-ate line on workingwith the fedsthan citieslike San Francisco,where in 2015 a seriallydeported felon wasfreed to kill afterthethen-sheriﬀordered oﬃcersto avoid contactswith ICE. Denver’sposition ismore nuanced: the citynotiﬁesthe fedswhen a seri-ousoﬀenderisaboutto be released and honoursICE warrants.Butwhen ICEsimplyasksforsomeone to be held pasttheir re-lease date, withouta warrant, Denverdeclines. In part, thatisbe-cause Denverbelievesso-called “detainers” are unconstitutional.In part, the citybelievesscarce resourcesshould be focused on re-movingseriouscriminals. MrTrump’sgovernmentwantsto castabroadernet: in itsMarch 20th report, ICEchidesDenverforde-cliningto hold a Mexican accused ofdrunk-driving.Things to do in DenverSome Republicansargue thatAmerica’sfuture liesin admittinghighlyskilled legal migrantswhile crackingdown hard on illegalresidents. MrHancocksuggests, gently, thattheymisunderstandthe global contestfortalentand investment. Whywould skilledforeignerschoose a home thatisharshlyunwelcomingto othernewcomers, he asks? “Nobodywantsto live in fear,” he says, not-ingthatrecentchaotictravel banshave leftsome University ofDenverstudentsscared to travel home forspringbreak. Itmustbepossible to strengthen immigration enforcementwhile being hu-mane, he argues. “Itdoesn’thave to be either/or.”MrHancock’scityissolidlyDemocratic; just19% ofitsvoteswentto MrTrump. Buthisjob often involvespoliciesaﬀecting thewiderDenvermetro region. Thatrequirescoalition-building inRepublican-votingsuburbsand listeningto the concerns ofruralneighbours—includingfarmerswho relyon immigrantlabour.Asked ifthe Democrats’ concentrated successin citiesis itselfasortoftrap, the mayoragrees. He urgesDemocratsto become“the metro party”. Politics, metro-style, requiresappealing tomoderates, liberalsand even conservatives, he explains. Fornow,MrHancockisa bigbeastin municipal politics.

Itisareaslike thisthat havehelped to boostColombia’sestimated co-caine output37% since 2015 to an all-timehigh of710 tonnesin 2016, accordingtoAmerica’sgovernment. Some 188,000hectaresoflandisnowplanted with coca,up from a lowof78,000 in 2012. One reason forthe rise seemscounter-intuitive: the signinglastNovemberof apeace deal between the governmentandthe FARC rebel group. Itwassupposed toreduce coca cultivation; the FARC had ex-torted a taxon coca cropsand traﬃcked co-caine, and underthe peace deal itis to sup-portthe government’seradication eﬀorts.Butthe deal’stermswere yearsin the craft-ing, and manyofitsprovisionswere clearwell in advance—includingthattherewould be paymentsforcoca-farmerswhoshifted to diﬀerentcrops. The governmentcreated a perverse incentive to plant more.And asthe peace talksprogressed, thegovernmentscaled backaerial crop-spray-ing—accordingto itscritics, in order to pla-cate the FARC. In 2015 itsuspended spray-ingentirely, citinga studybythe WorldHealth Organisation concludingthatgly-phosate, the herbicide dumped outofplanes, was“probablycarcinogenic”. Instead, Colombia’sgovernmentisput-jured. The government’sintention isthatthe FARC’sco-operation will help to lessensuch resistance. Asthe guerrillasrelin-quish territoryand make the transition tocivilian life, ithopesthattheywill encour-age farmersto make the switch awayfromcoca. The FARC hasshown a “clearand de-ﬁnite” commitmentto convincingpeas-antsto give up coca, saysEduardo Díaz, thegovernment’sdirectorforcrop substitu-tion. Mauricio Jaramillo, a FARC com-manderin Guaviare province, saystheguerrillaswill have more inﬂuence thanthe government, because in manyparts ofthe countrycoca-growershave relativeswho are members.Butthe FARC were neverthe onlyarmed participantsin the drugtrade. Astheywithdraw, othercriminal groupsaremovingin, includingthe National Libera-tion Army, a smallerguerrilla outﬁt. Arge-lia’scoca farmershave a newslogan: “resis-tance”—to both the eradication pactsandthe newarmed groupstryingto muscle in. Some American oﬃcialsthinkthatstoppingaerial crop-sprayingwasa mis-take. BarryMcCaﬀrey, a retired generalwho oversawPlan Colombia, America’s15-year-longanti-drugseﬀortin the coun-try, underBill Clinton, told El Tiempo, adaily, that“the minute theydecided to stopaerial fumigation theylostcontrol over theproblem.” Butthe Americansare notpub-liclyadvocatinga return to spraying—notleastbecause proposed cutsto foreign aidwould make ithard to payfor. AtpresentColombia seemsdeter-mined to attackthe problem on theground, farm byfarm. Itneedsquicksuc-cessesto build trustamongcoca-growersand calm American fears. In the longerterm, though, so longasthe world retainsitstaste forcocaine, farmersand gangsterswill ﬁnd a wayto satisfythisdemand.Those who sprayare no match forthosewho pay. 7tingitsfaith in crop-substitution.

Forthe pasthalf-century, Latin Ameri-can politicianshave talked incessantlyaboutregional integration. Butthey havestruggled to make ithappen. Despite a bigincrease in trade agreementsamongLatinAmerican countriesthiscentury, theshare oftheirexportsthatstayswithin theregion hasremained stubbornlyaround20%, accordingto a newreportfrom theWorld Bank. Thatislowcompared withCanada and the United States(35%), EastAsia (50%) and 18 core membersoftheEuropean single market(60%).There are several reasonsforthis.ManyLatin American economiesaresmall, produce similarthingsand are sep-arated byhuge distances, all factors thattend to discourage trade. Thatisbadnews: trade boostseconomicgrowth, byincreasingeﬃciencyand bythe “learning”thatcomesfrom exportingto othermar-ketsorimportingmore sophisticatedgoods. And aftersixstraightyearsof eco-nomicweakness, Latin America iscastingaround fornewsourcesofgrowth.Some ofthe centre-rightgovernmentsthathave recentlycome to powerin SouthAmerica are keeneron open trade thantheirleft-wingpredecessors, especially inMercosur. Unfortunately, the biggestgainsin eﬃciencyand learningmightcome frommore trade with the United States, some-thingDonald Trump seemsuninterestedin. Butthere are otherthingsthe region cando to help itself. There ismuch talkin South America of“convergence” between Mercosurand thePaciﬁcAlliance, a free-tradinggroup com-prisingChile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.Nextmonth in BuenosAires, foreign minis-tersfrom both will meetforthe ﬁrst time.Yetthe groupshave diﬀerentrulesand phi-losophies; mergingthem isa technical andpolitical impossibility. One option wouldbe to use ALADI, a 1980 integration treaty,to harmonise and improve existingprefer-ential agreements, saysEnrique Iglesias, aLatin American elderstatesman. The easiestgainslie in tackling bureau-craticobstaclesto trade. Susana Malcorra,Argentina’sforeign minister, saysthatwith herMercosurcounterpartsshe hasidentiﬁed 80 such obstacles, such ascon-ﬂictingnormsand standards, which theywill tryto do awaywith. Theyhavepledged to unifyborderpostswhere thereare two, ason the riverUruguay. Bettertransportlinksand open-skiesagree-mentsare essential, too. Transport costsinSouth America are unusuallyhigh. The World Bankarguesthatregionaland global integration go hand in hand.MrTrump haskilled the Trans-Paciﬁc Part-nership; the PaciﬁcAlliance hopes to res-urrectitwithoutthe United States, linkingitsmembersto Asia. Mercosurretains fair-lyhigh external tariﬀsand hasfew tradedealswith others. Itismakinga fresh ef-fortto conclude long-stalled talks with theEU; an agreementwould provide a “roadmap and a corset” forliberalisation, saysMsMalcorra. ButwithoutBritain, the EUiseven lesslikelyto oﬀerthe market ac-cessMercosurwantsforitsfarm exports. The rhetoricofintegration masks of-ten-shamelessprotectionism bybusiness,especiallyin Argentina, Brazil and Co-lombia. Thishasbred cynicism. The pro-blem, saysRoberto Bouzas, a trade spe-cialistatSan Andrésuniversityin BuenosAires, ishowto translate the abstract de-mand forintegration into a concrete polit-ical agenda backed byorganised interests,and ﬁnd leaderswillingto carrythis out.There isa ﬂickerofhope. Forthe ﬁrsttime, saysMsMalcorra, there is“a verydetermined attitude from all the presi-dents”. Unfortunately, the region’sgov-ernmentsare politicallyweak.

Although certainlybrutal (he had hismostloyal adviser cutinto three piecesin 803), Harun al-Rashid isbestremembered forhislasciviousness,which inspired some ofthe raunchiesttalesin “The Arabian Nights”. Bycontrast, Raqqa’scurrentoverlord—the self-declared caliph ofa self-declaredcaliphate—will be remembered forun-leashinga spasm ofgrotesque violencethaterupted in Iraq and spread asfar astheshoresofLibya and the mountainsofAf-ghanistan. AbuBakral-Baghdadi will havealso presided overone ofthe shortest-lived“caliphates” in history.The fall ofthe capital ofIslamic State(IS), which the extremistscaptured in Janu-ary2014, looksimminent. Since Novem-ber, a combined force ofKurdish and Arabﬁghtersknown asthe Syrian DemocraticForces(SDF) hassweptthrough the desertfrom the north, sealingthe cityfrom thenorth, eastand west. Backed byairstrikesfrom the American-led coalition against ISand supported byAmerican special forceson the ground, the SDF’sclosestfrontline isnowjusta fewkilometresfrom the city. The coalition’splaneshave destroyedthe bridgesthatspan the Euphratesto thesouth, completingthe siege ofthe city. Air-dropped leaﬂetshave warned residentsnotto crossthe riverin ferryboats (IS hasused the boatsto reinforce the citywithmen and weapons). Both civiliansandﬁghtersare trapped. Asin itsdefence ofMosul, nowalsonearingitsend, IS hasburrowed a networkoffortiﬁed tunnelsbeneath Raqqa and pre-pared dozensofsuicide-bombersforits en-emies. Itsﬁghtershave booby-trappedhomes, ringed the citywith beltsofimpro-vised landminesand strungtarpaulinsacrossthe main streetsto conceal themfrom drones. Whetherthe ﬁghttakesweeksormonths, there islittle doubtthatIS will loseitscapital. Ofgreaterconcern, given theheadymixofcompetinginterestsin north-ern Syria, iswhatcomesnext. Manyques-tion the wisdom ofgamblingon the Kurd-ish-dominated SDF to liberate a citywhereArabspredominate. There are also fearsthatthe SDF’slinksto the regime mayre-store a degree ofgovernmentcontrol overthe city, which wasthe ﬁrstto fall to rebelforcesin the earlyyearsofthe revolution.The SDF recentlyceded control ofseveralvillagesto the governmentin a Russian-brokered deal thathasonlyintensiﬁedthese fears.“They[localsin Raqqa] wantto get ridofISbuttheyare reallyworried aboutwho’scomingto free them,” saysMoha-mad Shlash, a lawyerand formermemberofthe citycouncil. “IS isplayingon thesefears, tellingpeople thatthe SDF isfull ofatheistsand regime people who are com-ingto destroyIslam.”America’ssupportforthe SDF hasinfu-riated the Turkish government, whose en-mitywith the Kurdshasthreatened to de-rail the campaign againstIS.

Creaking at 60

As it marks its 60th birthday, the European Union is in poor shape. 
It needs more ﬂexibility to rejuvenate itself, argues John Peet

THE EUROPEAN PROJECT has sometimes given the impression of being
in perpetual crisis. Indeed, its spiritual father, Jean Monnet, saw this as
the best way to advance to his preferred goal of “ever closer union”, argu-
ing that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the sol-
utions adopted for those crises.” Yet as the union prepares to celebrate 60
years since its founding treaty was signed in Rome on March 25th 1957, it is
in deeper trouble than ever.
A big reason for this is the politics in EU member countries. Crucial
elections loom in many this year, and populist parties opposed to the
European project and in favour of referendums on membership of the
euro, the EU or both are likely to do well. In the Netherlands, Geert Wild-
ers’s anti-European Freedom Party gained seats in an election on March
15th, though fewer than many had feared. In France Marine Le Pen of the
National Front is expected to win a place in the second, run-oﬀ round of
the presidential election in early May, just as her father did in 2002. Al-
though, like him, she will probably lose, she will come closer to winning
than he did. And if she loses, it may be to Emmanuel Macron, who is run-
ning as an outsider with an untried political party.
Then in September Germany will go to the polls, and the anti-euro
Alternative for Germany party is likely to win its ﬁrst seats in the Bundes-
tag. Although Angela Merkel may yet remain chancellor, her new Social
Democratic challenger, Martin Schulz, is running close behind her in the
polls. Were he to replace Mrs Merkel, the shock to a European project that
she has largely led for 12 years would be profound. Italy must also hold an
election by early 2018; two of its leading parties have at diﬀerent times
called for a referendum on the country’s euro membership.
One reason for the likely success of populists against incumbents is
that Europe’s economic mood is so glum. Although growth has returned
and the euro zone has stabilised, growth rates are still low and, notably in

the Mediterranean, unemployment (especially among young
people) is punishingly high. Greece remains a basket-case on the
edge of default, and the markets are nervous about Italy and
France. Public debts across the union remain large, and progress
on liberalising structural reforms has largely stalled. The euro
zone has a partial banking union, a centralised bail-out fund and
a European Central Bank (ECB) prepared to act as a lender of last
resort, but its architecture remains incomplete and there is little
agreement over how to ﬁnish the job. 
Migration remains a huge issue. The numbers entering the
EU from the Middle East and Africa have come down a lot, but
mainly because of a questionable bilat-
eral deal with Turkey to close the main
transit route into Greece that could fall
apart at any moment. Hundreds of
would-be migrants still take to leaky boats
across the Mediterranean every week. The
distribution among EU countries of those
refugees who have got
through has
created serious tensions, with Germany particularly angered by
the refusal of central European countries to take more than a few.
Work to strengthen the union’s external borders has been ﬁtful at
best. Internally, the Schengen frontier-free system is troubled and
several border controls have been reintroduced. 
The deteriorating geopolitical environment makes matters
worse. Turmoil and war across the Middle East and in north Afri-
ca were one big cause of the surge in migrant inﬂows. An aggres-
sive Russia under President Vladimir Putin is now seen as a direct
threat, particularly in eastern Europe. Turkey’s president, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan, is turning his back on a club that seems to have
rejected his membership aspirations, and is spurning its demo-
cratic values as well. To cap it all, America’s new president, Do-
nald Trump, has shown himself hostile not just to multilateral
free trade and Muslim immigrants but intermittently to the EU,
praising Britain’s decision to leave and urging others to follow.
That points to perhaps the biggest current concern of all:
the EU’s unpopularity with both national governments and
their voters. Following last June’s referendum, in which the Brit-
ish voted to leave by 52% to 48%, their prime minister, Theresa
May, is about to trigger the two-year process for Brexit under Arti-
cle 50 of the EU treaty. Brexit may be more painful for Britain than
for its 27 partners, but it is still a threat to the future of a union that
has previously only ever expanded. Some politicians in other
countries have openly said that they want to follow Britain’s ex-
ample. The EU’s popularity ratings in other member countries re-

ceived a slight boost from the Brexit decision, but they remain
strikingly low by past standards (see chart).
Indeed, whenever any European treaty has been put to a
vote in recent years, it has been as likely to be rejected as ap-
proved. The Danes and the Irish are famous for having to be
asked to vote twice to produce the desired result. French and
Dutch voters sank the EU constitutional treaty in 2005. The
Dutch also rejected an association agreement with Ukraine last
year. In capitals around Europe, diplomats gloomily conclude
that there may never be another treaty, for at least one country
would surely fail to ratify it. 

Whenever any European treaty has been put to a vote
in recent years, it has been as likely to be rejected 
as approved

The Brussels institutions are not in much better shape. The
European Commission under Jean-Claude Juncker has com-
mendably slashed its output of red tape. Yet Mr Juncker was a
poor choice, forced on EU leaders by an ambitious European Par-
liament. The European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, has
sometimes been preoccupied with ﬁghting against the govern-
ment of his native Poland. The parliament continues to ﬂex its
muscles and accrete power to itself, yet voters disdain it. Turnout
in every single direct election since the ﬁrst one in 1979 has fallen,
hitting a new low of 42.6% in 2014.

When more Europe is not the answer

European leaders celebrating in Rome are well aware of
these problems. Their responses to similar troubles in the past
have fallen into two categories, neither of which seems adequate
this time. One is to follow Monnet’s advice and take a further
bold leap towards ever closer union. Since the Brexit decision
there has been much talk of a new Franco-German initiative to
relaunch the project. True believers like Guy Verhofstadt, a for-
mer Belgian prime minister who is now leader of the Liberal
group in the European Parliament and has just written a book,
“Europe’s Last Chance”, argue that, since the union’s troubles are
created mainly at national level, more Europe and a leap towards
ever closer union must be the answer.
Yet the evidence is that people in most member countries
simply do not agree. Brexit was a warning of what can happen
when the EU loses touch with voters. And
many governments also strongly disagree
with Mr Verhofstadt. Political leaders in
France and Germany now treat the union
as essentially an inter-governmental or-
ganisation and openly disparage the
European Commission and European
Parliament. During the euro crisis, Mrs
Merkel tellingly began talking of a “union
method” based on national capitals and
parliaments instead of the classic Monnet
method built around the EU institutions.
Even in Italy, Matteo Renzi, a passionate
pro-European, spent much of his recent
premiership attacking Brussels for exces-
sive rigidity in enforcing the euro’s rules.
That leaves the second type of re-
sponse, which is to muddle through. After
all, the euro and migration crises seem to
be past their worst. Excessive austerity

the countries of Europe move at diﬀerent
speeds, and not always towards the same
goal. Within the EU, this idea has a long
history. In 1975 the Tindemans report,
drawn up by a former Belgian prime min-
ister, ﬂoated the concept of a two-speed
Europe. In 1994 Edouard Balladur, then
France’s prime minister, proposed a Eu-
rope of three concentric circles: an inner
core of the single currency, a middle tier of
those in the EU but not the single curren-
cy, and an outer circle of non-members
with close links to the EU. In the same
year two German Christian Democrat
MPs, Karl Lamers and Wolfgang Schäuble
(now Germany’s ﬁnance minister), sug-
gested a central “hard core”.
The EU treaties were later amended
to allow “enhanced co-operation” of sub-
groups. In 2000 Joschka Fischer, then Ger-
man foreign minister, proposed an
“avant-garde” of countries ready to build
a federal Europe. Jacques Chirac, France’s
president, talked of “pioneer groups”. The
British preferred the term “variable geo-
metry”. In 2012 Jean-Claude Piris, a for-
mer chief legal adviser to the Council of
Ministers, wrote a book advocating a two-speed Europe.
The idea of enhanced co-operation has recently picked up
renewed interest. At an EU summit in Malta last month, Mrs Mer-
kel suggested her fellow leaders should commit themselves to a
union of “diﬀerent speeds”. The European Commission’s recent
white paper on the future of Europe suggested ﬁve options, one
of which was to move explicitly to a multi-speed Europe. The
French, German, Italian and Spanish leaders promptly sup-
ported the principle of this option, as did Joseph Muscat, prime
minister of Malta, which holds the rotating council presidency. 

Think again

Yet with small exceptions, these ideas have not borne fruit.
Enhanced co-operation has been used but thrice, for cross-bor-
der divorce, the European patent and property rights. Such a pau-
city of results partly reﬂects fears that a multi-speed, multi-tier
Europe could begin to undo the EU. This also explains the ad-
verse reactions to an August 2016 paper by a group of experts
published by a Brussels think-tank, Bruegel, entitled “Europe
after Brexit: A Proposal for a Continental Partnership”. Such a
partnership could, the paper said, oﬀer non-EU countries partial
membership of the single market without full free movement of
labour, and also create a system of decision-making that gave
them an informal say (but no formal vote) in rule-making. The
paper suggested that Britain, and perhaps others, might be inter-
ested. But both Brussels and national capitals dismissed the pro-
posal because it would let Britain have its cake (barrier-free ac-
cess to the single market) and eat it (limits on free movement).
The idea surely deserves another look. A union of 28, or
even 27, members is very diﬀerent from the original club of six.
There are countless examples of opt-outs from common policies,
ranging from large ones (staying out of the euro, common securi-
ty and defence policy or Schengen) to minor ones (controls on
purchases by foreigners of houses in Denmark and Austria, or
Sweden’s derogation from the rules for chewing tobacco and
selling alcohol). In this sense, a multi-speed, multi-tier union ex-
ists already. This special report will explore its wider promise,
starting with the most obvious example: the single currency. 7

may have done great harm, but outside Greece it is largely over.
The single market, perhaps the union’s greatest achievement,
has survived the ﬁnancial crisis and can surely weather Brexit.
Domestic security co-operation on terrorism and crime is closer
than ever. In foreign policy, EU countries have displayed com-
mendable unity over sanctions on Russia, and have been vital in
striking a nuclear deal with Iran. As economies improve and this
year’s tricky elections are negotiated, the union will somehow
manage to keep going.
This is indeed the most likely course of events, yet it carries
serious risks of its own. An unﬁnished euro may not be sustain-
able in the long run. If another ﬁnancial crisis were to hit, as at
some point it surely will, the currency could crumple. Worse,
both it and the broader EU remain vulnerable to a political acci-
dent at any time. Possibilities include a renewed Greek crisis, the
arrival of openly anti-EU leaders in France or Italy, or a ﬁrmer en-
trenchment in one or more east European countries of what they
call “illiberal democracy”. Given the challenges facing the union,
muddling through may no longer be the safest option. Brexit
could yet be copied by another member, leading to the slow col-
lapse of the union. As Sigmar Gabriel, now Germany’s foreign
minister, told the German weekly Der Spiegel in January, “it is no
longer unthinkable for [the EU] to break apart.”

Var iations on a familiar theme

What is really needed is a creative rethink of the entire Euro-
pean project. The most obvious idea is to drop the rigid one-size-
ﬁts-all model and adopt the greater ﬂexibility of a network. This
rests on three simple observations. The ﬁrst is that few of the 27
EU member countries that will remain after Brexit favour much
deeper political and economic integration. Second, these 27 are
integrated into the EU in many diﬀerent ways: all are in the single
market, 26 in the banking union, 21 in Schengen, a diﬀerent 21 in
NATO and 19 in the euro, to list just ﬁve examples. And third, the
European continent is home not just to the 28 EU members but 48
countries in all. Those outside the EU aspire to special relations
with the club, and some belong to bits of it already (see maps). 
Such heterogeneity could give rise to a scenario in which

Euro-zone members agree that the single currency
needs more integration, but disagree over how

MANY BRITISH TORY Eurosceptics trace their beliefs back
to the 1992 Maastricht treaty which agreed to create a single
currency. To them, Maastricht represented a Franco-German
stitch-up. The French president, François Mitterrand, accepted
German uniﬁcation, and in exchange the German chancellor,
Helmut Kohl, agreed to give up the D-mark for the euro. 
In fact money was crucial from the very start of the Euro-
pean project. In the 1950s Jacques Rueﬀ, a leading French econo-
mist, declared that “Europe will be made through a currency, or it
will not be made.” After the break-up of the Bretton Woods inter-
national monetary system in 1971, European countries made
many attempts, usually in vain, to ensure currency stability
through such arrangements as the “snake”, the European mone-
tary system and the exchange-rate mechanism.
A move to a single European currency may have seemed a
logical extension of such eﬀorts, yet it was far more momentous.
However ﬁxed an exchange-rate arrangement pretends to be, it
can be altered at any time. Indeed, that is what happened repeat-
edly in the 1980s and 1990s. The point of the single currency was
to put an end to such disruption. By launching the euro in 1999
and replacing national notes and coins in 2002, the EU was not
just underpinning the single European market, its most success-
ful project. It was also taking a giant leap towards deeper political
and economic integration. 
Yet the design of the euro suﬀered from two big defects that
still haunt the single currency today. The ﬁrst concerned the se-
lection of countries that were able to take on the discipline of
joining a single currency. Clearly France had to be a founding
member, but beyond that the German government thought that,
at least initially, the club should be kept quite small. The Maas-

tricht criteria setting debt and deﬁcit levels for would-be mem-
bers may not have made economic sense, but they made politi-
cal sense to Germans keen to keep out unreliable Mediterranean
countries, most obviously Italy. At Maastricht it was already clear
that Britain (and later Denmark) would stand aside. 
During the 1990s Italy, too, toyed with letting economic and
monetary union go ahead without it, partly because its public
debt was far above the Maastricht ceiling of 60% of GDP, but also
because its post-war economic success had been built on fre-
quent devaluations. Yet when Spain and Portugal showed them-
selves determined to join the euro from the start, Italy, as a found-
ing member of the club, felt it had to be there, too. The limits set in
both the Maastricht treaty and the later stability and growth pact
were fudged, so that at the outset the euro zone embraced 11
countries. Shortly afterwards Greece sneaked in as the 12th.

Don’t delay, reform today

At ﬁrst all went well, with robust growth and modest inﬂa-
tion. The Mediterranean countries beneﬁted from interest rates
converging downwards. But that meant they could avoid the
pain of pushing through structural reforms to make their econo-

mies more competitive. Many economists pointed out that such
reforms were more necessary than ever for countries no longer
able to devalue or run their own monetary policy, but politicians
were all too ready to avoid unpopular remedies. One result was a
worrying divergence in growth and unit labour costs, a proxy for
countries’ competitiveness (see chart on previous page).
That was to cause serious trouble when the second big de-
fect in the euro became apparent towards the end of its ﬁrst de-
cade: its ﬂawed architecture. There was a no bail-out rule but no
provision for what to do if national governments needed help, a
serious omission given that their debts were now, in eﬀect, de-
nominated in a foreign currency over which they had no control.
The euro had no central funds that could be drawn on to assist
members if they were hit by external shocks. Though banks had
become increasingly European in life, they remained unavoid-
ably national in death; yet national central banks had neither the
ability nor the resources to rescue or restructure the biggest ones.
The European Central Bank (ECB), for its part, was unable or un-
willing to act as a lender of last resort.

Enthusiasts for European integration did not see any of
these problems as insuperable, because they expected monetary
union to lead inexorably to closer political union. Many still do.
But there was little sign of this during the euro’s ﬁrst decade. Even
the budget-deﬁcit rules set by the stability and growth pact were
ignored, with France and Germany ironically being identiﬁed in
2003 as the ﬁrst rule-breakers. When in 2009 the single currency,
structurally vulnerable as it was, became engulfed by the biggest
global ﬁnancial crisis since the 1930s, its problems quickly be-
came glaringly obvious. 
The ensuing euro crisis has lasted for what seems like many
years. An emergency bail-out fund that later became the Euro-
pean Stability Mechanism (ESM) was established with the sup-
port of the IMF. First Greece and then successively Ireland, Portu-
gal, Spain and Cyprus were forced into bail-out programmes.
Because the crisis began in proﬂigate Greece, the prescribed cure
was usually ﬁerce public-sector austerity, even though in most of
the other countries excessive public spending and borrowing
were not the root problems. The turning-point came in July 2012, 

1

Exit strategy

Leaving the euro would be devilishly diﬃcult but not impossible

ONE BIG QUESTION has lurked throughout
the euro cr isis: should one or more members
quit? The most obvious candidate is Greece,
the country where the trouble began. It
never met the cr iter ia for joining, but its
deﬁcit and debt ﬁgures were misrepresented.
And the cr isis has inﬂicted agonies on the
Greeks. Pierre Moscovici, the EU’s economic-
and monetary-aﬀairs commissioner, notes
that Greece’s GDP per person has fallen by
45% since late 2009 and unemployment is
nearly 50%. This is the worst per formance
ever by any advanced country.
Now a fur ther row looms, over funds
needed for Greece’s third bail-out this sum-
mer. The IMF reckons that Greece will never
repay its debts, which currently amount to
180% of GDP and r ising. Yet euro-zone credi-
tors refuse to accept any debt relief, prefer-
r ing var iants of “extend and pretend” to
avoid owning up to ﬁscal transfers. Mean-
while Greece’s government rejects more
auster ity, just as Greek voters did in a refer-
endum in July 2015, only for it to be forced
on them all the same. Even so, Greeks do not
want to leave the euro—perhaps because for
them it has become like Alcatraz: a pr ison
that keeps people in mainly by making es-
cape too r isky. If an orderly procedure for
leaving the euro were available, a Greek
depar ture might become more attractive.
Oﬃcials say it cannot be done. Yet at
least twice in 2012, and again in 2015, the
German ﬁnance ministry spoke in favour of
it. The technicalities of returning to the
drachma could surely be managed. Existing
euro notes might continue to be used, per-

haps overstamped, as in the Czech-Slovak
currency split in 1993; in any case, ever more
payments are made electronically or by card.
Most Greek banks would go bust, but str in-
gent capital controls could be imposed, just
as they were dur ing the banking cr isis in
Cyprus in 2013. The ECB could provide the
Bank of Greece with plenty of liquidity. The
Greek economy, especially the tour ist in-
dustry, would quickly reap large beneﬁts
from a substantial devaluation.
It was two other considerations that
tipped the scales against Grexit. The ﬁrst was
the threat of contagion. If Greece lef t, the
myth that there is no way out of the euro
would be instantly exploded, br inging the
single currency closer to a ﬁxed exchange-
rate regime. The markets might fret that
Por tugal or even Italy could follow, pre-

saging the currency’s eventual collapse. Yet
Greece accounts for only 2% of the EU’s total
GDP, so if the EU fears that the depar ture of
such an economic tiddler could destroy the
euro, it has alarmingly low conﬁdence in its
own creation. Besides, institutional changes
have provided the euro with far stronger
defences than it had before.
The second objection is the potential
cost of Grexit, not only in suppor t for
Greece’s banks and people but through
“TARGET” balances at the ECB. These reﬂect
inﬂows and outﬂows of euros in national
banking systems, which usually attract little
attention. But the numbers have recently
r isen, a sign of renewed market nerves.
Greece and Italy at the end of January had
negative balances of over €70bn and over
€360bn respectively, whereas Germany had a
positive one of almost €800bn, its all-time
high (see char t). Were a country to leave or
the euro to break up, these balances would
probably crystallise into genuine (and surely
unpayable) claims.
Some economists have suggested that
Germany, not Greece, should temporar ily
leave the euro, and rejoin later at a higher
rate. The argument is that the underlying
causes of the euro’s problems are Germany’s
strong competitiveness and its huge current-
account surplus. Yet a German exit seems
politically implausible: the issue for markets
is Greece’s membership, not Germany’s.
Political or economic events could restar t
talk about Grexit at any time. It would be
prudent to prepare for the worst—and seek
to minimise the collateral damage.

when Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, declared that his institu-
tion was ready to do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.
This was followed by moves towards a banking union, with the
ECB taking over supervision of Europe’s largest banks.
In general, when compared with America and Britain, the
euro zone has been too quick to cut public spending and raise tax-
es; too slow to sort out its banks, many of which are still heavily
burdened with bad debts; and too hesitant to push through
structural reforms to its labour and product markets to improve
competitiveness. Yet despite these failings, the euro zone’s ills are
easily exaggerated. Klaus Regling, the managing director of the
ESM, likes to point out that, measured by GDP per person (rather
than absolute GDP) and employment (rather than unemploy-
ment) rates, the zone’s performance in the past 15 years has not
been so much worse than America’s. Today all members of the
euro zone, even Cyprus and Greece, are just about growing—and
all save Greece have regained access to capital markets.
In a sense, though, the euro’s problems have merely mutat-
ed from acute to chronic. Pierre Moscovici, the EU commissioner
for economic and monetary aﬀairs, complains that growth is still
too low; that diﬀerences between north and south remain large,
and convergence has stopped or gone into reverse; and that the
region suﬀers from serious imbalances, including a German cur-
rent-account surplus of almost 9% of GDP. Germany remains
overly dependent on external demand. Indeed, since the crisis
and the bail-outs, the entire euro zone has shifted to a large cur-
rent-account surplus, which may cause continuing tension with
big deﬁcit countries such as America and Britain.

The ins and outs

The composition of the euro zone, which since 2002 has ex-
panded to take in the three Baltic countries, Slovenia, Slovakia,
Cyprus and Malta, remains problematic. As one senior oﬃcial in
Brussels puts it, the euro works tolerably well for 16 of its mem-
bers, but not for three: Greece, Portugal and, most problemati-
cally, Italy. Indeed, the real threat to the euro may not be Greece,
given its small size. Many believe that the single currency could
even survive a Greek exit from the euro, though others are wor-
ried about it (see box, previous page). But Italy has seen no net
growth in GDP per person since the euro started in 1999, a calami-
ty for a developed country and a big reason why two of its main
political parties favour a referendum on euro membership. Italy
might be said to be both too big to fail and too big to bail.
There has been talk of a renewed Franco-German initiative
to relaunch and strengthen the euro after this year’s spate of elec-
tions, yet diﬀerences between the two countries run deep. Ger-
man oﬃcials were openly negative about the “ﬁve presidents’ re-
port” in 2015 (by the presidents of the European Commission, the
European Council, the Eurogroup of ﬁnance ministers, the Euro-
pean Central Bank and the European Parliament), which pro-
posed much deeper integration for the euro zone. The French are
keener on such ideas, but Germany holds the key. Even if Mrs
Merkel were replaced by Mr Schulz as chancellor, the Germans
would be unlikely to shift position that much.
That is because, as a recent book (“The Euro and the Battle
of Ideas”, by Markus Brunnermeier, Harold James and Jean-
Pierre Landau) shows, there are deep philosophical diﬀerences
between the two countries over how the euro should be run. The
French want to complete the banking union with a new system
of common deposit insurance and bank resolution. They favour
a gouvernement économique to counterbalance the ECB, with a
euro-zone ﬁnance minister, a euro-zone budget and even a euro-
zone parliament. They hope to move towards the creation of a
mutualised debt instrument or Eurobond. Yet they resist the im-
position of tougher ﬁscal restraints on national governments

and they dislike being told what reforms to undertake.
The Germans accept the need for deeper integration if the
euro is to survive, let alone thrive, but they object to how the
French propose to achieve it. They see demands for common de-
posit insurance, a euro-zone budget and Eurobonds as tricks de-
signed to transfer money from German taxpayers to proﬂigate
countries. They do not share the French taste for ﬂexibility in ﬁs-
cal policy, preferring discipline and rules. They fret that bail-outs
or debt restructuring create moral hazard, and experience has
taught them to take Parisian promises of reform with a large
pinch of salt. And even were a Chancellor Schulz more amena-
ble, hardline allies like the Dutch and Austrians would resist. 
The euro, in short, remains a troubled currency, with ques-
tion-marks over both its membership and its direction. There is
general agreement that it needs further integration, but disagree-
ment about how to go about it. Germany and other creditors feel
that they are being asked to show solidarity with other euro-
zone countries but are seldom oﬀered reform and budget disci-
pline in return. This has fostered an ugly anti-German mood in
some countries. Germany, in turn, complains about a lack of sol-
idarity in another area: immigration. 7

Immigration 

Compassion fatigue

Most EU countr ies are happy to welcome other
Europeans, but not refugees from outside

EUROPE’S GREAT MIGRATION crisis seemed to blow up
out of nowhere. Yet at least within the EU, increased move-
ment of people should not have come as a surprise. The admis-
sion of 11 countries from central and eastern Europe, between
2004 and 2011, and the end of the seven-year transition period
before allowing full free movement, was bound to encourage
people from the new member states to look for opportunities
abroad, given that wages and living standards in the west were
so much higher. A simultaneous upsurge of unemployment in
the south prompted a push north.
Higher immigration from outside the EU might also have
been predicted in light of the Arab spring, the 2011 intervention
led by Britain and France in Libya, the civil war in Syria and strife
in Afghanistan and Iraq. Be-
sides, in most EU countries the
population 
is
ageing
and
shrinking, but in Africa it is
young and growing fast. 
Yet the sudden inﬂow of
migrants from non-member
countries turned out to be po-
litically much more explosive.
At ﬁrst it was Greece that felt
the eﬀects most heavily, a dou-
ble whammy since it was also
at the centre of the euro crisis.
Spain had seen an earlier in-
ﬂux of migrants, notably to the
Canary Islands, but had largely
stopped it by doing deals with
source countries in west Afri-
ca. Italy is now the main recipi-

ent of illicit migration, in part because bilateral deals are impossi-
ble in lawless Libya. Economics, war and the lucrative business
model of people-smuggling have combined to destabilise the EU,
adding east-west tensions to north-south ones. 
The refugee convention and the Dublin regulation for asy-
lum-seekers have played a big part in this. The convention’s rela-
tively generous rules for accepting refugees were designed in 1951,
when refugee numbers were lower and people-smuggling was
not a big business. Under the Dublin agreement, applicants in Eu-
rope are required to apply for asylum in the ﬁrst country they
reach and have their cases adjudicated there, creating an obvious
problem for EU countries with southern borders. Yet for a time it
was easy to move through the Balkans into the frontier-free
Schengen system. In 2015 that brought in large numbers of
would-be refugees, with the net number of arrivals quickly reach-
ing a million.
It was very much to the credit of Angela Merkel, Germany’s
chancellor, when in August 2015 she extended a welcome to Syri-
an refugees. Yet her generosity backﬁred when it became clear
that other EU countries were, in eﬀect, funnelling refugees to Ger-
many (and Sweden, which had also opened its doors). For a while
Mrs Merkel’s popularity at home slumped, as the right-wing
nationalist Alternative for Germany party, and even the Bavarian
sister party of her own Christian Democrats, attacked her for be-
ing naive. The criticism became louder after a mass attack on Ger-
man women by north African migrants at Cologne station on
New Year’s Eve 2015.
The number of asylum-seekers has since come down (see
chart, previous page), mainly thanks to a bilateral deal struck in
early 2016 under which Turkey promised to stop would-be mi-
grants from crossing into Greece. In exchange Turkey received
money, a promise of visa-free access for Turks and a fair wind for

its EU membership application. At a time when the EU was also
condemning the Turkish government for its democratic short-
comings, this deal was widely seen as hypocritical. Yet an even
bigger concern was, and is, that Turkey’s mercurial president, Re-
cep Tayyip Erdogan, could tear up the agreement at any time.
Eﬀorts are also under way to stop the inﬂow of mainly eco-
nomic migrants from Libya. Under international law, upheld by
European courts, pushing back boats laden with would-be refu-
gees is forbidden. But national naval vessels are now trying to in-
tercept them closer to the Libyan coast and pull rather than push
them back. Elizabeth Collett of the Migration Policy Institute Eu-
rope, a think-tank in Brussels, huﬀs that this is an extremely ﬁne
legal distinction. 
Outﬂows from other source countries are also being
stemmed, and people-traﬃcking rings are coming under attack.
There is talk of setting up asylum-processing centres in north Afri-
ca, as long as the EU can ﬁnd what oﬃcials now call “safe places”,
not necessarily “safe countries”. Much money is also being spent
on strengthening the EU’s external borders.

None for us, thank you

Yet the ﬂow of migrants and asylum-seekers into Europe is
likely to continue, and their distribution within the EU is creating
huge problems. Germany and Sweden feel they have been land-
ed with an unfairly large share of the burden. German oﬃcials
criticise their EU partners for refusing to reciprocate the solidarity
they asked for during the euro crisis. They are particularly angry
with central European countries in the Visegrad group of Poland,
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, which have taken al-
most no refugees, in contravention of their obligations. Pascal
Lamy, a veteran former commissioner, reckons that the east-west
divisions created by the refugee crisis pose a greater threat to the

union than the north-south ones arising from the euro crisis.
British Eurosceptics see the EU’s migration crisis as evidence
that continental Europe shares Britain’s concerns about the free
movement of people. But they have got it wrong: the worries in
other EU countries are almost entirely about external migration,
not the movement of people and workers within Europe. Even so,
the migration crisis has clearly destabilised the Schengen system
of frontier-free movement. 
Schengen, which covers all EU countries bar Britain, Ireland,
Croatia, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, plus a clutch of non-
members, has been “temporarily” suspended in some places.
Austria has hardened its border controls. Hungary has built two
fences. One eﬀect has been to trap thousands of would-be refu-
gees in grim conditions in Greece and the western Balkans. It is
not clear when or even if Schengen will be fully restored.

Welcome, up to a point

No EU member other than Britain has said it wants to stop
the free movement of people, but the principle has been eroded
in several respects, starting with limits on welfare-beneﬁt entitle-
ments. Germany, the Netherlands and others have won several
cases in the European Court of Justice, establishing that people
from poorer east European countries are not entitled to claim im-
mediate welfare beneﬁts in richer EU members which often ex-
ceed median wages at home. 
The EU’s “posted workers” directive prevents central and
east Europeans from undercutting domestic wages and working
conditions in richer countries. But it allows them to pay welfare
contributions in their home countries, which has been controver-
sial in France, in particular. Some countries are trying to make it
harder for would-be workers to come in without a job oﬀer.
Countries outside the EU but in the European Economic Area
(EEA) can also in theory limit free movement, even though in
principle they are bound to oﬀer it. Liechtenstein, which is part of
the EEA, sets quotas on the number of outsiders it allows to live
and work there. Switzerland, which voted to restrict immigration
from the EU in a referendum three years ago, has had to climb
down, but it is at least being allowed to advertise jobs to Swiss
people ﬁrst.
The idea of free movement of labour was conceived at a
time when living standards within the EU were more homoge-
neous than they are today. At the time nobody could have predict-
ed the amount of movement triggered by the lifting of controls on
east European countries. The sending countries do not necessar-
ily welcome the outﬂow, either: although anxious to protect the
interests of their nationals abroad, they realise that a brain drain
of highly qualiﬁed workers may not be in their best interests.
In the proposal for continental partnerships by the Bruegel
think-tank mentioned in the introduction to this report, the free
movement of labour is not seen as a necessary part of a single
market. The report also points out that, whereas the single market
has lifted almost all restrictions on the movement of goods and
capital, it is far from complete for services. The provision of ser-
vices and mobility of labour, some economists note, tend to go to-
gether. And free movement is more essential for the euro zone
than for the wider EU since it can be a partial substitute for the loss
of currency ﬂexibility.
Brexit may mean that no country in the EU or the EEA will
challenge the free movement of people in Europe in the near fu-
ture. Besides, the numbers coming in from outside and moving
around inside may drop for a while. But all politicians want to be
able to respond to public opinion, so the principle may start to
fray at the edges. It could even become yet another example of the
variable geometry that Brussels purists hate so much. The same is
true of the EU’s foreign and security policy. 7

Foreign and secur ity policy

Home and abroad

European countr ies, inside and outside the EU, more
than ever need to work together 

THE EUROPEAN UNION is at heart an economic and trade
project built on its foundation as a customs union. The
1980s saw the addition of the single market, the world’s most
deeply integrated economic union, followed a decade later by
the launch of the single currency. But beyond ﬁnance and eco-
nomics, the EU has traditionally had few pretensions. In 1991
Mark Eyskens, then Belgium’s foreign minister, summed it up as
an economic giant, a political dwarf and a military worm. 
The focus on economics worked ﬁne so long as European
countries could rely for their security on NATO and the protec-
tion of the United States. This arrangement continued to func-
tion through the break-up of the Soviet empire and the expan-
sion of both NATO and, later, the EU itself. But with Russia led by
a newly belligerent Vladimir Putin, Turkey under an increasingly
distant Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Middle East a more violent
mess than ever, Britain preparing to leave the EU and an appar-
ently more isolationist America, it is no longer enough. The un-
ion clearly needs to focus more on strengthening its common for-
eign and security policy (CFSP). 
It is easy to overlook the CFSP’s achievements in recent
years. Thanks in good part to the need for unanimity among EU

member countries, the Brussels machinery can be cumbersome
or even paralysed by irreconcilable diﬀerences, as became evi-
dent during the second Gulf war in 2003. The European External
Action Service (EEAS), in eﬀect the EU’s diplomatic service, has
taken a while to establish itself. As for the “high representative
for foreign and security policy” established with the EEAS under
the Lisbon treaty of 2009, the very title has a ring of Gilbert and
Sullivan about it. 

Unsung heroines

Yet the ﬁrst two incumbents, Britain’s Catherine Ashton
and Italy’s Federica Mogherini, have chalked up many unsung
successes. These range from clearing pirates from the waters oﬀ
Somalia to establishing a relationship of sorts between Kosovo
and Serbia in the western Balkans. And despite Mr Putin’s best
eﬀorts, all 28 EU countries have stayed remarkably united behind
the sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea
and invasion of eastern Ukraine in early 2014. Above all, the EU
helped secure a nuclear deal with Iran in 2015. According to Sir
Robert Cooper, a former counsellor to the EEAS, this would not
have happened without it, working through an alliance of Brit-
ain, France and Germany. 
Perhaps the EU’s most successful foreign policy of all is its
own enlargement. Over the two decades since the collapse of the
Soviet empire in 1989-91, the European club has taken in no fewer
than 11 former communist countries from central and eastern Eu-
rope, helping to establish not just market economies but also lib-
eral democracy, sometimes in places that had next to no experi-
ence of the concept. The result has been good for both the
European economy and the entire continent’s security. It has
helped make the club more pro-American and pro-NATO and

less pro-Russian. 
Now, however, many of
these achievements are under
threat. It is not just that Mr Pu-
tin sees the EU as an enemy
and actively seeks to under-
mine it. The problems of the
Middle East and north Africa
also seem to be getting worse.
More worryingly, further EU
enlargement has more or less
stopped. That creates a conun-
drum: what to do about the
countries of the western Bal-
kans and Turkey, which will
clearly not become full mem-
bers in the foreseeable future?
Enrico Letta, a former prime
minister of Italy who two de-
cades ago wrote a book sup-
porting variable geometry, suggests the EU should have been less
dogmatic in the 1990s in insisting on full membership or nothing:
an intermediate form of associate membership might have been
better. There is now a real danger that some places could slip
away from Western inﬂuence. Mr Putin is interfering in the west-
ern Balkans, as is Mr Erdogan, who is also taking Turkey in an
ever more autocratic direction.
The biggest challenge, though, is the arrival of Donald
Trump in the White House. Many Europeans, like many Ameri-
cans, had hoped that he and his advisers would soon ditch the
more intemperate language that he used during his campaign.

But his early statements in oﬃce have conﬁrmed his protectionist
instincts, his criticisms of Europe for free-riding on the back of
American defence, his apparent eagerness to talk to Mr Putin, his
serious doubts about the value of the Iran deal and his backing
for hardliners in Israel. During his campaign he also made scorn-
ful remarks about both NATO and the EU and showed strong
support for Brexit.
So what should the EU do? Unity seems more important
than ever. The Europeans may have to ﬁght hard to defend the
Iranian nuclear deal. They will want to stick to a common line
over Russia, the Middle East and Israel. They may also need to
ﬁnd new ways to engage the western Balkans and Turkey. And in
all this, the EU countries should recognise that there is a strong ar-
gument for closely involving non-members, notably post-Brexit
Britain but also Norway and others. A CFSP without Britain
would be weaker and less eﬀective. Hence the need for some in-
stitutional innovation—observer status, partial or associate
membership—that brings Britain into the picture and helps to se-
cure its solidarity with its European partners.
The same applies to the debate on defence. Even before Mr
Trump’s complaints that America’s partners are not doing
enough, the case for more, and more eﬀective, defence spending
was already strong. All EU countries that are also NATO members
are in principle committed to its defence-spending target of 2% of
GDP, but few achieve it (see chart, previous page). Since Britain’s
Brexit vote there has been much debate in national capitals on a
new defence initiative, perhaps even setting up an operational
military headquarters, which will be easier to do without a carp-
ing Britain. A Franco-German push could help. France’s and Brit-
ain’s defence policies are increasingly linked, whereas Germany
remains a reluctant partner. In this area, more than any other,
keeping Britain involved makes obvious sense.

Secur ity begins at home

Justice and home aﬀairs and domestic security raise similar
issues. International co-operation in the ﬁght against terrorism
and organised crime is vital. As a former home secretary, Theresa
May, Britain’s prime minister, has repeatedly stressed the advan-
tages to Britain of working with other EU countries on such mat-
ters. When she chose to exercise the British right to opt out of a
string of justice and home-aﬀairs directives in mid-2014, she
promptly opted back into the most important ones, including
Europol, the European Arrest Warrant and the system of passen-
ger-name recognition. She has said that, after Brexit, she would
like to stick as closely as she can to these arrangements.
Denmark has an even more extensive opt-out from justice
and home-aﬀairs policies than Britain (which carefully retained
the right to opt back in to those that it liked). This has caused
many headaches in Copenhagen. Even though Denmark is a
member of the Schengen border-free zone, for instance, its access
to the vital Schengen information system is at best indirect. To get
around such problems, Denmark held a referendum in Decem-
ber 2015 on whether to end their Europol opt-out, only for Danish
voters to say no once more. 
Yet it would surely be wrong to allow politics or institution-
al inertia to interfere with essential co-operation in justice and
home aﬀairs, international policing or counter-terrorism. The
United States and Australia have association agreements that al-
low them to place liaison oﬃcers at Europol. But as Camino Mor-
tera-Marinez of the Centre for European Reform points out,
non-EU countries cannot participate in the European Arrest War-
rant. The European Court of Justice has also in the past stopped
data-sharing agreements with third countries that do not adhere
to EU privacy rules.
There is good reason not to allow non-members full partici-

pation in the single market, since that could undermine the prin-
ciple that the economic and trade privileges it confers are contin-
gent on accepting its rules and obligations. But such quid pro
quos do not apply to security policy, judicial matters or foreign
and defence policy. In these areas the more countries that can
join, the better. That certainly applies to Britain and Denmark.
This, indeed, was the thinking behind the “pillar structure”
set up by the 1992 Maastricht treaty, which was an attempt to
create common foreign and security policies and an area of free-
dom and justice on an inter-governmental basis, without super-
vision or interference by the EU’s institutions. Later treaties
folded these subjects back into normal EU rules and practice, al-
though most policymaking still retains the unanimity require-
ment. Yet the ﬂexibility of Maastricht could now be reclaimed in
a diﬀerent way, by engaging non-members more closely than be-
fore, without necessarily involving EU institutions or courts. One
reason for steering clear of them is that there remain plenty of
qualms about their legitimacy and democratic credentials. 7

Institutions

Democracy and its
dilemmas

The EU’s institutions need reform

THE EU’S INSTITUTIONS, built up over six decades, are not
ideally suited to responding ﬂexibly to challenges such as
the single currency, migration or foreign and security policy. The
club remains vulnerable to the charges of operating with a
“democratic deﬁcit” that alienates many voters.
Start with what is still the central institution, the European
Commission. Headed by Jean-Claude Juncker, a long-time prime
minister of Luxembourg, it is much more than a civil service; it is
the guardian of the treaties, the originator of almost all legisla-
tion and the sole executor of the EU’s budget. By the standards of
most governments it is also small, employing only around
33,000 people—about the same as a largish local council in one
of the member countries (though commission staﬀ command
much more lavish salaries).
The Juncker commission has done some good things; in
particular, it has sharply reduced the volume of regulation it pro-
poses. Yet it suﬀers from having too many commissioners (28,

nance ministers, the European Central
Bank and the European Parliament, to
name but six. But the increasing promi-
nence of the European Council of heads
of state and government reﬂects the reali-
ty that, when important decisions have to
be made, it is national governments, not
EU institutions, that do most of the hard
bargaining. To some extent power has
shifted from Brussels to national capitals.
Or rather (and there lies the rub), to
one capital. The growing dominance of
Berlin is a cause of anxiety not just in
Brussels but in other capitals (including
Berlin itself). It was perhaps inevitable
during the euro crisis since Germany is, in
eﬀect, the system’s paymaster. But the
habit of letting Germany, and especially
Mrs Merkel, decide has increasingly taken
hold across the board. Germans occupy
many key posts in the commission and
parliament. Brexit will make matters
worse, because it will break up the trio of
Britain, France and Germany that has for
many years been at the heart of the Euro-
pean project. That will expose the con-
trast between French weakness and Ger-
man strength even more starkly, at an
awkward political moment.
Mrs Merkel is widely admired, and
careful not to seem too dominant. But neither she nor a putative
Chancellor Schulz can compensate for France’s inadequacies.
The European project was conceived by French leaders to be
headed by their country—one reason they tried hard to keep Brit-
ain out. Now their worst fears of dominance by others are being
realised, not from across the Channel but from across the Rhine. 
As an international bureaucracy, the EU has spawned
many other bodies, some of them of dubious value. A number of
them have been scattered around national capitals as sweeten-
ers to keep the countries concerned loyal to the project. Perhaps
the most preposterous pair are the Economic and Social Com-
mittee, which brings together trade union and civil representa-

When impor tant decisions have to be made, it is
national governments, not EU institutions, that do most
of the hard bargaining

tives for monthly meetings, and the Committee of the Regions,
which does the same for regional authorities. Between them
these two Brussels-based bodies cost over €200m a year to run.
Hardly anybody, even in Brussels, would notice if they were to
disappear tomorrow.

No laughing matter

That is not true of the EU’s main representative institution,
the European Parliament. Since direct elections were introduced
in 1979, its powers have been increased by every treaty, to the
point where it is now largely a co-equal legislator with the Coun-
cil of Ministers. At French insistence it still moves pointlessly be-
tween Brussels and Strasbourg every month, at an annual cost of
some €114m. Many MEPs are impressively well-qualiﬁed and do
an excellent job, often better than their national counterparts, in
improving legislation and in questioning commissioners and

one per member country), a defect that has been only partially
dealt with by the creation of senior vice-presidents and junior
commissioners. One consequence is that, even more than be-
fore, the commission is more or less run by Mr Juncker’s power-
ful cabinet under Martin Selmayr, a German oﬃcial. The com-
mission has also allowed itself to be inﬂuenced too heavily by
the European Parliament, the only institution that can dismiss it,
instead of acting as a balance between the Council of Ministers
(representing national governments) and the parliament as the
two co-legislators in the system.
Commissioners are appointed by their national govern-
ments, but are subject to conﬁrmation by the European Parlia-
ment. The commission president is now
indirectly elected under a process called
Spitzenkandidaten (tellingly, a German
word), introduced in 2014. Egged on by
certain MEPs, the main cross-border polit-
ical groups designated their preferred can-
didates for the job ahead of that year’s
European elections. Most national governments ignored their
suggestions, but when the centre-right European People’s Party
(EPP) emerged as the biggest political group, the European Coun-
cil felt obliged to choose the EPP candidate, Mr Juncker, even
though EU heads of government, including Angela Merkel and
David Cameron, had serious reservations. Leaders dissatisﬁed
with the outcome in 2014 say they are determined to ditch the
Spitzenkandidaten process for the next election in 2019, but they
may ﬁnd it hard to put a stop to it.
By contrast, the innovation of appointing a permanent
president of the European Council has proved a success. That
owes something to the job’s ﬁrst two incumbents, Herman Van
Rompuy and Donald Tusk, former prime ministers of Belgium
and Poland respectively. True, the EU now suﬀers from an inﬂa-
tion of presidents: of the European Commission, the European
Council, the (rotating) Council of Ministers, the Eurogroup of ﬁ-

the European Central Bank. Moreover, unlike other EU institu-
tions, the parliament has room for anti-EU politicians. Nigel Far-
age, a British MEP and former leader of the UK Independence
Party, memorably noted last June that when he arrived he was
laughed at, but after the Brexit vote “you’re not laughing now.”
Yet as an institution seeking to bring voters closer to the
European project, the parliament must still be judged a failure. It
may frighten the commission, but it does not exert the sort of con-
trol over governments that national parliaments aspire to. Its link
to voters is tenuous: turnout in European elections is low and
falling, and voters tend to decide largely on national not Euro-
pean issues. Far from acting as a parliament that controls spend-
ing and curbs the executive, the European Parliament has often

behaved more as a lobby group whose main aim seems to be to
spend more and to augment its own powers.
One way of remedying this would be to increase the role of
national parliaments. Many experienced EU oﬃcials regret the
switch from a European Parliament made up of nominated na-
tional MPs to a directly elected institution, breaking the link be-
tween national and EU-level politics. National politicians in
many countries remain shamefully ignorant of the EU and its
rules, and too few MEPs see it as part of their role to help educate
them. Indeed, many national parliaments have cast doubt on the
European Parliament’s democratic credentials, as has the Ger-
man constitutional court. Yet the parliament is hardly likely to
vote for its own demise.

Who rules the rulers?

The EU needs more leverage over errant members

AS THE EUROPEAN project grew from six
reasonably cohesive members to 28 more
diverse and less controllable ones, it was
faced with two big questions. One was what
to do if a country decided to leave. The
response of the United States to South
Carolina’s secession in 1860 seemed exces-
sive, so instead the treaty was amended to
include Ar ticle 50, which sets out the proce-
dure for exit. The hope was that it would
never be used, but now Br itain is invoking it.
Untr ied though the procedure is, one thing
seems cer tain: it will be long-drawn-out and
painful for everyone.
The second question was what to do if a
country star ted to trample on the democrat-
ic standards that are a condition of member-
ship. Europe has had to consider this issue
before, in 2000, when Austr ia brought Jörg
Haider, a far-r ight politician, into a coalition
government. The EU tr ied to isolate Austr ia
by freezing contacts, but when that failed to
oust Mr Haider it gradually thawed, and has
since tacitly accepted governments sus-

tained by extremist par ties. In the 2000s
several commentators suggested that Italy
under Silvio Berlusconi would have failed the
Copenhagen cr iter ia for membership be-
cause he wielded such enormous power over
the Italian media, but at the time nothing
was done about it. 
The underlying diﬃculty, as David
McAllister, a German Chr istian Democratic
MEP, puts it, is that the EU has a great deal of
leverage over applicant countr ies but almost
none over members. It can suspend voting
r ights under Ar ticle 7, which is a sor t of
nuclear option. But whereas a new applicant
can be restrained if it strays oﬀ the demo-
cratic course, an existing member that ﬂouts
the rules cannot easily be disciplined. And
now the EU is unsure what to do about two
such countr ies.
The ﬁrst is Hungary, where Viktor
Orban’s Fidesz government, elected by a
huge major ity in 2010, quickly began to
over turn European norms. Mr Orban, whose
par ty had a major ity big enough to change
the constitution at will, inter fered with the
central bank, the constitutional cour t and
the media. He even gave a speech in July
2014 extolling the vir tues of an “illiberal
democracy”. Yet he has been careful not to
go too far, pulling back from head-on con-
frontation with Brussels and using his
par ty’s membership of the main European
centre-r ight grouping, the European Peo-
ple’s Par ty, to fend oﬀ cr iticism.
The Polish government, led by Jaroslaw
Kaczynski and his Law and Justice (PiS) par ty
since late 2015, presents a more ser ious
problem. The EU accuses PiS of breaking the
rules over the constitutional cour t and the
appointment of judges. It frets, too, over
media freedom. Frans Timmermans, a com-
mission vice-president, has been trying to
negotiate a solution; Angela Merkel recently

Nationalist Kaczynski

visited Warsaw. Yet the PiS government
rejects all outside cr iticism. Konrad Szyman-
ski, Poland’s Europe minister, says simply
that the government was democratically
elected and has the suppor t of voters for
what it is doing. He adds pointedly that it is
western, not eastern, Europe that has seen
the biggest recent upsurge in anti-EU popu-
list par ties. 
Unlike Fidesz in Hungary, PiS in Poland
has a proper opposition, so the next election
could solve the problem. But unless it does,
the Poles will continue to be troublesome.
Piotr Buras of the Warsaw oﬃce of the Euro-
pean Council on Foreign Relations, a think-
tank, notes that the government disagrees
with the EU over the euro, democratic norms
and even defence and foreign policy. It is
almost as negative as pre-Brexit Br itain. This
suggests the EU could do with a new category
of associate membership, serving as a half-
way house for applicants not yet ready for full
membership but also as a naughty step for
members that backslide too much.

Instead, it might be used to help ﬁll the EU’s famous demo-
cratic deﬁcit. Most talk of such a deﬁcit is wrong or exaggerated:
EU lawmaking is in many ways more transparent than national
lawmaking, and national governments usually have to approve
EU laws in the Council of Ministers, although they may pretend
otherwise. The place that may be suﬀering most from a demo-
cratic deﬁcit is not the union as a whole but an increasingly inte-
grated euro zone. As it penetrates more deeply into national ﬁs-
cal and other domestic policies, the case for a democratically
elected chamber to keep it in check is becoming stronger. 
One idea would be to reconstitute the European Parliament
so that it represents only the euro zone. That could become part
of a new architecture which would also feature a new euro-zone
ﬁnance minister as well as a euro-zone budget that would act, as
in any federal system, to smooth out diﬀerences in economic per-
formance between the constituent parts. MEPs from non-euro
countries might revert to being nominated by national parlia-
ments. That would mean much of the wider EU budget could be
scrapped; most farm support has been detached from produc-
tion, so it could be renationalised, and regional spending could
continue within the euro zone but not in the rest of the union.
Such innovations would confer greater legitimacy on the Euro-
pean Parliament and give it a role, but only in the central core, not
the wider EU. For countries thinking of joining or quitting the
euro, a euro-zone parliament might also bring home to them
how momentous a step that would be. 7

A multi-speed, multi-tier future

Diﬀerentiate or bust

The EU must embrace greater diﬀerentiation or face
potential disintegration

IS EUROPE READY to embrace a new model built around
not sameness but diﬀerence? Although the recent commis-
sion white paper and several national leaders have come out for
a multi-speed Europe, they really have in mind a way for small
groups of countries to go forward in such areas as defence or tax-
ation, without having to wait for all, using the treaty’s tools that
allow enhanced co-operation. A true multi-speed, multi-tier Eu-
rope would be far more ambitious. Yet the troubles of the EU
may seem to many quite enough to worry about without having
to rethink the structure of their project.
That is certainly the message coming from national capitals
and Brussels. Asked about how euro and non-euro countries
will co-exist in future, one senior oﬃcial in Paris notes that, after
Brexit, nearly 90% of the union’s GDP will be generated by the
euro zone. Others say all non-members except Denmark will
join the euro within ﬁve years. The rows over asylum-seekers be-
tween east and west will similarly end, says a Eurocrat in Brus-
sels, because central Europe gains so much from the EU. Brexit
will hurt Britain more than its partners. And ideas for more vari-
able geometry, such as the “continental partnerships” touted by
Bruegel, are “suitable for think-tanks”, as another senior oﬃcial
(this time in Berlin) puts it, not to be taken seriously.
Yet this is too complacent. The union will have non-euro as
well as euro members for years to come. The migration crisis is
not turning the citizens of central Europe into good Europeans;
instead, some are attacking the union’s core principles. And al-
though Brexit does seem likely to damage Britain more than the
EU, the decision of a majority of voters in a large member coun-
try to leave is a huge indictment of the whole organisation, grave-
ly weakening it in the eyes of the world.

A Europe for all reasons

A more diﬀerentiated Europe, based around the idea of
variable geometry, a range of speeds or concentric circles, would
be a good way to ease the tensions and problems that aﬄict the
present, overly rigid EU. At the centre would be the 19-member
euro zone, which will need deeper political and economic inte-
gration to survive. Next would be full EU members that are not in
the euro. In principle, it would be helpful if those that ﬁnd euro
membership too demanding, or are not prepared to embrace the
political integration it implies, were able to migrate into this loos-
er second grouping without undermining or destroying the sin-
gle currency. The main candidate for such a move is Greece, but
there could be others in the future.
A third tier could then take in countries that do not cur-
rently want to join the EU but would like to participate as fully as
possible in the single market. This would entail payments into
the EU budget and a willingness to abide by almost all of the
club’s rules, including, in eﬀect, an acceptance of the jurisdiction
of the European Court of Justice. This group would take in the
three members of the European Economic Area—Norway, Ice-
land and Liechtenstein—and, albeit in a slightly looser relation-
ship, Switzerland. Again, others might aspire to join this group.
Beyond these three tiers would be a fourth set of countries
that are unwilling to accept the rules made in Brussels but still

want a deep and comprehensive free-trade arrangement with
the EU. Some of these might also wish to be closely linked,
through some form of observer or associate status, with the EU in
foreign and defence policies and in domestic security issues. Brit-
ain is the most obvious candidate for such a group. But Turkey
and some western Balkan countries might also be interested,
and perhaps one day Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and even Bela-
rus might be added to the list. This tier, or something like it, might
also become a home for countries that either choose or are asked
temporarily to suspend their EU membership. 

Diﬀerent, not lesser

Why does the idea of institutionalised variable geometry
provoke opposition? There are three answers. One is that coun-
tries in the outer tiers might feel they have been given second-
class status. Even Britain, a ﬁrm believer in variable geometry,
long fretted over the creation of a two-speed Europe built around
the single currency, fearing that the real power and decision-
making would be exercised by the inner circle. It is notable that
the euro zone on its own now constitutes the “qualiﬁed major-
ity” needed for the Council of Ministers to approve legislation.
Denmark, which has long had several opt-outs, has been
similarly sensitive to being treated as an outsider. In the 1990s Ita-
ly felt that it needed to be in the euro from the start to avoid rele-
gation. Greece and, later, several central European countries re-
peatedly objected to the idea of a two-speed Europe. Jaroslaw
Kaczynski, the de facto leader of Poland, recently declared that
this would lead to the “breakdown, in fact the liquidation of the
European Union in its current sense”.
Yet such fears seem largely groundless. With variable geo-
metry already so extensive, the idea of a ﬁrst, superior class of
highly integrated members and a second, inferior class of more
loosely associated ones no longer stacks up. Indeed, some coun-
tries might be better oﬀ standing aside from ventures they are not
ready for, even if it involves some sacriﬁce of broader inﬂuence.
Uﬀe Ellemann-Jensen, a Danish former foreign minister, recalls
that at the time of Denmark’s Maastricht opt-outs, such thinking
was captured in the phrase: “To be or not to be, that is the ques-
tion; to be and not to be, that is the answer.” 
This leads to the second reason for dismissing the idea,

which is the opposite of the ﬁrst:
the fear that, unless everyone is
prepared to agree on common
principles and an ultimate goal,
the club might slowly but surely
fall apart. That was why purists
always objected to British and
Danish opt-outs. After the col-
lapse of the Soviet Union, appli-
cant countries from eastern Eu-
rope were presented with a
take-it-or-leave-it choice: if they
wanted to join the EU, they
would have to accept the entire
acquis communautaire, includ-
ing commitments to Schengen
and the euro.
As Britain negotiates its
way through Brexit, it is faced
with the same attitude: any spe-
cial access to the single market
or other forms of co-operation
are out, since they are available
only in return for taking on all
the union’s obligations. A multi-
speed, multi-tier Europe con-
jures up a vision of the dreaded
“cherry-picking”, 
in which
countries take the beneﬁts of the
EU without paying the appropri-
ate price. To concede this, the
thinking goes, is to risk destroy-
ing the union. Those who feel this way point out that golf clubs
do not allow outsiders to change the rules and play whenever
they choose. Yet this is a false analogy. Most golf clubs have many
categories of membership, and most allow non-members to
play at less busy times.
When the Treaty of Rome was signed 60 years ago and the
club had only six members, a single class of membership made
sense. With 28 members, and even with 27, one size is much less
likely to ﬁt all. It seems probable that the current overlapping
memberships of the euro, NATO, parts of the single market,
Schengen and co-operation on domestic security will persist for
a long time, possibly for ever.
The third argument against variable geometry, again ex-
pressed by a senior Eurocrat, is that too much variation would
turn the union into an ineﬀectual organisation reminiscent of
the Holy Roman Empire. Yet this analogy does not work either.
True, the empire was disparaged by one Frenchman, Voltaire, as
“neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire”, and later puﬀed out by
another, Napoleon. But Charlemagne’s creation proved suﬃ-
ciently ﬂexible and decentralised to survive wars, plagues and
religious upheavals. It repeatedly shed and gained territory, at
diﬀerent times taking in chunks of France, the Low Countries
and northern Italy as well as the core German provinces (but
never Britain). In so doing, it mostly brought more peace, pros-
perity, freedom and security to its inhabitants than were enjoyed
by the rest of Europe—and it lasted for 1,000 years. 
If it is too early to tell whether the Holy Roman Empire was
a success, listen to one of Aesop’s fables, dating back 2,500 years.
It is about a reed growing by a river alongside a mighty oak. The
oak taunts the reed for being weak and having to bend with ev-
ery breeze. But one day a great storm blows up and topples the
oak, whereas the reed remains standing. There may be some-
thing to be said for ﬂexibility. 7

The obviousbeneﬁciaryofMrFillon’sdisastrouscampaign isMrMacron, a for-mereconomyministerand bankerwho fa-voursfree trade and the European Union.Pollssuggestthe 39-year-old isroughlytiedwith MsLe Pen forthe ﬁrstround, witheach backed bya quarterofthe voters.

MrFillon’sglimmerofhope isthatsupport forMrMacron, a newcomerto electoral cam-paigning, isnotsolid: some ofhisbackerscould switch aftera blunder, orifhis poli-ciesare seen astoo liberal. Thatglimmerisonlyfaint. In the debateon March 20th, MrMacron acquitted him-selfcreditablyduringmore than threehoursofverbal melee between the ﬁvemain candidates. Attimeshe waﬄed,boastingofhispragmatism while avoidinganyspeciﬁccommitments. (MsLe Penlanded a good line, congratulatinghim forspeakingforseven minuteswithoutsay-inganything.) On foreign aﬀairsand migra-tion he referred relentlesslyto the need toworkwith the EU, which more Frenchviewunfavourablythan favourably. Butthree snap pollssuggested thata pluralityofthe viewersthoughtMrMacron hadwon the debate. Anotherpoll found thathissupportershad become a bitmore sureoftheirchoice. MrMacron’smostmemorable momentwasan angryexchange overMuslim inte-gration with MsLe Pen, whom he called athreatto national unity. Thatclash maywell setthe tone forthe campaign. Thefront-runnershold contradictoryopinionson nearlyeverytopic. MrMacron’sstrongapproval ofthe EUprovoked scorn andgurningfrom the leaderofthe NationalFront. He in turn ridiculed herpraise ofBritain’sBrexitdecision as“formidable”. In fact, MrMacron mightdo bestto at-tackMsLe Pen’sincoherenteconomicplans. Generallya strongspeaker, she isnotﬂuentwhen pressed on hermutuallycontradictorygoalsofboostingpublicspendingenormouslywhile tryingtowithdrawfrom the euro and restructurethe national debt.

Mostofthese clashesare emptypostur-ingbyleaderswho are facingelections orotherdomesticchallenges. Buttheyhavehad one real consequence: Western gov-ernmentshave become alarmed enoughto startpayingattention again.

The result isaplan fora western Balkan common mar-ket, backed both bylocal leadersand bythe EUitself.On March 16th, ata summitin Sarajevowith the prime ministersofthe sixBalkancountriesthatwantto join the EU, MrHahn told them to seize the moment.When theymeetagain in Trieste on July12th, he wantsthem to sign up to a plan foraregional common market, with freetrade, free circulation oflabourand capital,and regulatorystandardisation. Serbia and Albania are all forit; indeed,theirleaderssayitwastheiridea. “Serbiawould like to playthe role Germanyplaysin the EUwithin thisgroup,” saysone dip-lomat. Montenegro and Kosovo, however,are alarmed. Montenegro iswell advancedon itspath to EU accession, and fearsthatthe newplan will onlyhold itup. MrHahn saysthe plan could create upto 80,000 jobs. Foreign investorswill see amarketof20m people ratherthan sixsmallcountries. In fact, much ofwhatMrHahnwantsto do isalreadyunderway. An in-complete free-trade area exists, though in-tra-Balkan trade remainsfeeble. There isawestern Balkan energycommunitylinkedto the EU, and a treatyintegratingtransportpolicyisreadyto sign.

Backin Turtle BayAntónio Guterres, the UN’ssecretary-gen-eral since the startofthe year, has beencareful notto picka ﬁghtwith the Ameri-can president. MrGuterresand the envoysofjustaboutall governmentsrepresentedatthe UN are pinningsome hope on NikkiHaley, MrTrump’sambassadorthere. Ac-cordingto a UN insider, “she hasbeen try-ingto reassure everyone in the UN thatallthese statementsfrom the Trump camp arejustnoise.” In the pastweekthatwill havegotmuch harder.MrGuterres, who hasa reputation asaconsensus-builder, hasquietlyletit beknown thathe will embarkon a cost-cut-tingand streamliningcampaign ofhisown. Britain, France and America havetended to worktogetherin the SecurityCouncil, often in opposition to the othertwo veto-wielders, China and Russia. Nowthe British and French are hopingdesper-atelyto bind MrTrump backwith theminto the UN system, fearinghe maycosy upto Russia’spresident, VladimirPutin, or bydefaultletChina make the running. “Thatwould marka reallydangerousshiftin powerdynamicsatthe UN,” saysthe formerObama oﬃcial. “Everythingsofarwith thisadministration hasbeen sohaphazard. It’sall so hard to predict.” Con-gressmaypersuade MrTrump to see meritin some aspectsofthe UN. Butthat, rightnow, seemslike a losingbattle. 7ATHOME and abroad, one clearresult ofDonald Trump’sproposed budgetwould be to push green programmesintothe red. Between 2010 and 2015 America in-creased itsclimate-related spendingin de-velopingcountriesfourfold. Itlavished$15.6bn on projectsforclean energy, betterland useand infrastructure suited to awarmingworld. Cuttingsuch schemesisbad enough. ButforAmerica to step downasan environmental champion isworse.International deal-makingwill slowwith-outitscloutand diligence, othercountries’emission-cuttingeﬀortswill shrink, andlaggardssuch asSaudi Arabia and Russiawill see no reason to catch up. The proposed budgetwould eliminatemoneyforthe Global Climate Change Ini-tiative, the federal government’shub foroverseasenvironmental support. Itwouldalso aﬀectentitiessuch asthe Green Cli-mate Fund—setup in 2010 aspartofan in-ternational pledge to transfer$100bn ofcli-mate cash a yearfrom rich countriestopooronesby2020—and the Climate In-vestmentFunds, supported byGeorge W.Bush’sadministration with $2bn partlytoboostrenewablesabroad. SqueezingtheState Departmentwould mean thatdevel-opmentbanks, which backgreen projectsaround the world, could lose $650m.International climate fundingcomesfrom a mixofgovernments, multilateralagencies, banksand developmentgroups.The OECD, a group ofmostlyrich coun-tries, estimatesthatpoorcountriesre-ceived $62bn in publicand private climateﬁnance in 2014, up from $52bn in 2013. Butdomesticspendingdwarfsinternationalcontributions. And some importantUNinitiativesrequire little to run.Take the UN FrameworkConventionon Climate Change, a green treatyadoptedin 1992, underwhich the Parisagreement tolimitglobal warmingto “well below” 2°Cabove pre-industrial temperatureswasadopted in 2015. America coversaboutaﬁfth ofitsadministrative budget. It isalsothe world’slargestcontributorto the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, agroup ofscientistswho advise govern-mentson global warming. The annualsumsforsuch bodieshave been small:roughly$5.4m and $3.1m respectively. Oth-ercountriescould compensate.One contenderisChina. Co-operationbetween BarackObama and Xi Jinpingmade the Parisagreementpossible. AndafterMrObama pledged $3bn fortheGreen Climate Fund in 2014—ofwhich hemanaged to delivera third before leavingoﬃce, makingAmerica amongitslargestdonors—China oﬀered up $3.1bn in climatecash. AsChina, the world’slargestpolluter,getsricher, itisessential thatitplays itspartin payingformitigation and adaptation toglobal warming, saysLeonardo Martinez-Diazofthe World ResourcesInstitute, a glo-bal research body. Cash once lured developingcountriesto the table atclimate talks. Thatis chang-ing, saysJamesCameron, the chairman ofthe OverseasDevelopmentInstitute, a Brit-ish think-tank. The world is1°Cwarmerthan in pre-industrial times, and countriesfeelingrelated eﬀectsknowtheyneed tonegotiate, with orwithoutadditional in-centives.

Poli-cywonksbelieve itcould also bearAmeri-ca’swithdrawal. Butsuch a radical changeofdirection would send a terrible signal.The presidentonce called global warminga“hoax”, then more recentlyacknowl-edged “some connectivity” between hu-man activityand climate change.

On March 19th JeﬀJones,the company’spresident, stepped downaftersixmonths, declaringthat“the beliefsand approach to leadership thathave guid-ed mycareerare inconsistentwith what Isawand experienced atUber.” Atleastsixkeyexecutivesand high-rankingemploy-eeshave leftin the pastnine weeks.

He pushed into newmar-ketsabroad and raised an unprecedentedamountofcapital, to the tune ofaround$12.5bn, includingdebt. The ﬁrm hasa val-uation ofclose to $70bn (see chart). Yeta remarkable run ofbad newsforMrKalanick, combined with some set-backsforUberitself, threatensto halt theﬁrm’smomentum. “I have neverseensomeone have such a bad couple ofmonths,” commiseratesthe bossofa large,wasthe revelation thatUberhad secretlydesigned and used a software feature,called Greyball, to evade cityoﬃcials at-temptingstingoperationsto catch Uberdriversviolatinglocal regulations. Two questionsface the company. One iswhetherUberwill continue prosperingunderMrKalanick’sleadership. SiliconValleyand itsdenizensmaycelebrate histype, buthispublicwordsand actionshave made people close to the ﬁrm squirm.Bill Gurley, a venture capitalistand earlyUberbackerwho sitson the board, is help-ingdirecta search fora chiefoperating oﬃ-certo keep MrKalanickin checkand bringexperience and discipline to the ﬁrm. Itiscertainlyhard to keep on top ofthe ﬁrm’sgrowth: lastyear, itsheadcountdoubled. IfMrGurleyand the restofthe boardcannotﬁnd an experienced candidate will-ingto workwith MrKalanick, callsfor himto step down maygrowlouder. Butthat ishisdecision to take. Uberisa prominent ex-ample offounders’ poweratfast-growingtech ﬁrms. On itsown, Uber’sboard doesnothave the cloutto change the CEO, be-cause ofhissuper-votingsharesand thoseofhisco-founder, GarrettCamp: togethertheycontrol a majorityofthe voting stock. The second question concernsUber’slonger-term businessprospects. One of theﬁrm’searly-stage investorssaysthat recenteventshave been a seriesof“bodyblows”,buthe worriesthatthere could be a“knockoutblow” thatwould permanentlydamage Uber’smomentum. So far, he says,itlooksasifUberismerelybruised. From the startofthe yearto the ﬁrstweekin March, Uber’smarketshare inAmerica hasfallen from around 80% to74%, accordingto 7ParkData, which tracksthe industry. Lyft, a smallerride-hailingﬁrm, seemsto have been the chiefbeneﬁ-ciary. The dip in marketshare forUbercould reverse, though the ﬁrm isunlikely topublictech ﬁrm. Politicsstruckﬁrst: in Jan-uaryMrKalanickwaswidelycriticised forservingon Donald Trump’sbusiness-advisorycommittee and forapparently in-terveningin a strike bytaxi drivers op-posed to MrTrump’sban on refugees. Acampaign, called #DeleteUber, tookoﬀ, en-couragingusersto stop usingthe Uber app. Then worriesaboutUber’sculturemounted. Aformeremployee wrote a blogposton howUber’shuman-resourcesde-partmentfailed to acton hersexual-harass-mentcomplaint.

Lastweekan American courtupheld a lawfrom Seattle allowingUberdriversa vote to unionise. Othercities areexpected to followsuit. ABritish court willsoon need to rule on whetherUberhas topayvalue-added tax.AsforUber’srace to move awayfromhuman driversto autonomousdriving, ob-stacleslie ahead. In FebruaryWaymo, aself-drivingcarunitthatisowned by Goo-gle’sparentcompany, sued Uber, claimingthatformeremployeesofGoogle had sto-len some ofWaymo’sproprietarytechnol-ogywhen theysetup theirown autono-mous-drivingstartup, Otto. Lastyear UberboughtOtto, which makesself-driving kitforlorries, foraround $700m. Patentdisputesare common in the techindustryand can take yearsto playout, butWaymo isbeingparticularlyaggressive. Ithasasked a judge to ban Uber’suse ofits li-dartechnology, which useslasersto scan avehicle’ssurroundingsand isemployed inself-drivingcars. Ubermaysettle for a largesum, butthe aﬀairaddsuncertainty. Some people close to Uberaskwhetherall the diﬃcultieswill force MrKalanick,who hassaid he neverwantsto take theﬁrm public, to considerdoingjustthat. Itwill nowbe farharderto raise money inthe private marketsatUber’sstratosphericvaluation. Butitispossible to argue the op-posite: MrKalanickwill need the clouds ofcontroversyto clearbefore goingpublic. Hiscompany’sproblemscould occuratmanystartups, butthe factthatthey haveall struckatonce suggestsitsimmaturityand a lackofprofessional management.Given the sumsatstake and the blowtothe prestige ofmanyin Silicon Valley ifUberfailed, there will be no shortage ofpressure on MrKalanickto prove that he isthe rightperson to stayatthe wheel. 7PRESENTED in an unusually-shapedheavyglassbottle with outsized blacklettering, itcould be a ﬁne vodka.

Itisall too easytofall foul offoreign governments’ weakstomach forfood scares. 7FEWsloganswere chanted with asmuchpassion byDonald Trump’ssupportersin the presidential campaign as“Build thatwall!”. The construction industryisalmostasenthusiastic. LastweekAmerica’sCus-tomsand BorderProtection agency(CBP)issued two invitationsforcompaniestobid to build the wall on the borderwithMexico, which isexpected to costany-where between $12bn and $25bn. Thedeadline fordesignsfallson March 29th.One requestisfora solid concrete borderwall, and the otherfora wall using“alter-natives” to reinforced solid concrete, sug-gestingthe governmenthasyetto decidewhatthe barriershould be made of.More than 700 companies, from biggeneral contractorsto ﬁrmssellingmateri-alsto niche providersoflightingand sur-veillance systems, have registered to trytobecome suppliers. To the surprise ofsome,aboutone in ten ofthe ﬁrmsbidding are lo-cal oneswith Hispanicowners, drawn bythe scale ofthe earningson oﬀer. Cemex, aMexican cementgiantthathasplantsonboth sidesofthe border, said itwould notsell cementforthe project, though it hadearlierexpressed interestin joining the bid-ding. Another, tiny, Mexican ﬁrm has of-fered lighting. Otherforeign ﬁrmsmusclingin includeSAFence & Gate from South Africa andQuickfence from Spain, although theymaynotgetfar: the government’stendermentionsa “BuyAmerican” preference.Skanska, a Swedish ﬁrm thatisone of theconstruction industry’slargest, publiclysnubbed the project. “We believe in open-nessand equality,” declared itschiefexecu-tive, Johan Karlstrom. The bigAmerican bidderstryto down-playthe politics. Howard Nye, the boss ofMartin Marietta, a materialsgiantbased inNorth Carolina, sayssimplythathiscom-panyhas“a general interestin large infra-structure projects”. Itssharesand that ofotherconstruction ﬁrmshave risen as a re-sultofMrTrump’spledge to lavish $1trn oninfrastructure acrossthe country. Thoseplansmaybe delayed, butnot, itseems, thewall. Forsome smallerbidders, businessand personal viewsare aligned. MichaelMcLaughlin ofGreenﬁeld Fence, a contrac-torbased nearSan Diego, saysthe barrier isneeded to keep “dangerousdrugdealers”outofthe country. The general requirementisfora wallthatisatleast5.5 metreshigh, preferably9metres, with anti-climb and anti-tunnell-ingfeatures, and which—on the Americanside, atleast—is“aestheticallypleasing”.The fewdozen ﬁrmsthatmake itto the sec-ond round will laterpresentdetailed draw-ingsand technical speciﬁcationsaswell astheirbestprice. Atthe end ofthe process astill unknown numberofwinnerswilleach be awarded a contractwith a maxi-mum value of$300m. The rulesofthe game clearlyfavourlarge engineeringand construction ﬁrmssuch asKBR, which helped build the deten-tion camp atGuantánamo Bayand whichwill probablybid, orKiewit, from Nebras-ka. These companieshave the bestdesignexpertise, top-notch construction-manage-mentteamsand the abilityto strong-armmaterialssuppliers. Butsmallish playerscould still turn a proﬁtbysigningup to besubcontractorsto bigger, prime contrac-tors. AndrewDorfschmidtofMcDirtExca-vation, a family-owned businessin SouthDakota, hopesto sell diggingservices towhichevercompaniesare awarded thegovernmentcontract. Otherﬁrmsare notinterested in build-ingthe wall itselfbutare lookingto sell bor-der-wall accessoriesthatare known as“tactical infrastructure and technology”.These include lighting, standingplatformsand remote video-surveillance systems.One such ﬁrm, 2020 Surveillance, assumesthere will be camerasplaced every60 me-tresalongthe wall. Ata licensingfee ofafewhundred dollarspercamera peryear itwould expectto make $10m in revenue ev-eryyearthe wall isin place, ifitsuppliedsurveillance forthe whole length required,orabout1,000 miles(1,610km). Despite the strongexpression ofinter-estfrom potential bidders, the construc-tion schedule could be unpredictable. Forone thing, companybossesnote thatthewall will run through manyparcelsof priv-ate land. Although eminent-domain laws,which force the transferofprivate propertyinto publichands, maybe invoked bythegovernment, agreeingon adequate com-pensation forevicted landownersoftenbecomesa legal headache. Receivingpaymentcould also taketime. Onlya small fraction ofthe estimat-ed total costofbuildingthe wall has beenring-fenced underMrTrump’s“skinny”budgetproposal. Mexico hasdisobliginglyruled outpayingforit. Delaymaynot mat-terto everyone, however.

The oilprice mayonlybe at$48, orhalfthe level itwasthree years ago.Butshale fracking—the businessofgettingoil and gasout ofrocksbyblastingthem with waterand sand—isboomingonce againafterthe crash of2014-16. Exploration and production (E&P) com-paniesare aboutto go on an investmentspree. Demand is soaringforthe industry’srawmaterials: sand, otherpeople’smoney,roughnecksand ice-cold beer. Shale’ssecond comingistestamentto Texan grit. But the in-dustry’snever-say-die spiritmayexplain whyithasdone nexttonothingaboutitsdire ﬁnances. The businesshasburned up cashfor34 ofthe last40 quarters, accordingto ﬁgureson the top 60 list-ed E&Pﬁrmscollected byBloomberg, a data provider. With the ex-ception ofairlines, Chinese state enterprisesand Silicon Valleyunicorns—private ﬁrmsvalued atmore than $1bn—shale ﬁrmsareon an unparalleled money-losingstreak. About$11bn wastorched in the latestquarter, ascapital expendituresexceededcashﬂows. The cash-burn rate maywell rise again thisyear.Meanwhile, the prospectofrapidlyrisingproduction is rat-tlingglobal energymarkets. In particularitworriesOPEC, a cartelofproducersled bySaudi Arabia thataimsto restrain output andkeep pricesstable and fairlyhigh. Khalid al-Falih, Saudi’senergyminister, warned of“irrational exuberance” on March 7th duringan energy-industryconference in Houston.When oil priceshalved in just16 weeksstartingin late 2014,panichitTexas, followed—fora while—bygrim austerity. Thenumberofdrillingrigsin America dropped by68% from peaktotrough. Companiesslashed investment. Over100 ﬁrmswentbankrupt, defaultingon atleast$70bn ofdebt. Shale’sretrench-menthelped to stabilise the global oil price. Production in thelower48 states(ie, excludingAlaska and Hawaii), and excludingfederal watersin the GulfofMexico, hasdropped by15% overthepast21months, equivalentto 1m bpd, or1% ofglobal output.The partial recoveryin the oil price, which atone point fell aslowas$26, isonlyone factorbehind renewed enthusiasm forshale. Houston’soptimistsalso argue thatthe full geological po-tential ofTexas’sPermian basin hasonlyjustbecome apparent.Some expertsthinkitcould in time produce more barrels eachdaythan Saudi Arabia does. Thathasoﬀsetgloom about fallingproduction from othershale basins, such asthe Bakken forma-tion in western North Dakota. The industryhasalso lifted pro-ductivity. Drillingisfaster, more selective and more accurate, andleakage ratesare lower. Wellsare beingdesigned to penetratemultiple layersofoil thatare stacked on top ofeach other.Butthe factthatthe industrymakeshuge accountinglosseshasnotchanged. Ithasburned up cash whetherthe oil price wasat$100, asin 2014, oratabout$50, asitwasduringthe pastthreemonths. The biggest60 ﬁrmsin aggregate have used up $9bn perquarteron average forthe pastﬁve years. Asa result the industryhasbarelyimproved itsﬁnancesdespite raising$70bn ofequitysince 2014. Much ofthe newmoneygotswallowed up bylosses,so total debtremainshigh, atjustover$200bn.Oil bosseslike to showoﬀtheirnewestwellsin the Permianbasin, which, theysay, can nowmake internal ratesofreturn ofmore than 50% overtheirworkinglives. Butmostﬁrmshave me-diocre wellstoo, aswell ascorporate overheads, so their overalleﬃciencyimprovementhasnotbeen great. Forthe ten largest list-ed E&Pﬁrms, aggregate cash operatingcostsperbarrel fell by$13between 2014 and 2016; notenough to oﬀseta $50 drop in the oilprice. Because shale-energyﬁeldsrun outfarfasterthan tradition-al ones, ﬁrmsmustreinvestheavilyto keep production ﬂat. Itisinstructive to compare shale with anothernatural-re-sourcesbusinessthathashad to cope with a collapse in commod-ityprices. In 2016 the miningindustry’sbiggestcompaniesground outproﬁts, produced cashﬂowaftercapital investmentsand made a decentreturn on capital. Yetdespite thisunﬂatteringcontrast, capital investmentbyAmerican E&Pcompanieswillprobablysoaroverthe nextyear, byperhaps50% ormore. There are two theoriesforwhythisishappening. One isthatthe wayin which executivesare paid, togetherwith lenders’ in-centives, meansthatHouston isalwaysvulnerable to investmentmania. Notone ofthe ten biggestE&Pﬁrms, forexample, puts sig-niﬁcantemphasisin itspayscheme on howmuch return on capi-tal itproduces. Lowinterestratesmake iteasyforshale ﬁrmstoborrow, and fee-hungrybankscheeron the spectacle. But theonlywaythatthe mania will end well isifoil pricesrise sharply,bailingoutthe industry, orifE&Pﬁrmsare boughtbybiggerener-gyﬁrms. Thatispossible, butcompaniessuch asExxon and Shellare too seasoned to paya lotforsmall, unproﬁtable ﬁrms.Houston, we still have a problemThe second explanation isoil executives’ beliefin increased out-putfrom the Permian, and higherproductivity. MostE&Pﬁrmsreckon theycan expand production atan annual rate of10-20%overthe nextfewyears. Butto justifytheirmarketvalues, andmake an adequate return on theircumulative capital invested,listed E&Pﬁrmswould overtime need to make about$60bn offree cashﬂoweach year. Assumingthatboth energyprices andcapital spendingstayﬂat, thatwould require them roughly todouble production from currentlevels.The trouble isthatthisisa circularargument. Ifachievedacrossthe whole shale industryitwould mean thatoutputwould be twice ashigh asitisnow, leadingto a 5% increase in glo-bal supply, which mightin turn lowerthe oil price. There issome-thingheroic—and baﬄing—aboutAmerica’sshale ﬁrms. They arethe marginal producerin a cyclical industry, and thatis usuallyanunpleasantplace to be. The oil bullsofHouston have yet to provethattheycan pump oil and create value atthe same time.7Texas hold’emWhyshale ﬁrms don’tgive a frackaboutﬁnancial returnsSchumpeterThe EconomistMarch25th201761For daily analysis and debate on economics, visitEconomist.com/economics1THEIMF“systematicallyimpoverishesforeigners”, and the World Bank’sad-vice has“negative value to itsbestclients”.These harsh wordswere voiced notbyleftycriticsofthe Washington Consensus,butbytwo men (David Malpassand AdamLerrick, respectively) whom DonaldTrump haspicked to lead hisTreasury’sdealingswith the restofthe world, includ-ingthe international ﬁnancial institutions(IFIs), such asthe World Bankand IMF, andtheG20 group ofleadingeconomies.Theirfuture boss, Steven Mnuchin,America’streasurysecretary, isnotmuchmore reassuringto the global ﬁnancial es-tablishment. AthisﬁrstG20 meeting, inBaden-Baden in Germanyon March17th-18th (pictured), he vetoed a long-stand-ingpledge to “resistall formsofprotection-ism”. Ithad often been breached. But hy-pocrisyisthe tribute vice paysto virtue.To veteransofinternational economicaﬀairs, thiscombative stance isbaﬄing.America’sgovernmentnowseemsto dis-dain a setofinstitutionsitnurtured intolife—institutionsthatare more commonlycriticised forfollowingAmerica’swill tooclosely. “The United Statesisjusthandingthe leadership overto China ofthe multi-lateral system,” JeﬀreySachsofColumbiaUniversitytold Bloombergthisweek. Butifthere isa vacancy, isChina quali-ﬁed oreven interested in the job? In Janu-aryPresidentXi Jinpingseemed to audi-ward friendsand secure contractsfor itscompanies. Over60 countrieswill, for ex-ample, supposedlybeneﬁtfrom MrXi’snostalgicvision ofa revived SilkRoad (the“SilkRoad EconomicBeltand 21stCenturyMaritime SilkRoad”, mercifullyshortenedto “One Belt, One Road”, orOBOR). Asformultilateral eﬀorts, China’smosteye-catchinginitiativeshave workedaround the existingsystem, notthrough it.Itsetup two multilateral lendersof itsown, the NewDevelopmentBank(knownasthe BRICSbank, based in Shanghai, withﬁnancial contributionsfrom Brazil, Russia,India and South Africa aswell asitself),and the Asian Infrastructure InvestmentBank(AIIB), in Beijing, which justin-creased itsmembership to 70, includingev-eryG7 countryexceptJapan and America. So itmightseem thatChina haslittle in-terestin ﬁllinganygapsAmerica mightleave in the old multilateral system. Butthatwould ignore another, lessheraldedtrend. Overshadowed byitsbilateral boon-dogglesand multilateral innovations, Chi-na’srelationship with the incumbentIFIshasbeen warming. Ithasbecome more“compliant” with G20 commitments, ac-cordingto the G20 Research Group attheUniversityofToronto (see chart). Its cur-rencyisnowmore fairlyvalued and its cur-rent-accountsurplushasnarrowed, re-movinga bone ofcontention with the IMF. The IMF’sdecision in 2015 to include theyuan asone ofﬁve reserve currencies in itsSpecial DrawingRightsbaskethasalsohelped to rebutthe notion thatthe fund isan arm ofan American policyofcontain-ment. Moreover, since China’sham-ﬁsteddevaluation earlierthatyear, ithas oftensoughtthe IMF’sadvice on managingthetransition to a more ﬂexible yuan and com-municatingitspolicyto the markets.China issimilarlyhappyto learn whattion forthe role in a speech praisingglobalisation atthe World EconomicFo-rum in Davos, Switzerland.

Butbyaddingex-tra dollopsofﬁnancingto favoured bankand fund programmes, China can none-thelesssteerthe multilateral system indi-rectly, byaddingitsweightwhere it seesﬁt.In the longterm, ifChina becomes theworld’sleadingeconomy, itisconceivableitwill become the biggestﬁnancial contrib-utorto the bankand the fund. Atthat point,accordingto theirarticlesofagreement,theirheadquarterswould have to decampto China. All the more reason forthe WorldBankto help Beijingclean itsair. 7AMERICAmaybe the world’slargesteconomy, butthese daysitsgovern-mentpaysmore than manyothersto bor-rowmoney. Itsten-yearbond yields arehigherthan those in Britain, France, Singa-pore and even Italy. The gap between American and Ger-man ten-yearyieldshasbeen above twopercentage points. Formuch ofthe past 25years, itwasveryrare forthe diﬀerence toexceed a single percentage point. On occa-sions, American yieldsfell belowGer-man levels(see chart). Go backa generation and youmighthave expected the countrywith the high-erbond yieldsto be the one with theweakercurrency; investorswould de-mand a higheryield to compensate forthe riskoffuture depreciation. But thatisnotthe case today. The dollarhasbeenstrong, relative to the euro, and many peo-ple expectitto strengthen further. Indeed,the higheryield on American govern-mentdebtisone reason whyinvestorsmightwantto buythe dollar.Instead, the gap mayreﬂectdiﬀerencesin both monetaryand ﬁscal policy. InAmerica the Federal Reserve stoppedbuyingTreasurybondsa while ago andhasraised interestratesthree times sinceDecember2015; the European CentralBank(ECB) isstill buyingbondsaspart ofits“quantitative easing” programme, andpaysa negative rate on deposits. TheTrump administration iscommitted to taxcutsand infrastructure spendingthatwould increase the budgetdeﬁcitand re-quire more bond issuance. The euro zonehasno plansofthissortforﬁscal stimulus. The presentdivergence recallsthat be-tween American and Japanese bondyields. The latterhave been consistentlylowformuch ofthe past20 years, astheJapanese economybecame mired in slowgrowth and deﬂation. Perhapsinvestorsexpectthe euro zone to getstuckin a deﬂa-tionaryquicksand asthe American econ-omyreturnsto more robustgrowth.Butthatviewdoesnotshowup in inﬂa-tion expectations. An oft-used measure,derived from the bond market, isknown asthe “ﬁve year/ﬁve-yearforward rate”. Atthe momentthisgauge isshowingthe mar-ketforecastforthe average inﬂation rate in2022-27. In America the forecastisaround2.1%; in the euro zone itisaround 1.7%. Sixmonthsago the forecastswere 1.68% and1.34%. Both have risen a little, butthe gaphasnotwidened signiﬁcantly.So more maybe goingon than simpleeconomics. Politics, perhaps. The Frenchpresidential election isapproachingandMarine Le Pen, the far-rightcandidate, hastalked aboutredenominatingFrench gov-ernmentbondsin francsinstead ofeuros.Thatwould lead to biglossesforinterna-tional investors. Although fewpeoplethinkMsLe Pen will actuallybecome presi-dent, investorshave been burned bylastyear’svotingupsets. So there hasbeen atendencyto optforthe safestbondsin theeuro zone—those issued bythe Germangovernment. The spread between Frenchand German ten-yearyieldsismore thandouble itslevel on October28th. Anotherfactormaybe the actions ofinstitutional investors. In a recent speechHyun SongShin ofthe BankforInterna-tional Settlements(BIS), an organisationofcentral banks, pointed outthatbothlife-insurance companiesand pensionfundstend to have long-dated liabilities,ie, claimstheymustmeetovermany de-cades. Theytryto match those liabilitiesbybuyinggovernmentbonds. Account-ingand regulatoryrulesoften requirethem to use long-dated bond yieldsto cal-culate theirliabilities.Butthere isa mismatch: the liabilitiesofthese companiesand fundstend to belonger-dated than the bondstheyhold. Sowhen long-dated bond yieldsfall, their ﬁ-nancial position deteriorates. That meanstheyneed to buymore bonds. Thisdrivespricesup—and yieldsfurtherdown, mak-ingthe problem even worse. The BISsayseuro-zone insurance companiesaccount-ed for40% ofthe netpurchasesofthe re-gion’sgovernment’sbondsin 2014.

Politicalworriesmaysubside ifMsLe Pen doesn’twin; the ECBmayscale backitsmonetaryeasing; MrTrump’sstimulusplansmaybe delayed, orwatered down.

Anumberofsecurityprotocolsneed to be metbefore the SWIFTsystem authorisesa payment: one step, aphysical keyordongle, wasleftplugged inforweeks, ratherthan locked away. Five ofthe hackers’ 70 messageswere accepted asgenuine bythe NewYorkFed. Butforbasicslip-ups(some paymentinstructions, forexample, were incomplete) the thievescould have made oﬀwith $1bn. SWIFThasnotcommented on the in-vestigation. LastyearGottfried Leibbrandt,itschiefexecutive, tookpainsto stress thatitwasthe bank’ssecurity, and notSWIFT’s,thathad been compromised. Investigatorshave been silentin publicon the role ofBangladeshi nationalsin the crime. Reluc-tance to expose failingsathome mayhelpexplain whytheirﬁndingshave yetto bepublished. The oﬃcial line isthatthey donotwantto jeopardise ongoinginquiries. Bangladesh hasrecovered only$15m ofthe $81m wired to the Philippines. (Pay-mentsmade to Sri Lanka were reversed be-fore theycould be withdrawn.) The mainplottershave yetto be traced. Noris thereevidence thatanymoneyreached NorthKorea. Butrelationsbetween Bangladeshand North Korea have soured: lastAugust aNorth Korean diplomatwasexpelled fromDhaka on suspicion ofsmuggling. Whetherin connection with the heistornot, SWIFThasin eﬀectcutoﬀNorth Ko-rea’sformal tieswith the global ﬁnancialsystem.

TheFTAsare in anycase with countriesrepre-sentingjusttwo-ﬁfthsofAmerica’stwo-waytrade in goods, and lessthan 10% ofitsgoods-trade deﬁcit(see chart).

ButMrTrump seemsunlikely toattackthatFTA, America’soldest. Areviewoftrade dealsishardly revo-lutionary. More recentones, like KORUS,have committeesdedicated to monitor-ingthem. And both the Mexican and theCanadian governmentshave acceptedthatNAFTAshould be updated forthingslike e-commerce. Theysawthe Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership, agreed to in 2016 bythe NAFTAthree and nine otherPaciﬁcRim countries(and jettisoned byMrTrump), aspartofthatprocess.Lastyeargeeksatthe United StatesInternational Trade Commission (USITC)published a 373-page, evidence-basedassessmentofAmerica’strade deals.

Also, the USITCestimatesthateach ofAmerica’stradedealshastended to improve the bilateraltrade balance. WithoutNAFTA, the USITCestimatesthatthe goodsdeﬁcitswithCanada and Mexico would be largerbyaround 3% oftotal bilateral trade. Tradedealstend to slash othercountries’ tariﬀsmore than American ones.

Customersneedbarelyeverinteractwith theirbank. To date, despite dire warnings, Euro-pean retail bankinghasbeen remarkablyunscathed bytechnology-driven disrup-tion.

Buttheirreach is morelimited elsewhere in Europe. Physical pay-mentsare still overwhelminglymade withcash orbankcards. One reason incumbentshave provedso resilientisthatﬁntech ﬁrmslack the cus-tomer-transaction information theyneedto provide manyﬁnancial services. Bankscan be slowto respond to requestsfor ac-cessto such data, ormayblockthem alto-getherforsecurityreasons. Itisoften eithercumbersome orinsecure forcustomerstoshare theirown information. Banks, on theotherhand, have easyaccessto transactiondata, which theycan use to sell their cus-tomersotherservices. Regulators, however, are aboutto trans-form the landscape. The PaymentsSer-vicesDirective 2 (PSD2), due to be imple-mented byEUmembersin January2018,aimsto kick-startcompetition while mak-ingpaymentsmore secure. Provided thecustomerhasgiven explicitconsent, bankswill be forced to share customer-accountinformation with licensed ﬁnancial-ser-vicesproviders. Thisshould change the waypaymentserviceswork.

ScepticssayitisnotclearwhetherDAFsactuallyincrease the amountofmoneythatreachesthe needy, and that thetaxbreaksassociated with them mainlybeneﬁtthe rich. Moreover, opacityleavesDAFsopen to abuse. One long-held con-cern isthattheyare used to sidestep rulesrequiringfoundationsto make annual do-nationsto charities. AnalysisbyThe Econo-mistshowsthisisindeed happening.Theirexplosive growth isrecent, butDAFsdate from the 1930s. Theywere ﬁrstused bycommunityfoundationsto en-courage local philanthropyaswell as bysingle-issue non-proﬁts, such asmuseums.Butitwasn’tuntil 1969, when newreport-ingrulestooksome ofthe shine oﬀfoun-dations, thatDAFsﬂourished. In 1991, ap-proved bythe IRS, FidelityCharitable, anon-proﬁtlinked to the mutual-fundgroup, wassetup to oﬀerDAFsto clients,becomingthe ﬁrstcommercial provider.By2000 manyotherﬁnancial ﬁrmswere peddlingsuch funds, includingSchwab and Vanguard, both nowDAFgiants. The industryhassince ballooned:from about180,000 American DAFsin2010 to over270,000 in 2015, easilyout-numberingfoundations. The assetsheld inDAFsdoubled in value in thattime, toroughly$80bn. LastyearFidelityCharita-ble overtookUnited Way, a traditionalnon-proﬁtorganisation, to become Ameri-ca’sbiggestcharitybydonationsfrom thepublic(see chart).Manyprovidershave seen a furthersurge in donationsoflate, sparked in partbyfearsthatthe Trump administrationmayreduce philanthropictaxbreaks. Be-tween November2016 and January2017,Schwab sawa 68% increase in inﬂowscompared with the same period in the pre-viousyear. Othersalso reporta biguptick.Even ifmore moneyisﬂowingintoDAFs, itwill notnecessarilyreach theneedyassoon asitcomesout. The Econo-mistcrunched the latest12 months-worthofavailable data on the donationsmadebythe three biggestDAFproviders—theyearendingJune 2016 forVanguard andthe yearendingJune 2015 forFidelityandSchwab (Vanguard and Schwab excludedonationsunder$5,000 from the data).Manypaymentswentto worthycausessuch asMédecinsSansFrontièresand theRed Cross.

Moreover, aswith givingdirectto charity, the taxbeneﬁtscan be booked inthe yearofthe donation, even though theultimate beneﬁciarymaynotyethavebeen chosen. In a surveybyFidelityin2015, 90% ofdonorsnamed thisasthemain reason forstartinga DAF.Anotheradvantage isthatcommercialsuppliersofDAFsacceptnotonlycashbut—unlike mostnon-proﬁts—illiquid gifts,such asartorland. Once a providerre-ceivesthe asset, itwill tryto sell itand cred-itthe proceedsto the donor’sDAF. Non-publiclytraded companyshares, whichhave risen in value, are anothercommongift: the taxdeduction istaken atthe cur-rentmarketvalue—a beneﬁtnotaﬀordedgiftsto foundations. In 2013 around 28% ofdonationsto DAFswere non-cash. Moreover, whereastaxlawsrequirefoundationsto give outatleast5% oftheirassetseach year,DAFsface no such condi-tion. So donorshave more time to weightheiroptions. DAFsare easyto use, too. In-ternet-banking-style platformsallowgrantsto be made with justa fewmouse-clicks. Set-up costsare a fraction of those offoundations, withoutthe need to hire law-yersorﬁll in reamsofpaperwork. FansofDAFsargue thatthisconve-nience spursphilanthropy. Accordingto Fi-delity, two-thirdsofitsdonorssaythe vehi-cle helpsthem give more; othercomm-ercial supplierscite similarﬁgures. Thisdoesnotshowup in the national statistics,however. RayMadoﬀ, a taxexpertatBos-ton College, pointsoutthatthe share ofmoneygoingto charitiesin America hasnotbudged in the pastdecade, atroughly2% ofdisposable netincome (though ofcourse, since DAFsstill accountforlessthan a tenth oftotal giving, manyother fac-torscould playa role in this).Weighingup the prosand consismadeharderbya scarcityofdata. Numbers forindividual accountsare notpublished—soitisimpossible to knowwhether, for in-stance, thousandsofdonors, havingcol-lected theirtaxbeneﬁts, are sitting on theirassetsratherthan distributingthem. Give and you shall receiveThe onlypubliclyavailable numbersareaggregatesfrom DAFproviders. These sug-gestthateach yeararound 20% ofassetsheld bythem go to good causes. Thisismuch higherthan the rate ofroughly7%seen atfoundations. Butthiscomparison ismisleading. Forone thing, foundations, un-like mostDAFs, are setup in perpetuity andthustend to ration theirgrants. For anoth-er, DAFpayoutsare highlyuneven: in a giv-en yeararound one-ﬁfth ofproviders fail tomake a single grant, and, asnoted, someoutgoingsare to otherDAFs. Furthermore,payoutrates—the proportion oftotal assetsleavingDAFs—are falling. Fidelity’sannualpayoutrate dropped from 21% to 16% be-tween 2008 and 2014, the latestyearofavailable data. Those ofSchwab and Van-guard fell from 18% to around 11%.Detractorsargue thatwarped incen-tivescurb giving. Providersproﬁtfrom hav-ingmore assetsundertheirmanagementand invested in theirown funds. Theytherefore stand to gain from dissuading do-nors—who have alreadyclaimed theirtaxdeductions—from makingpaymentsoutoftheirDAF. And, because the moneysittingin a DAFgrowsfrom the investmentin-come, donorsare furtherdeterred frompassingiton quicklyto a good cause. (Totheircredit, however, the biggerDAFsup-pliersdo have policiesin place to distributeatleastsome ofthe moneyin dormant ac-counts. Ifan accountatFidelityhas beenidle forthree years, itwill give the holderanudge. Ifthe inactivitycontinues, Fidelitystartsto make small grantson hisbehalf.)Anotherconcern isthatsome funds areused notto give butto game: forinstance,to sidestep the 5%-minimum rule on foun-dation payouts. Donorscan shiftmoneyfrom theirfoundation to a DAF asa wayofmeetingthisthreshold withoutactuallygivinganythingto charity. The Economistexamined grantsfrom a random sample ofabout4,000 foundations. Some 40 ofthem routed cash to the biggestDAFpro-viders, amountingto about1% ofthe valueofall theircontributions. Thismayseemlike a negligible sum, but11ofthe 40 gaveover90% ofthe moneytheypaid outtoDAFsuppliers. Thisisnotillegal, but itdoesappearto ﬂoutthe spiritofthe tax code.The IRShasgrown wise to some oftheproblems. Adecade ago itwasincludingDAFson its“dirtydozen” listofthe mostworryingtaxscams. Anotherconcern wasself-dealing: in one case in 2006, a Califor-nia-based DAFproviderhad boasted in itsearliermarketingmaterialsthatsetting upan accountcould “beneﬁtthe donororthedonor’sfamily” and thatthe donor’schil-dren could be paid orgranted fellowshipsdirectfrom a DAF. Thatsame year, DAFswere ﬁrstdeﬁned in the taxcode. Certainruses, such asusingthem to buytickets tocharitable eventsorgrantoneselflow-costloans, were laterprohibited. Although such shenanigansare harderto pull oﬀ, there are still opportunities,mainlyatsmallerDAF-providers, saysRog-erColinvauxofColumbusSchool ofLaw.Akeen fraudstercould setup a small non-proﬁt, staﬀithimself, channel money intoaDAF, claim the taxbreaks, redirect themoneybackto the non-proﬁtand draw afat, tax-advantaged salary.Charitybegins athomeAnotherworryisthe use ofDAFsto cir-cumventthe “public-supporttest”. Thisrule stipulatesthata charitytypically mustreceive the lion’sshare ofitsrevenue fromthe general public. Othersare classiﬁed asfoundations. Acreative donorcould do-nate to a charitythrough numerousDAFs,givingthe false impression ofwidespreadpublicsupport. Lastyear, the IRSan-nounced an investigation into this.Butthe agencyisstretched forre-sources, and expertssayitstruggles to keepon top oftrickery. Anotherworryisthe useofDAFsto convertilliquid assets, such aspropertyorhard-to-price securities, intocharitable dollars. Some fearthe valuationsystem isopen to abuse. Donors, who arekeen to getthe bestprice and maximise taxdeductions, typicallyhire a third party todo the valuation. Monitoringthisprocessistime-consumingand costly, and thusrarelycarried out. Astudybythe TreasuryInspectorGeneral forTaxAdministration,an American watchdog, looked ata sam-ple ofnon-cash giftsto charitiesin 2010. Itfound thataround 60% ofreturnsdid notmeetreportingrequirementsand none ofthese had been examined bythe IRS.Moreover, DAFsare frequentlyused tofunnel moneyto political campaignsandlobbygroups, ratherthan whatmostpeo-ple would considergood causes. Donors tosuch groupscan also exploitthe funds’murkynature to hide theiridentity. OnestudybyRobertBrulle ofDrexel Universi-ty, in Philadelphia, tracked contributions tothe anti-climate-change lobbyin America.He found thatin 2009 and 2010 aboutaquarterofitsbackingwhich could betraced came via the DonorsTrust, a Virgin-ia-based DAFsupplier. There isno way oftellingwhere thismoneyoriginated.FansofDAFsargue thatsuch cases areexceptions, and thatmostoftheirmoneygoesto uncontroversial good causes. Manygive generouslyand sincerely. Butcon-cernswill lingerthatDAFsallowthe rich toreap ﬁnancial beneﬁtsfrom ﬁnancing petcausestheymightwell have backed any-way—and thatmore advantagesaccrue todonorsthan to the causestheyare sup-posed to be helping. Atpresent, there isscantevidence to suggesttheyfuel an over-all rise in giving. Manyphilanthropists singDAFs’ praises. Butthatdoesnotprove theirworth to societyasa whole. 7Pile-upSources: IRS; National Philanthropic TrustUnited States, donor-advised funds, $bn051015202520060810121415OutflowsInflows68FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistMarch25th2017AMERICANworkerswithoutcollege degreeshave suﬀered ﬁ-nanciallyfordecades—ashasbeen known fordecades. Morerecentisthe discoverythattheirwoesmightbe deadly. In 2015Anne Case and AngusDeaton, two (married) scholars, reportedthatin the 20 yearsto 1998, the mortalityrate ofmiddle-agedwhite Americansfell byabout2% a year. Butbetween 1999 and2013, deathsrose. The reversal wasall the more striking because,in Europe, overall middle-agemortalitycontinued to fall atthesame 2% pace. By2013 middle-aged white Americanswere dyingattwice the rate ofsimilarlyaged Swedesofall races (see chart).Suicide, drugoverdosesand alcohol abuse were to blame.MsCase and MrDeaton have nowupdated theirworkonthese so-called “deathsofdespair”. The results, presented thisweekatthe BrookingsInstitution, a think-tank, are no happier.White middle-age mortalitycontinued to rise in 2014 and 2015,contributingto a fall in life expectancyamongthe population asawhole. The trend transcendsgeography. Itisfound in almost ev-erystate, and in both citiesand rural areas. The problem seemstobe gettingworse overtime. Deathsfrom drugs, suicide and alco-hol have risen in everyﬁve-yearcohortofwhitesborn since the1940s. And in each group, ageingseemsto have worse eﬀects.Youmightthinkthatrisingmortalityisthe ﬂipside offallingin-comes.

Butsplitpeople outbyeducation,and the reﬂection fades. The income ofcollege graduates hasfol-lowed a similarpattern (mostofthe surge in the value ofa collegeeducation happened before 1990). Buttheirmortalityhassteadi-lyfallen. And deathsofdespairare much rareramongblacks andHispanics, whose incomeshave been on similarpaths.The authorssuspectmore amorphous, long-term forcesare atwork. The fundamental cause isstill a familiartale of economicmalaise: trade and technological progresshave snuﬀed out op-portunitiesforthe low-skilled, especiallyin manufacturing. Butsocial changesare also in play. Aseconomiclife hasbecome lesssecure, low-skilled white men have tended towardsunstable co-habitingrelationshipsratherthan marriages. Theyhave aban-doned traditional communal religion in favourofchurches thatemphasise personal identity. And theyhave become more likelyto stop working, orlookingforwork, entirely. The breakdown offamily, communityand clearstructuresoflife, in favour ofindi-vidual choice, hasliberated manybutleftotherswho fail blam-ingthemselvesand feelinghelplessand desperate.Whyare whitesthe worstaﬀected? The authorsspeculate thattheirmiseryﬂowsfrom theircrushed aspirations. Blacks and His-panicsface worse economiccircumstances, butmayhave hadlowerexpectationsto begin with. Ortheymayhave taken hopefrom progressagainstdiscrimination. Low-skilled whites, bycon-trast, mayﬁnd manyaspectsoftheirlivesperennially disappoint-ing. Thatmaypush them towardsdepression, drugsand alcohol.American exceptionalismThe theory, however, doesnotexplain whymisfortune is so le-thal in America. Itishardlythe onlyplace where manufacturingjobshave disappeared and the social fabrichasfrayed. In otherEnglish-speakingcountries—Australia, Britain, Canada and Ire-land—deathsofdespairhave risen, butnotbyasmuch. More re-search isneeded to ﬁnd outpreciselywhatisgoingon. Butitis nothard to see waysin which Americansare particularlyvulnerable.One example isthe easyavailabilityofopioid painkillers.Deathsfrom opioidsmore than doubled between 2002 and 2015.The epidemicisprimarilyfound in North America.Anotherisac-cessto guns, which are used in around halfofsuicides. However,although both these factorsprobablyincrease deaths, they can-notfullyexplain them. Alcohol, which killsmanyofthose whodespair, isreadilyavailable acrossthe West.Amore likelyrootcause fordespairisthe absence of a safetynetforswathesofAmericans, particularlyin health care. BeforeObamacare ﬁnanced an expansion ofMedicaid (government-provided health insurance forthe poor), fewstatesprovided anycoverage atall foradultswithoutdependentchildren. (Today, ofthe 19 statesthatdid notexpand Medicaid, onlyWisconsin coversanychildlessadults.) Alackofhealth insurance hasobvious im-plicationsformortalitywhen illnessstrikes. Butitcauses thehealthyanguish, too. Arandomised trial in Oregon found thatMedicaid reducesdepression ratesbya third; researchers havefound more personal ﬁnancial strain in statesthatdid notexpandthe programme. In otherrich countries, people in dire straits neednotworryaboutpayingforhealth care. Broadersocial insurance isalso lacking. The help available forworkerswho lose theirjobsispaltrycompared with their life-time income losses. Asa percentage ofGDP, America spendsonlyone-ﬁfth ofthe average in the OECD, a club ofmostlyrich coun-tries, on trainingworkers. Itspendsonlya quarterof the averageon ﬁnancial help forthe jobless. YetAmericansdo not seem tobuild theirown safetynets: 46% saytheycould notcoveran unex-pected $400 expense and would have to sell somethingorbor-rowto payforit. Aperilouseconomicexistence and a culturewhich almostindiscriminatelyholdspeople responsible for theircircumstancesare toxicformental well-being.Life isunlikelyto become more secure forthe low-skilled. Infact, policymaysoon make itmore perilous. The health-care billthatlawmakerswere due to vote on asThe Economistwenttopresswould vastlyincrease costsforthe older, poorer peoplewho are suﬀeringthe most. One avenue forreducingdespair maylie in future generationsoflow-skilled Americanscurbing theiraspirations. Indeed, some ofthe joblessyoungalreadyseem con-tentto spend much oftheirleisure time playingvideo games. ButAmerica can surelydo betterthan to hope forlesshope. 7Deaths ofdespairDesperate timesSource: “Rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans inthe 21st century”, by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, 2015Deaths per 100,000 peopleAged between 45 and 54 years (adjusted for ageing within age bracket)01002003004005001990952000051015AustraliaCanadaFranceGermanySwedenBritainUnited StatesWhite non-HispanicsEconomicshocks are more likelyto be lethal in AmericaFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchangeThe EconomistMarch25th201769For daily analysis and debate on science andtechnology, visitEconomist.com/science1ONJANUARY1stthe Bill & MelindaGatesFoundation did somethingthatmayhelp to change the practice ofscience.Itbroughtinto force a policy, foreshad-owed two yearsearlier, thatresearch itsup-ports(itisthe world’sbiggestsource ofcharitable moneyforscientiﬁcendeav-ours, to the tune ofsome $4bn a year)must, when published, be freelyavailableto all. On March 23rd itfollowed thisup byannouncingthatitwill paythe costof put-tingsuch research in one particularreposi-toryoffreelyavailable papers.To a layman, thismaysound neithercontroversial norground-breaking. But thecrucial word is“freely”. Itmeanspapers re-portingGates-sponsored research cannotbe charged for. No paywalls. No journalsubscriptions. Thatisnota newidea, butthe foundation’sannouncementgivesitteeth. ItmeansrecipientsofGates’ largessecan no longeroﬀertheirwaresto journalssuch asNature, the NewEngland Journal ofMedicineorthe Proceedingsofthe NationalAcademyofSciences, since readingthe con-tentsofthese publicationscostsmoney. Thatwill hurt. Publication in such Pre-mier-league journalsisthe stuﬀcareers arebuilton. Butitwill also hurtthe journalsthemselves.

Thatkeepsothersin the ﬁeldin the darkaboutnewresultsforlongerthan isreallynecessary, and thusslowsdown the progressofscience. Third,though thisislesseasyto prove, many re-searcherssuspectthatanonymouspeer re-viewissometimesexploited byrivals todelaythe publication ofcompetitors’ pa-pers, or, conversely, thatcabalsofmatesscratch each others’ backs, review-wise.To these criticisms, anothermaybeadded, which isnotthe faultofjournals,butstill needsaddressing. Thisisthe un-willingnessofmanyresearchersto publishthe data on which theirconclusionsarebased. Some journalsdo insiston full dis-closure ofdata, butnotall are so particular.And, even then, the data in question willnotsee the lightuntil publication day.Partial solutionsto some ofthese pro-blemshave been tried. The Gatesfounda-tion isexperimentingwith carrots, as wellassticks. Ithasoﬀered the publishers ofone top-ﬂightjournal, Science, $100,000 tomake paperspublished thisyearaboutGates-sponsored research free to read fromthe beginning. Ifthisgoeswell, the experi-mentmaybe extended to otherpublica-tions. Similarly, there isa movementamongsome publishersto make papersfree to the readerbychargingthe authors(and therefore, ultimately, theirpatrons)forthe costsofpublication—usuallyin therange of$2,000-$3,000 perpaper. Butmanynowthinkthese are half-measures,and thata real revolution in the idea ofsci-entiﬁcpublishingisneeded.Partofscience hasalreadyundergonesuch a revolution. Since 1991physicistshave been able to depositearlyversions ofence followsuit, those journals’ business-escould begin to crumble. Moreover, byactivelydirectingthe beneﬁciariesof itspatronage towardsthe repositoryin ques-tion, setup lastyearbythe Wellcome Trust(afterGates, the world’ssecond-largestmedical-research charity), the foundationispointingto a speciﬁctype ofalternative—and to a future forscientiﬁcpublicationthat, ifnotcompletelyjournal-free, islikelyto be atleast, “journal-lite”.Wellcome to the 21stcenturyPeriodical journalshave been the princi-ple meansofdisseminatingscience sincethe 17th century.

Itreceivesvirtuallyno rainfall and the littlewateritdoeshostiscontained in pondsboth acidicand salty. Ittherefore has no ve-getation. Itis, though, the site ofsome ofthe mostextraordinaryduneson Earth. Mostdunesare made ofsand: grains ofsilica thatare 2mm across, orless. There areexceptions. The White SandsNationalMonumentin NewMexico, forexample, isso called because the ingredientsofitsdunesare sand-grain-sized crystalsof gyp-sum. Butthisexception provesthe rule, be-cause the pointabouta dune isthatit iscreated bythe wind, and when itcomes tominerals, the wind can generallypick upand move around onlysand-sized objects.The dunesofSalarde Gorbea, however,are an exception thatprovesno rule at all.They, too, are white, because theyare alsomade ofgypsum. Butthe gypsum in ques-tion includescrystalsmore than 20cmlong. Howsuch dunescould form bywindaction haslongbeen a mystery. KathleenBenison, ofWestVirginia University,thinks, however, thatshe hassolved it.Gypsum isa form ofcalcium sulphatecreated bythe evaporation ofwaterladenwith thatsubstance. DrBenison knewthatgypsum crystalsofthe size found in Salarde Gorbea’sdunesform in ponds5kmfrom those dunes. She thussuspected thatthese pondsare the source ofthe dunes’crystals. Thissuspicion wasreinforced, sheexplainsin a paperjustpublished in Geolo-gy, when she compared the internal bandsmarkingstagesofthe growth ofcrystalsfrom the duneswith those ofcrystals fromthe ponds. Theyappeared identical. Thatsuggested crystalsare somehowbeingtransported from the pondsto the dunes.She wasable to rule outone mecha-nism forsuch transport—thatthe crystalshad been moved bylong-vanishedstreamsorrivers—forseveral reasons. First,the Atacama isbelieved to have been toodryforstreamsto form formillionsofyears. Second, gypsum dissolvesin water(thisis, indeed, the reason dunesmade ofitare rare, formostdesertshave atleast somerainfall). And third, the facesofcrystalsfrom the duneswere scored in wayswhichindicated thattheyhad been bashedaround bystrongwinds. The onlyinland windsobviouslypow-erful enough to have done thisare in thefunnelsoftornadoes. The Atacama desertdoesnot, though, experience such storms.Itdoesexperience lesserwhirlwinds,called dustdevils. Butthe textbooks saythatdustdevilsare notpowerful enough toliftand carryobjectsthe size ofthe crystalsfound in the dunes.Textbooks, however, are notalways cor-rect, so DrBenison decided to checkforherself. She wentto Salarde Gorbea andmonitored the dustdevilsthere. She foundthatdevilsdo regularlyform in valleysalongthe edge ofthe region. Some thenpassoverthe pondswhere the gypsumcrystalsare growing, pluckcrystalsout ofthose ponds, carrythem the 5km to thedunes, and then dissipate, droppingtheirloadson the accumulatingheaps. Whatshe doesnotyetknowishowtheydo it, forthe textbooksare, in onesense, correct. The mostpowerful recordeddustdevilshave wind speedsof70kph.Thisisindeed insuﬃcientto carrymineralparticlesbiggerthan 2mm across. ForthedevilsofSalarde Gorbea to be transport-inglarge gypsum crystalstheymustbe farmore powerful than that. DrBenisonseemstherefore to have substituted onemysteryforanother. The devilsclearly areresponsible forSalarde Gorbea’sdunes.Whatisresponsible forthese devils’ greatpowersremainsto be found out.7GeologyThe devils and thedetailsPowerful whirlwinds explain a strangefeature ofthe Atacama desertCrystal clear?THE hygiene hypothesispositsthat cer-tain diseases—notablyasthma, eczemaand type-1diabetes—which are becomingmore common than theyonce were, arecaused in partbymodern environmentsbeingtoo clean. The diseasesin questionresultfrom misfunctionsofthe immunesystem. The hygiene hypothesissuggestssuch misfunctionsare the resultofchil-dren’simmune systemsbeingunable tolearn, byappropriate exposure to viruses,bacteria, fungi and parasiticworms, howto respond properly. Ifmodern human homesare unnatu-rallyclean, though, theyare asnothingcompared with the facilitiesin which ex-perimental mice are housed. Those arepracticallysterile. Thatled Lili Tao and Tif-fanyReese, two researchersatthe Univer-sityofTexasSouthwestern Medical Cen-tre, in Dallas, to wonderifsuch mice woulddisplayextreme versionsofthe predic-tionsofthe hygiene hypothesis. Thiswould matter, because mice are of-ten used in medical experimentson the as-sumption thattheirreactionsare similarenough to those ofhuman beingsforthemto actasstand-ins. Conversely, laborato-ries’ spotlessnessmightalso mean miceare sometimestoo healthyto actasusefulmodelsfordisease.

These miceare also betterable than othersto handleretrovirusinfections. And the eﬀects onthem ofmultiple sclerosis—an illness theunderlyingcause ofwhich issuspected tobe an inappropriate immune response—are reduced.On the otherhand, earlyinfection withadiﬀerentcommon pathogen, Yersiniapseudotuberculosis, aﬀectsmurine im-mune systemsin a waythatleavesmicemore open to subsequentattack, ratherthan lessso—the reverse ofthe hygiene hy-pothesis. Byunknown means, such infec-tion permanentlydivertsimmune cellscalled dendriticcellsfrom theirnormalhomesin lymph nodesand to the wall ofthe gut, where theycause sustained in-ﬂammation. Similarly, earlyexposure tocertain herpesviruses, also common in thewild, can resultin latentinfections thatcause no perceptible symptomsunlessakind ofparasiticworm called a helminthalso turnsup. Thatreactivatesthe infec-tion. Anyone attemptingto mimichumanworm infestationsusingmice should beaware ofthis.Those studyingvaccines, too, need tobe aware ofthe confoundingeﬀectsof hy-giene. Laboratory-bred mice have fewermemoryT-cellsthan those broughtup inthe outside world. MemoryT-cellsare thepartsofthe immune-system thatremem-berpriorinfections, thusenablinga rapidresponse ifthe agentwhich caused that in-fection isencountered again.

Asisoften the case with these sorts ofpreliminaryliterature reviews, the out-come isa grab-bagofintriguingresults,ratherthan a coherenthypothesisorpre-scription foraction. Butthe evidence DrTao and DrReese have assembled suggeststhere issomethinggoingon here thatneedsinvestigating. Itseemsto be a classicexample ofthe lawofunintended conse-quences. The pointofraisingmice hygieni-callyisto eliminate asmanyuncontrolledfactorsfrom an experimentaspossible.Thathygiene itselfmightbe such a factorhasnot, until now, crossed people’sminds.Howto respond isunclear. Runningtrialstwice, with “dirty” and “clean” mice,could be one approach. Anothermightbeto agree on a setofbugsto which early ex-posure ispermitted. Whatthisworkdoesshow, though, isthatin research, cleanli-nessisnotnecessarilynextto godliness.7PalaeontologyOld hipstersASEVERYschool-aged aﬁcionado ofdinosaursknows, those terriblereptilesare divided into two groups: theSaurischia and the Ornithischia—or, topeople forwhom thatisall Greek, thelizard-hipped and the bird-hipped. Thenamesgo back130 years, to 1887, whentheywere invented and applied byHarrySeeley, a British palaeontologist. Seeleydetermined thatthe arrange-mentofthe bonesin a dinosaur’spelvis—speciﬁcally, whetherthe pubicbonepointsforwards(Saurischia) orback-wards(Ornithischia)—could be used toassign thatspeciesto one ofthese twogroups. In hisview, and thatofsub-sequentpalaeontologists, the evolutionofotherfeaturesofdinosaurskeletonssupported the idea thatthese two hip-deﬁned groupswere whatare nowre-ferred to asclades, each havinga singlecommon ancestor. Seeleytherebythoughthe had overthrown the dino-saursasa true clade themselves: hebelieved Saurischia and Ornithischiawere descended separatelyfrom a groupcalled the thecodonts.Subsequentanalysissuggestshe waswrongaboutthat. The dinosaursdoseem to be a properclade, with a singlethecodontancestor. Butthe basicdivi-sion Seeleymade ofthem, into Sau-rischia and the Ornithischia, hasnotbeen challenged—until now.The challengersare MatthewBaron,ofCambridge University, and hiscol-leagues. Writingin Nature, theysuggestdinosaurclassiﬁcation needsto be shak-en up. Theirsystem still hastwo groups,butitlooksverydiﬀerentfrom Seeley’s. Based on an analysisof74 typesofdinosaursand close relativesofdino-saurs, which examined 457 skeletal char-acteristics, theypropose thathip-struc-ture isnotthe be-all and end-all thatSeeleyand hissuccessorsthoughtit was.Instead, theyseparate the two greatsubgroupsofSaurischia, the sauropods(Brontosaurus, Diplodocus, etc) and thetheropods(Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus,etc) and reassign them. The sauropodsare teamed up with a group called theHerrerasauridae, which are so primitivetheyare noteasilyﬁtted into the Sau-rischia-Ornithischia system, to form areconstituted Saurischia. The restof theOrnithischia and the theropods, mean-while, are joined asa newlynamedgroup, the Ornithoscelida.WhetherDrBaron’sclassiﬁcation willhold up remainsto be seen. Anysystembased on comparative anatomyratherthan DNAisvulnerable to the evolutionofsimilarfeatureson separate occa-sions—givingan illusion ofrelatednessthatisactuallyuntrue. Indeed, the pro-blem with relyingon anatomical fea-tures, such aship-shape, to classify ani-malsiswell illustrated bydinosaursthemselves.

Whydid America electDonald Trump? Whyare populistson therise all overEurope? David Goodhart,foundingeditorofProspectmagazine andnowa proud “post-liberal”, hasfound aculprit. Populism, he arguesin hisnewbook, isan understandable reaction to lib-eral overreach. Focusingon Britain, he identiﬁes a newdivide in Western societies, pittinga domi-nantminorityofpeople from “anywhere”againsta majorityfrom “somewhere”. Theﬁrstgroup, saysMrGoodhart, holds“achieved” identitiesbased on education-al and professional success. Anywheresvalue social and geographical mobility.The second group ischaracterised byiden-titiesrooted in a place, and itsmembersvalue family, authorityand nationality. WhereasAnywheres, whose portableidentitiesare well-suited to the globaleconomy, have largelybeneﬁted from cul-tural and economicopennessin the West,he argues, the Somewhereshave been leftbehind—economically, butmainlyintermsofrespectforthe thingstheyholddear.

Although the blues—espe-ciallyasplayed byhisidol MuddyWaters—are all overMrBerry’smusic, hislankyﬁn-gersplayed longerand wildersolos, andhe wrote new, challenginglicksforeverysonghe recorded. Whatmade him stand out, however,wasthathe wasﬁrstand foremosta story-teller. He loved wordsand worked hard onthem, modellinghisuproarioustalesonLouisJordan’sand hisenunciation on NatKingCole’s. He sangofand forthe newteenage world ofsoda fountains, jukebox-es, cars, sexin cars(ifonlyhe could unfas-ten hersafetybelt), breakingoutand break-ingfree. In MrBerry’sworld, all things arepossible. “JohnnyB. Goode”, the poorcountryboywho becomesrock’sﬁrsthero,maysee hisname in lightsbecause “hecould playa guitarjustlike ringin’ a bell”. Because hissongswere, atleaston pa-per, simple in structure, theirsophistica-tion can slip byunnoticed. Buthishits be-come fastfriendsthrough humour. “RollOverBeethoven” adds, “and tell Tchaikov-skythe news.” “Maybellene” begins, “AsIwasmotivatin’ overthe hill/I sawMaybel-lene in a Coupe de Ville”. (He isin a V8Ford, which soon overheatsin the chase.)“YouCan’tCatch Me” takesitfurtherwhenhiscar, a Flightde Ville air-mobile, avoidsthe state patrol bylettingdown wings andtakingoﬀin a “coooool breeze”. Overthecourse of“Brown Eyed HandsomeMan”—a then-daringpaean to the allure ofdark-skinned men—MrBerryroamsfrom acourtroom to India, to the Venusde Milolosingherarmsin a wrestlingmatch, to abaseball game, all in justtwo minutes. Indeed, he could take youanywhere,coastto coast.

She goesasfarasto imply thatKahn, who asa child burned hisface sobadlyhe wasdisﬁgured forlife, had doneso in search ofa transcendenttruth.The bookissuperblyresearched,though. MsLesserdescribesthe convolut-ed wayin which Kahn’spoorlymanagedarchitectural practice overlapped with atorturouspersonal life, cross-referencingworkand personal diaries. Although thearchitectremained married to hiswife Es-theruntil hisdeath, atone stage he washavingaﬀairswith three diﬀerentwomeneitherin orcloselyrelated to hispractice.He had a second daughterwith Anne Tyng,an architectin hisPhiladelphia oﬃce, andfathered a sonwith HarrietPattison, alandscape architectwith whom he collab-orated on the Kimbell ArtMuseum in FortWorth, Texas.MsLessercapturesthe charisma ofKahn: hisgoofypiano-playingforfriendsand familyand hisincessanturge towardsartisticcreation. Where the bookislessstrongison Kahn’stiesto the political andaestheticdebatesofhisage. Here, after all,isa man whose life wasdeeplyinﬂuencedbyFranklin Roosevelt’svision forAmerica.Kahn campaigned on the need to buildcheap housingaspartofhisearlypractice,and illustrated pamphletsforthe UnitedStatesHousingAuthority. Justbefore hedied, he produced a compellingdesign foramemorial to the presidenton NewYork’sRooseveltIsland.Even ifhe reallywasscared oﬀfrom engagementwith politicsbyMcCarthyism, asMsLessersuggests, hisarchitecture, operatingasitdid in the realworld, in dialogue with planners, contrac-torsand the public, had no such choice. MsLesserishonestenough to quotethose who disagree with heridea thatthere wasa linkbetween Kahn’slibido andhiscreative urge. Butshe nonetheless fol-lowsthisnotion to argue, forexample, thatKahn’sprimitive shapes—the staggeredstudytowersatthe SalkInstitute, for exam-ple—were symptomaticofa search foranaestheticlanguage offreedom, asmuch ashisaﬀairswere a search forsexual free-dom. Had MsLesserspentmore time inthisotherwise excellentstudycomparingKahn with equallycreative architects withlesscomplicated personal lives, she mayneverhave arrived atthattheory. It isjustaslikelythatKahn waslookingatthe wayin which corporate America had success-fullyco-opted Modernism and wastryingto reassertitshumanistpurpose.

than they did in 1990 and nowspend twice as much time at school. Syriaand Swaziland have both seen theirscores deteriorate. One estimate sug-gests that during the ﬁrst two years of itswar, Syria lost the equivalent of 35 yearsof progress in human development.

The ﬁrst—the one thatmade himraise hishead from hisjob packingbaconforDoherty’sin Derry, and take an interestin civil rights—waswhen the Royal UlsterConstabularybeatup marchersin DukeStreetin October1968. He was18 then, andforthe ﬁrsttime he tookup stones, bombs,anything, and spenthiseveningsattackingthe police. The momenthe rememberedlongest, though, waswhen theytookyoungDessie Beattie’sdyingbodyoutof acarbyhishouse. ItwasJuly8th 1971, theﬁrsttime thatthe British armyhad usedlead bulletsin Northern Ireland. Bloodwaseverywhere. Itshocked him, andscared him more than a little. He had neverseen anyone killed bya bulletbefore. Itwascrystal clearto him thatthis wasawar, and had to be foughtlike one. Armiesmustoppose armies. There wasa peacefulpath available, through political pressureand the Social Democraticand LabourParty, buthe did nottake it. Nothing couldbe achieved thatway. Hisaim wasnow toﬁghtuntil the lastBritish soldierwas dri-ven down the RiverFoyle ordown the Lag-an, and Ireland became a socialistrepublicof32 counties. From 1976 he tooksharedcommand ofthe Irish Republican Army,groomed itsvolunteers, organised itsbloodycampaigns, improved itsweapon-ry(from fertiliserstuﬀed in milkchurns tosurface-to-airmissilesfrom Libya) andplayed the alternatelyshiftingorimmov-able hard man in talks, orback-channelmanoeuvres, with the British government. And on the otherhand there he was, in1997, ministerofeducation in the ﬁrstunionist-republican power-sharingexecu-tive in Northern Ireland. He wasstill listedon the ArmyCouncil ofthe IRA; butthebomb-throwerwasnowcongenialityit-self, and the mostviolentthinghe was pro-posingwasto scrap the 11-plusexam,which he had failed asa child. And therehe wasin 2007, even more astonishingly,deputyﬁrstministerto Ian Paisley, themostdiehard ofthe arch-unionists, laugh-ingalongwith him and havingthe craic,until theywere known asthe ChuckleBrothers. In 2014, all smiles, he shookthehand ofQueen Elizabeth. People were con-founded bythe change. Yetto hismind, there wasno change. In2017 he wasascommitted a republican ashe had been atthe start.
