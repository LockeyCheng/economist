OnlyAlz-heimer’sexertsa similargrip on the imagination.Confronted with thissortofenemy, people understand-ablyfocuson the potential forscientiﬁcbreakthroughs thatwill delivera cure. Theirhope isnotmisplaced. Cancer hasbe-come more and more survivable overrecentdecadesowing toahostofadvances, from geneticsequencingto targeted thera-pies. The ﬁve-yearsurvival rate forleukemia in America hasal-mostdoubled, from 34% in the mid-1970sto 63% in 2006-12.America ishome to about15.5m cancersurvivors, a numberthatwill growto 20m in the nextten years. Developingcoun-trieshave made biggains, too: in partsofCentral and SouthAmerica, survival ratesforprostate and breastcancer havejumped byasmuch asa ﬁfth in onlya decade.From a purelytechnical perspective, itisreasonable to ex-pectthatscience will one dayturn mostcancersinto eitherchronicdiseasesorcurable ones. Butcancerisnotfought onlyin the lab. Itisalso foughtin doctors’ surgeries, in schools, inpublic-health systemsand in governmentdepartments. Thedispatchesfrom these battleﬁeldsare much lessencouraging. Cell-side researchFirst, the good news. Caughtearly, manycancersare now high-lytreatable. Three outoffourBritish men who received a pros-tate-cancerdiagnosisin the early1970sdid notlive foranotherten years; todayfouroutofﬁve do. Othercancers, such asthose ofthe lung, pancreasand brain, are harderto ﬁnd andtreat. ButasourTechnologyQuarterlyin thisissue shows, pro-gressisbeingmade. Techniquesto enable earlydiagnosis in-clude a device designed to detectcanceron the breath; bloodtestscan trackfragmentsofDNAshed from tumours. Genomesequencingmakesitevereasierto identifynewdrugtargets. The established trio of20th-centurycancertreatments—surgery, radiation and chemotherapy—are all still improving.Radiotherapistscan create websofgamma rays, whose inter-sectionsdeliverdoseshigh enough to kill tumoursbut whichdo lessdamage to healthytissue astheyenterand leave thebody. Some newdrugsthrottle the growth ofblood vesselsbringingnutrientsto tumours; othersattackcancercells’ ownDNA-repairkits. Cancermaybe relentless; so too is science.The greatestexcitementisreserved forimmunotherapy, anewapproach thathasemerged in the pastfewyears. The hu-man immune system isequipped with a setofbrakesthat can-cercellsare able to activate; the ﬁrstimmunotherapy treat-mentin eﬀectdisablesthe brakes, enablingwhite blood cellsto attackthe tumours. Itisearlydays, butin a small subsetofpatientsthismechanism hasproduced long-term remissionsthatare tantamountto cures. Well over1,000 clinical trials ofsuch treatmentsare underway, targetinga wide range ofdiﬀer-entcancers. Itiseven nowpossible to reprogram immune cellsto ﬁghtcancerbetterbyeditingtheirgenomes; the ﬁrst suchgene therapywasapproved foruse in America lastmonth.Yetcancersuﬀerersneed notwaitforthe therapies ofto-morrowto have a betterchance ofsurvival today. Across richand poorcountries, the survivabilityofcancervaries enor-mously. Men die atfarhigherratesthan women in some coun-tries; in othercountries, atsimilarlevelsofdevelopment, theydo comparablywell. The ﬁve-yearsurvival rate fora setofthree common cancersin America and Canada isabove 70%;Germanyachieves64%, whereasBritain managesa mere 52%.Disparitiesexistwithin countries, too. America does well in itstreatmentofcanceroverall, butsuﬀersextraordinary inequal-itiesin outcomes. The death rate ofblackAmerican men fromall cancersis24% higherthan itisforwhite males; breast-can-cerdeath ratesamongblacksare 42% higherthan forwhites. Adiagnosisin rural America isdeadlierthan one in its cities. Practical as well as pioneeringVariationsbetween countriesare partlya reﬂection of health-care spending: more than halfofpatientsrequiringradiothera-pyin low- and middle-income countriesdo nothave access totreatment. Butbigbudgetsdo notguarantee good outcomes.Iceland and Portugal do notoutspend England and Denmarkon health care asa proportion ofGDP, butpaststudiesshowwide variation in survivabilityin all cancers. Instead, the problem isoften howmoneyisspent, not howmuch ofitthere is. To take one example, a vaccine existsagainstthe human papillomavirus(HPV), which causescan-cersofthe cervixin women, aswell ascancersofthe head andneck. Rwanda started a programme ofroutine vaccination in2011, and aimsto eradicate cervical cancerby2020. Othercountriesare farlesssystematic. Vaccinationscould help pre-ventcervical cancerin 120,000 Indian women each year.Policymakersare notpowerless. More can be done to verifywhich treatments(and combinationsthereof) workbest. A£1.3bn ($2bn) cancer-drugfund in England, which made expen-sive newmedicineseasierto obtain, did notassessthe eﬃcacyofthe drugsitprovided—a huge missed opportunity. Measur-ingthe incidence and survival ofcancer, through cancer regis-tries, spotlightswhere patientsare beingfailed. Access tohealth care matters, too: the numberofAmericanswhose can-cerswere diagnosed atthe earliestpossible opportunity wentup afterObamacare wasenacted. And prevention remains thebestcure ofall. Eﬀortsto rein in tobacco use averted 22mdeaths(manyofthem to cancer) between 2008 and 2014. Yetonlya tenth ofthe world’spopulation livesin countrieswheretaxesmake up atleastthree-quartersofthe price of cigarettes,asrecommended bythe World Health Organisation. Taxesand budgetingare a lotlessexcitingthan tumour-zap-pingproton beamsand antibodieswith superpowers. But thedecisionsoftechnocratsare asimportantasthe work oftech-nicians. Cancerkillsmillionsofpeople notsimplyfor wantofscientiﬁcadvance, butalso because ofbad policy. 7Closingin on cancerScience will win the technical battle againstcancer. Butthatis onlyhalfthe ﬁghtLeaders12LeadersThe EconomistSeptember16th20171BEFORE tearingup partsofFlorida, Hurricane Irma rav-aged whole Caribbean islands.In doingso, itexposed thestrange territorial shredsthatmake up the region: itdestroyedBarbuda, Antigua’spoorerpartnerin theirindependentstate; itwrecked mostdwellingson StMartin, an island divid-ed between France and the Netherlands; itﬂattened Tortola,the largestofthe British Virgin Islands, and StJohn in theAmerican-owned halfofthe same archipelago. The storm didnotkill huge numbersofpeople—around 40 before ithittheAmerican mainland and probablyfewerthan 80 all told—butthe economictoll in small island territoriesisimmense. In theUnited Statesthe propertydamage wroughtbyIrma and Har-vey, an earlierstorm thatstruckHouston, isequivalent toabout1.5% ofGDP. Irma’scostto some small Caribbean is-lands, which promote themselvesastouristparadises, exceedstheirGDP(see page 37). Asthe strongesthurricane everto hitsome ofthose islands,Irma isa harbinger. Warmerseaswill strengthen hurricanes,and highersea levelswill make storm surgesmore destructive.These will smash the beach resortsfrom which the Caribbeanlargelymakesitsliving(some are taxhavens, too). A one-metrerise in sea levels, which mighthappen in thiscentury, coulddisplace more than 100,000 people in the region.The islandshave learned some lessonssince HurricaneIvan smashed into Grenada in 2004. Theyare betteratprovid-ingshelter, which helped to limitthe death toll. Aregional di-saster-insurance scheme, called CCRIF, paysoutquickly(seepage 38), softeningthe economicblow. CDEMA, a regionalbody, co-ordinatesplanningand reliefforits18 members, in-cludingBritish overseasterritories. Butgovernmentshave failed to do manyofthe hard thingsneeded to make theirislandsmore resilient. Building codeswritten with the stormsofyesteryearin mind are spottily en-forced. Much ofthe region’spopulation occupieshousingtooﬂimsyto withstand severe storms. Developersrip out protec-tive mangrove swampsto plonkhotelsbythe water’sedge.Fixingsuch problemsisexpensive, and politicianshave trou-ble seeingbeyond the nextelection.Weakbureaucraciesand political fragmentation make itharder. Regional governmentsgive little supportto the jointinitiativestheyhave created. Even asIrma loomed, CDEMA’smembershad yetto approve the budgetofitsdisaster co-ordi-nation unit. The Caribbean CommunityClimate Change Cen-tre, which helpsitsmembersadjustto climate change, getsal-mostno moneyfrom them.Category-ﬁve imperativesTo weatherthe comingstorms, aswell asearthquakesanddroughts, the region will have to do much more. Billions ofdollarswill have to be spenton upgradingbuildings, roadsandotherinfrastructure. When stormslike Irma force islands to re-build, hotelsand roadsshould be moved fartherbackfrom theshore and builtto standardssetacrossthe region. CCRIFshould be expanded and strengthened, forexample byrequir-ingcountriesto have contingencyplansforspendingthe mon-eytheyclaim. CDEMAneedsstrongerbackingfrom itsmem-bers; itshould be able to mobilise ﬂeetsofboatsand planesatshortnotice when disasterstrikes.Betterplanningand more co-operation will notbe enough.Caribbean islandswill need help from theirEuropean andNorth American patronsand otherdonorsto adaptto the di-sastersthatwill followIrma. And global action on climatemustbecome much more ambitious. Otherwise, large parts ofparadise will eventuallybe washed away. 7Hurricane IrmaCaribbean confettiByworking together, Caribbean countries can do a lotmore to prepare forand respond to disastersTHE long-feared “Shia cres-cent”, stretchingfrom Iran toLebanon, isnowmaterialising.Asthe Sunni jihadistsofIslamicState (IS) are crushed bydispa-rate militarycoalitions, theirplace isbeingﬁlled byradicalsofthe Shia sortsponsored byIran—Lebanon’sHizbullah group, local militiasand mercenar-iesrecruited from asfarasAfghanistan and Pakistan.The prospectofIranian hegemonyisraisingalarm acrossthe region (see Brieﬁng).

And tearingup the nuclearaccord wouldremove an essential constrainton Iran.The renewed focuson the nuclearaccord is, in part, a func-tion ofthe calendar. Undercongressional rules, the presidentmustcertifyeverythree monthsthatIran iscomplying withthe deal (the JointComprehensive Plan ofAction, orJCPOA);and thatwaivingnuclear-related sanctionsisvital to Ameri-can interests. Though he campaigned againstthe accord, MrTrump hastwice certiﬁed thatIran wasabidingbyits terms.The nextcertiﬁcation isdue in October. MrTrump does notwantto grantit, even though the UN’snuclearinspectorsre-portthatIran isstickingto the bargain. Instead Nikki Haley, hisambassadorto the UN, signalled thatMrTrump could “decer-tify” Iran’scompliance, perhapscitingnational-security inter-ests, withoutformallywithdrawingfrom the JCPOA—leavingCongressto decide what, ifany, sanctionsto reimpose. Thatwould be a dereliction ofpresidential responsibility.Devisingand implementinga complexstrategyto counter Iranisthe job ofthe executive, notthe legislature. Whether Con-gressripsup JCPOA ornot, MrTrump will be signallingthatAmerica cannotbe trusted to keep a bargain. And without aclearbreach byIran, European stateswill notsupport sanc-tions. Iranian hardlinerswould be strengthened, and might re-sume the nuclearprogramme. Ifso, the question forAmerica(orIsrael) would once more be whetherto bomb Iran’snuclearsites. Iran hasmanywaysofretaliating. MsHaleyconsidersthe JCPOA to be so ﬂawed that, withoutstrongaction againstIran, “we will be dealingwith the nextNorth Korea”.

MosturgentisSyria. MrTrump boaststhatAmerica has lit-tle businessthere “otherthan killingISIS [IS]”. In fact, allowingBasharal-Assad, Syria’spresident, to settle the waron his ma-lign termswill entrench Iranian power. America should pushharderforitsalliesto seize Syria’seastern borderpostsbeforeMrAssad and hisalliesgetthere—both to preventIran from cre-atinga land corridorfrom Tehran to Beirutand to gain leveragein a future peace settlement. Ifitwantsto curb Iran’sinﬂuence,America mustbe more assertive on the ground. 7ONE ofthe manyfearsaboutPresidentDonald Trumpwasthathe would packthe Fed-eral Reserve with loyalists. Thatconcern hasbeen replaced byanother: the central bank’stopechelonsare unpacked withanyone. On September6th Stan-leyFischer, a seasoned policymakerand crisis-ﬁghter (see Freeexchange), announced thatforpersonal reasonshe was retir-ingearlyasvice-chairman. Thatmeansa fourth vacancy hasopened up on the Fed’sboard; asa consequence, fourofthe 12seatson the Fed’sinterest-rate-settingcommittee are also upforgrabs. Thatnumbercould rise to ﬁve in February, when Ja-netYellen’sterm asFed chairisdue to end. MrTrump hasbeen slowto make seniorappointmentsofanykind. Butan underpowered Fed isa particularconcern. Itspolicieshelp determine everythingfrom the health of theAmerican economyto the price ofcreditin emergingmarkets.The bestwayforthe presidentto startdealingwith the backlogisto reappointMsYellen head ofthe Fed. Thatmight clash withhisinstincts. MrTrump valuesloyaltyabove competence. MsYellen, ﬁrstappointed byBarackObama, isa Democrat whohaspushed backagainstproposalsfrom the Treasurythatwould weaken ﬁnancial regulation. Buta second term for herwould provide clarityaboutthe Fed’sfuture direction and in-dependence, and make the otherpostseasierto ﬁll.The case forreappointingMsYellen isnotcutand dried. Inprinciple, itwould be betterforcentral-bankbosses nottoserve more than one term; a supplicantfora second term islikelierto do the biddingofpoliticians. The president oftheEuropean Central Bankislimited to a single eight-year term inpartforthisreason. Alan Greenspan served asFed chairmanforlongenough to inspire an unhealthycultofpersonality. Yetthe argumentsforan experienced hand to guide theeconomyalso have more powerthan usual atthe moment.The Fed facessome trickytechnical tasks, from reversing quan-titative easing(see page 63) to solvingthe puzzle ofwhylowunemploymenthasnotjuiced up inﬂation. America’secon-omyison a good run. Onlytwice in itshistoryhasitsGDPgrown formore consecutive quarters. Mistakesin monetarypolicyare often made asthe economiccycle matures, whenjudgmentsaboutthe rightinterestrate are hardest. And whenthe nextrecession arrives, the Fed will nothave much ﬁrepow-er: itspolicyrate isunlikelyto be much above 2%, leavinglittleroom to cut. Aseasoned policymakerwill be all the more valu-able, since the Treasuryisalso notablyshortofthem. Asecond reason to reappointMsYellen isthatthe Republi-can-backed candidatesto replace herare notimpressive. GaryCohn, MrTrump’ssenioreconomicadviser, hasno experienceasa central banker. (He mayalso have scuppered hischancesbycriticisinghisboss’sresponse to the recentviolence in Char-lottesville.) Anotheraspirant, Kevin Warsh, served on theFed’sopen-marketcommittee from 2006 to 2011, and hasbeen The Federal ReserveDangerouslyvacantWhyDonald Trump should reappointJanetYellen to lead the FedThe EconomistSeptember16th2017 Leaders152lobbyinghard forthe top job.

Anotherofthe co-authors, JohnTaylorofStanford University, mightbe too rigid in his judg-mentson interestrateswhen discretion isneeded.

EveryFedchairman since the late 1970shasbeen given a second term byapresidentfrom a diﬀerentparty. Paul Volcker, a Democrat,wasreappointed byRonald Reagan. Bill Clinton gave MrGreenspan, a Republican, a second term. And Ben Bernankewasrenominated byMrObama. The Fed issupposed to standabove politics; ideallythe appointmentshould have biparti-san support. IfMrTrump isnotswayed byprecedent, he mightbe convinced bya more practical concern: MsYellen’sconﬁr-mation would be lessfraughtthan thatofothercandidates. Fourmore yearsNone ofthese argumentswould carrymuch weightifMs Yel-len had notdone a good job. Butshe has.

So there wasgrim ironyin the newsthat theﬁrm hasbeen the victim of aparticularlybigand damagingdata breach. The companyreck-onsthatmore than 143m people, mostlyAmericans, have beenaﬀected. The pilfered data include addresses, credit-card de-tailsand Social Securitynumbers. The Social Security num-bersare especiallyvaluable: theyare the closestthing Americahasto a centralised national-identitysystem, and are farhard-erto change than a password on a compromised account. Aseriesofself-inﬂicted woundsmade thingsmuch worse(see page 65). Aricketywebsite setup so thatcustomers couldcheckwhethertheyhad been aﬀected seemed to require themto waive theirrightto sue (notso, insisted the ﬁrm, which laterchanged the site). Those who wanted to freeze creditcheckswere atﬁrstasked to pay. Seniormanagerssold shares afterthebreach had been discovered, butbefore ithad been made pub-lic(the ﬁrm insistsno insidertradinghastaken place). Lawyersand attorneys-general are rightto wantto investigate. There butforthe grace…The breach wasbigbutEquifaxisno outlier. Lastyear Yahoo re-vealed thathackershad swiped detailsfrom more than 1bn ac-counts; AdultFriendFinder, a casual-sexsite, had more than400m accountscompromised. Disruptionsfrom cyber-attackshurtinvestorson a regularbasis. A.P. Moller-Maersk, a bigship-pingcompany, had itscomputersfrozen bymalware earlierthisyear; itreckonsthe lossescould reach $300m. The same at-tackcostReckittBenckiser, a consumer-goodsﬁrm, £100m($133m) in lostsales. Firmsthatmightonce have been temptedto shrugoﬀthe dangersare increasinglyatriskofregulatory ac-tion. NewEuropean lawsenvisage heftyﬁnesfornon-compli-ance with cyber-securitystandards; rulesenacted byNewYork’sﬁnancial regulatorcame into force in August. The nature ofthe threatischanging, too. The computerisa-tion ofeverydayobjects, forinstance, turnsthe whole worldinto a hacker’splayground. One casino recentlysuﬀered a databreach afterhackersgained accessto an internet-connectedﬁsh tank, and jumped from there to more sensitive parts ofthecompany’snetwork. Hackersare also changingtheirbusinessmodels. Instead ofsellingdata on the blackmarket, some aretryingto hold companiesto ransom, asNetﬂix, a video-streamingﬁrm, discovered in April when thievesmade oﬀwith an unaired episode ofone ofitshitprogrammes.Whatto do? Two principlesoughtto guide the waythatﬁrmsplan theircyber-security. The ﬁrstisto take a layered ap-proach to defence. Thatishowsocietiesthinkaboutmany oth-errisks.

Ifthat isnotenough,emergencyservicesand hospitalstryto ﬁxthe damage. Thissortofthinkingisrelativelynewin the computer-secu-ritybusiness, which hastended to focusmostlyon prevention.Asmore attention ispaid to mitigation and disasterrecovery,ﬁrmsshould take a similarapproach themselves. Walling oﬀdiﬀerentchunksofsensitive data within a company, for in-stance, can reduce the impactofanyhacksthatdo breach theouterdefences. Planningin advance howto respond to a hackreducesthe riskofEquifax-like botches. The second principle isto thinkaboutdata more intelligent-ly, includinghowmuch isstored, and forhowlong. Firmsmostlyregard information asan asset. The attractions oftech-nologiessuch asartiﬁcial intelligence encourage them to stock-pile asmuch aspossible. Butthe same digital infrastructurethatmakespilesofdata useful makesthem vulnerable to any-one who fanciestryingto swipe them. That—and regulators’increasingimpatience with leaks—makesdata a source of busi-nessand legal risk. Thisnewspaperhasargued that, in power-ingthe economy, data are todaywhatoil wasin the 20th cen-tury. The analogyisapt. Oil isvaluable stuﬀ.

But he getsachance to do so every90 days—and thenextopportunityiscomingup. The Iran NuclearAgreementReviewAct(INARA) of2015 obligesthe administra-tion to certifyto CongresseverythreemonthsthatIran isveriﬁablyand fully im-plementingthe JointComprehensive PlanofAction (JCPOA), asthe Iran deal is for-mallyknown; thatithasnotbroken agreedlimitson itsstockpilesofvariousnuclearmaterials; thatithasnottaken anyactionthatcould advance a nuclear-weaponsprogramme; and thatcontinued suspen-sion ofnuclear-related sanctionsisvital toAmerica’snational security. Ifthe presi-dentdoesnotconﬁrm all thisthe issue isthrown backto Congress, which after60dayscan vote to reimpose sanctions. MrTrump ﬁrstcertiﬁed thatIran wasmeetingitsobligationsin April. When hedid so a second time, in July, he reportedlylambasted hisnational-securityteam, andin particularhissecretaryofstate, RexTil-lerson (pictured, left), forfailingto providehim with a case provingIran’sbad faith.When the nextreviewcomesup in Octo-berMrTrump will be furnished with sucharguments, howeverspecious. The admin-istration will have diﬃcultywithholdingcertiﬁcation on the ﬁrstthree grounds.Though Nikki Haley, America’sambassa-dorto the UN(pictured, right), hassaid thatIran isguiltyof“multiple violations” oftheJCPOA,herassertion doesnotbearscruti-ny. The International AtomicEnergyAgen-cy, the UN’snuclearwatchdog, which is re-sponsible formonitoringIran’scom-pliance and inspectingitsnuclearfacilities,said earlierthismonth thateverything wasin orderand thatitsinspectorswere able togo where theywanted “withoutmakingdistinctionsbetween militaryand civilianlocations”. The reference to the siteswasin re-sponse to complaintsbyMsHaleyand oth-ersin the administration thatIran is notal-lowingroutine accessto some militarybases. Thisistrue: butthe JCPOAdoesnotrequire itto. Some sitesmaybe visited onlyafteran (admittedlycumbersome) proce-dure involvingsubmittingevidence ofbanned activitiesto a jointcommission ofthe JCPOAsignatories(America, Britain,France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran).Ifthe Iranianshave no satisfactoryexpla-nation and continue to denyaccessto thesite in question, the UNSecurityCouncilwould then be asked to vote on restoringinternational nuclear-related sanctions. There isthusno evidence thatIran is do-inganythingwhich would meritdecertiﬁ-cation. Butthe fourth condition INARAim-poses—takinga viewofwhatisorisnot inAmerica’snational-securityinterest—is es-sentiallysubjective. MrTillerson, JamesMattis, the defence secretaryand the na-tional securityadviser, H.R. McMaster, allbelieve thatstickingwith the JCPOAisinthe national interest. Butotherﬁgures maythinkotherwise. The CIA director, MikePompeo, when a congressman, wasaﬁerce criticofthe deal. In takinga hawkishline, MsHaleymaybe positioningherselfto replace the lacklustre MrTillerson.In a speech to a conservative think-tankon September5th, MsHaleyindicated thatCongressshould be allowed to debate theissue. “Ifthe presidentﬁndsthathe cannotin good faith certifyIranian compliance, hewould initiate a processwherebywe movebeyond the narrowtechnicalitiesand lookatthe bigpicture.” Thatpicture seesIran,through its“destabilising” behaviourinthe region (see nextstory), itssupport forterrorism and itsballistic-missile tests, asﬂoutingthe “spirit” ofthe JCPOA.Thisisto misunderstand the JCPOA.ItisNotquite a dead certDonald Trump’s distaste forBarackObama’s deal to restrain Iran’s nuclearcapabilities could make the world a more dangerous placeBrieﬁngIran and the world19The Syrian endgame20The Kurdish conundrumAlso in this sectionThe Economist September16th2017BrieﬁngIranandtheworld192true thatBarackObama expressed a hopethatrelationswith Iran mightimproveovertime asrelieffrom sanctionsallowedIran to open up itseconomy. Butthe deal it-selfwasneverpresented asanythingotherthan a highlytechnical arms-control agree-ment. Itwasdesigned speciﬁcallyto makeitimpossible forIran to produce a nuclearweapon foratleast15 yearsand, thereafter,to make itprohibitivelydiﬃcultfor itto doso withoutbeingexposed. The JCPOA’scriticssaytheywanta“betterdeal” in which the entire nuclear in-frastructure isdismantled and Iran stopsthrowingitsweightaround in the region.Buttheyhave no plausible accountof howsuch a thingmightbe broughtabout. If MrTrump blowsup the JCPOA,Iran, free ofconstraints, could crankup itsenrichmentprogramme and take a chance on develop-ingnuclearweapons. Iran’sleadersmightreasonablycalculate thatthe prospects ofMrTrump rebuildingthe international co-alition on sanctionspainstakinglyput to-getherbyMrObama would be slim.America could wage a preventive warto stop Iran from becominga nuclear-armed state. Butmostmilitaryexpertsagree thatairstrikesto destroyIran’snuc-learfacilitieswould onlyslowitspath to abomb bya yearortwo, and wouldstrengthen the regime in the long-term.Onlya warto bringaboutregime changewould suﬃce. The example ofIraq, a muchweakercountry, isnotencouraging.Itismore likelythatthe JCPOA, which isstronglysupported bythe othersignato-ries, will limp on, weakened butnotkilledbyMrTrump’sdecertiﬁcation. The lasttime the Senate voted on the JCPOAin 2015itscriticshad a 58-42 majority; a Democrat-icﬁlibustersaved MrObama from exercis-inghisveto. ButRobertEinhorn, a formerState Departmentadviseron armscontrolnowatthe BrookingsInstitution, ques-tionswhetherthere would nowbe a Sen-ate majorityforreimposingnuclear-relat-ed sanctionsifthe administration’sargumentsare asfeeble astheyseem to be. Regardless, decertiﬁcation on its ownwould do damage to America’salreadyshakyrelationship with itsEuropean al-lies. Itwould delightIran’shardlinerswhoneed America asa bogeyman. Iran’snon-nuclearadventurism would continue un-changed. And Iran would from then on beable crediblyto blame America ifitwere atsome pointto call time on the JCPOA. Decertifyingcould have an outcometypical ofMrTrump’spresidency. MrTrump would feel good abouthonouring apledge; an achievementofMrObama’swould be threatened; and America’srepu-tation overseaswould be furtherdimin-ished. The JCPOAitselfmightsurvive. Onthe otherhand, MrTrump’sassaulton itcould be the ﬁrststep towardsIran becom-inga problem like North Korea. He mightreﬂectthatone ofthose isquite enough. 7INTHE earlyhoursofSeptember7th air-launched missilesstrucka setofbuild-ingsnearthe town ofMasyafin westernSyria.

On September5th Syriansoldiersand Iranian-backed militiamen re-lieved the garrison in the eastern city ofDeirez-Zor, which had been besieged bythe so-called IslamicState (IS) since 2014.The advance bringsIran closeto securingan overland route thatwould run fromTehran, via Baghdad, to the Mediterra-nean. Thiswould make itmuch easierfor itto supplyHizbullah with armsand ﬁghtersfrom Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Suchaland bridgeisanathema to Israel.

WhetherRussia isable orwilling to doanythingaboutIran and Hizbullah isan-othermatter. The factthatthe recentIsraelistrike tookplace in an area underRussiancontrol suggeststhatMrPutin iscontent toallowIsrael itshead, atleastup to a point.“Russia understandsthatmilitaryen-trenchmentofIran, Hizbullah and Shia mi-litiasin Syria holdsan explosive poten-tial,” saysChagai Tzuriel, director-generalofIsrael’sMinistryofIntelligence. Thatsaid, Russia needsthe ground forcesthatIran providesto keep MrAssad in power,and preserve itsinterestsin the region. The immediate threatto Israel’ssecuri-tyremainsHizbullah. The lastwarbe-tween the two sides, in 2006, ended in adrawofsorts. Thismonth, in itslargest mil-itaryexercise fornearlytwo decades, Israeldeployed an entire armycorpsto simulatearesponse to an incursion byHizbullah. Is-raeli oﬃcerssaythatthe exercise had beenscheduled forovera yearand had no con-nection to the recenttension. Israeli intelli-gence believesthatanotherwarin the nearfuture isunlikely.

Yetthe proportion ofwork-ing-age people actuallyin workhasbeenfallingsteadily(see chart). India, home to asixth ofhumanity, isin dangerofforfeitingits“demographicdividend”.The numbersare daunting. Justto keepunemploymentin check, India needstocreate some 10m-12m jobsa year.

Aslow-down in the priortwo-yearperiod, how-ever, had keptjob growth athalfthat level,leavinga shortfall of10m jobs. The tippingpointseemsto be economicgrowth ofabout7%. Ominously, growth hassteadilyslowed since 2016; in the quarterending inJune itfell to 5.7%, although transitoryfac-torsmayhave played a partin that. The data on jobsare also unreliable. Of-ﬁcially, India’sjoblessrate hashovered atan enviable 4% formanyyears. Butthe gov-ernmentisgenerousin itsdeﬁnition ofwork. Byitsown admission, some 35% ofworkersin 2015—the mostrecentyearforwhich in-depth surveysare available—hadheld a job forlessthan 11monthsin the pre-viousyear. Accordingto the World Bank,over30% ofIndiansbetween the agesof 15and 29 are NEETs, “notin education, em-ploymentortraining”.Thismaybe an exaggeration. In a coun-trywhere some 86% ofworkersare reck-oned to be in “informal” employment—ieuntaxed and withouta contract—countingcan be diﬃcult. Butthe pressure for jobsisreal.

Povertyisequal-lyentrenched, asa visitto Manila’sslumsorthe southern, partlyMuslim island ofMindanao makesclear.Butthe Philippinesisnotthe onlycountryin South-East Asiawith an entrenched establishmentpresidingoverprofound in-equality. Mostare blighted bysingle-partyrule, orby a politicalchurn which doesnotseem to have much impacton local powerstructures. Thailand, with a monarchymanipulated bythe elites,isa case in point. The purpose of12 militarycoups, two in the past12 years, hasbeen, asMichael Vatikiotisarguesin “Blood andSilk”, a perceptive newbookon the region, to maintain “an im-posingifarcane ediﬁce ofpowerand [cultivate] a conservativemindsetthathasprevented the devolution ofpowerand autono-myto ordinarypeople.”Indeed, MrDuterte mayhave more in common with ThaksinShinawatra, a formerprime ministerofThailand nowliving inself-imposed exile, than with anyFilipino predecessor, forall thatMrDuterte isfoul-mouthed and scruﬀywhere MrThaksin issil-ver-tongued and bespoke. MrThaksin sweptto powerin 2001byidentifyinghimselfwith the underdog, particularlythe ruralpoorin the country’snorth and north-east, hispolitical base. Tothe alarm ofthe establishment, which ousted him in 2006 (itdidthe same eightyearslaterto hissisteraftershe waselected byalandslide), MrThaksin appeared keen to supplantthe monarchyin the people’sfavours. Though MrDuterte, whose powerbase isin Davao cityin Mindanao, isnotchallenginga system as cosmicasthe Thai monarchy, he hasopenlyconfronted the landed andpolitical elites. He railsatthe “feudal state” and “imperial” Ma-nila. Even before he waselected, the talkatglitzydinner partieswasofhowto depose him.Both men claim to speakforthe poor. MrDuterte lambasts theCatholicchurch asbeing“full ofshit” forsupposedlycaringmoreaboutwhatitreceivesfrom the rich than whatitdoesfor the lessfortunate. Both have been drawn to leftists. When MrThaksinwasa police oﬃcerin the northern cityofChiangMai, he gottoknowsurvivorsofthe army’smassacre ofstudentsin Bangkok in1976; theyhad ﬂed to join a communistinsurgencyin the north-ern hills. Some became senioradvisersashe rose to power. Simi-larly, MrDuterte struckup relationshipswith leftists while a pros-ecutorin Davao. Hiscabinetsecretary, Leoncio Evasco, isa formerMarxistpriestand communistguerrilla.Aftertakingoﬃce, MrDuterte agreed a truce with the Philip-pines’ communistinsurgents, though itisnowfraying. He hasbeen sucked into intractable Muslim insurgenciesin the south. Inparticular, the armyistryingto retake the cityofMarawi, whichgroupsclaimingallegiance to IslamicState suddenlyseized inMay. MrThaksin, too, tooka similarno-nonsense approach to anIslamistinsurgencyin southern Thailand. Neitherman soughtpowerin orderto respectthe rule oflaw.The unwittingmodel forMrDuterte’sghastlywaron drugsis MrThaksin’ssimilarwaragainstmethamphetamine use in 2003. Inthat, more than 2,800 died in three monthsatthe handsofpoliceand vigilantes, and oﬃcialswere threatened with punishmentforfailingto meettargetsforseizuresand arrests. In MrDuterte’swar, more than 7,000 Filipinoshave died in summaryexecutionsbypolice and hitmen. AmnestyInternational describesit asamurdereconomy. Manyvictimsare small-time drugusers, oren-tirelyinnocent. ThisweekMrDuterte cutthe annual budget ofthe country’sCommission on Human Rights, a rare voice criticis-ingthe killings, to $20. Waging waron the poorItis, in eﬀect, a waron the poor—so much forMrDuterte’sclaim tospeakforthem. MrThaksin wasa more credible advocate: hisin-troduction ofcheap health care forall wasgroundbreaking. Per-hapsMrDuterte still intendsthingsofsubstance. He seems tohave talked to the communistsaboutsweepingreforms, includ-ingthe wholesale transferofland to peasants. To MrVatikiotis, who caughtup with the exile sipping whitewine in Montenegro, itwasclearthatMrThaksin’sown narrowinterestsin pursuitofpower, includingfurtheringhis multi-billion-dollarbusinesses, trumped anyreal concern for the fate offollowerstakingto the streets—and beingshot—in hissupport.Even the sudden ﬂightabroad in Augustofhissister, Yingluck Shi-nawatra, who wasfacinga controversial courtcase relating to hertime asprime minister, mightnotspell the end ofthe Shinawa-tras, whose ambitions, and pockets, are deep.AsforMrDuterte, he mustknowthe oligarchymightchal-lenge him iftheyfeel threatened.

Yetwhen MrTrump’ssecretaryofeducation,BetsyDeVos, announced herintention to“revoke orrescind” directivesto universi-tieson handlingsexual assaultissued bythe Obama administration, the move wasquietlywelcomed byplentyofcolleges.The Obama administration’sdetermina-tion to discourage campussexual assault—which issuﬀered byasmanyasa ﬁfth ofwomen attendingcollege—waswell-inten-tioned, butpoorlythoughtout.In 2011the Oﬃce ofCivil Rights(OCR)senta “DearColleague” letter—namedafteritsmisleadinglycongenial saluta-tion—which issued a sweepingreinterpre-tation ofTitle IX, a federal lawprohibitinggenderdiscrimination. The letterurgeduniversitiesto investigate sexual assaultsand conducthearingsassessed on a lowerstandard ofproof, requiringjusta “prepon-derance ofthe evidence”, or51% certaintyofguilt. Universitieswere discouragedfrom usinga tougher“clearand convinc-ing” standard because thiswasjudged tobe “notequitable”. Because the OCRletterwassentwithouttime fornotice and com-ment—stepsthatMsDeVosisrightlytakingin revisingthe policiesnow—the letterlacked the force oflaw. Still, colleges werecowed into compliance afterthe OCRthreatened to cutoﬀfederal funding to of-fendinginstitutions.Opposition to the Obama-era policiesisnotjusta cause fordubiousmen’srightsactivistsoralt-rightagitators. The mostprominentcriticshave been the faculty ofHarvard LawSchool, who publiclybrokeawayfrom Harvard University’snewsexu-al-assaultprocedures(which theysaidlacked “the mostbasicelementsoffairnessand due process”) and established theirown. Theypointed to the improperrole ofTitle IXcompliance oﬃcers, a newlysprouted type ofacademicbureaucrat,who often actasinvestigator, judge, juryand appealsboard all atonce. Some oﬃ-cersadvise the accusers, makingthem farfrom neutral. In some colleges, the accusedare notgiven complaints, and are not al-lowed to addressthe evidence gatheredagainstthem. Othercollegesskip hearingsaltogether, issuingsummaryjudgmentsafteran investigation.Storiesofmalpractice atthese courtsabound.

JCcontended in a complaint touniversityoﬃcialsthat, duringtheir rela-tionship, John would wake him up bykiss-inghim, even when JCwanted to sleep.The universityspecial examinerconclud-ed thatthe eventsconstituted “sexual vio-lence”, and a note wasmade in John’sper-manentrecord. The possibilityofracialbiasalso hauntsthe proceedings. Observ-ershave noted thatblackmen make up adisproportionate share ofthe accused.Universityoﬃcialshave also construct-ed theirown deﬁnitionsofsexual consentand ofsexual harassment. The UniversityofWyomingdemandsthatconsentshouldbe “voluntary, sober, enthusiastic, verbal,non-coerced, continual, active, and hon-est”—a hard-to-enforce edict. Italso oﬀersuniversity-recommended sextalk(“I’vegotthe ship. You’ve gotthe harbour. Can Idockforthe night?” isamongthe leastcringe-inducingsuggestions).

Such showsofcross-partyamityin Washington have grownrare. Butthe deal thatDonald Trump cutwith NancyPelosi and ChuckSchumer,DemocraticHouse and Senate leaders, toliftthe debtceiling, fund the governmentuntil Decemberand allocate $15bn in disas-terreliefhasled some to wonderwhetherbipartisanship isstaginga comeback.MrTrump seemed to promise asmuch.The adulation heaped on the deal bythosewho usuallyexcoriate him reportedlythrilled the president, a teetotal non-smok-erwhose chiefaddiction ispraise. “I thinkwe will have a diﬀerentrelationship,” hesaid afterwards. “That’swhatthe people ofthe United Stateswantto see.” Theoretically, opportunitiesforfuturedealsabound. On September13th MsPe-losi and MrSchumerclaimed to havestrucka deal with the presidentto shieldundocumented immigrantsbroughttoAmerica aschildren from deportation. MrTrump and Democratshave both suggest-ed trillion-dollarinfrastructure plans; con-gressional Republicansare lessfree-hand-ed with the publicpurse.

He wasalso unwillingto riskthe chaosofa debt-ceilingbreach, orthe political blowbackofa governmentshutdown when hisown partycontrolsboth Congressand the White House. Buthe still wantsa government-funded borderwall, huge cutsto social programmesand arollbackofenvironmental regulations, allofwhich are anathema to Democrats.Congressional RepublicansknowthatMrTrump’svoterslike him more than theparty; theyare rightto worrythatthis giveshim room to manoeuvre. Butforall theteeth-gnashingfrom MessrsRyan andMcConnell, thisdeal suited them too. Theyhad no interestin a shutdown ora ﬁnan-cial meltdown.

The formerFirstLadywasalwaysmore admiredthan loved byherparty(a dirtysecretthateven the slickest Clin-ton-style stage-managementofherralliescould notconceal), andherdefeatbyDonald Trump eroded much ofthatgrudging re-gard. Worse forherresentful supporters, in post-election inter-viewsand leaked excerptsofthe book, MrsClinton appeared toblame everyone butherselfforherloss—includingSenator Ber-nie Sanders, herrival in a rancorousprimarycontestthat still di-videsthe Trump-bruised Democrats. Manyconsidered that dis-loyal. “IfI were her, I would move on,” advised David Axelrod, aDemocraticguru. Acolumnistforthe NewYorkDailyNewswasmore forthright: “Hey, HillaryClinton, shutthe f--- up and goawayalready.”MrsClinton’sbookwill rile hercriticseven more. Granted, sheownsup to hererrors, includinga naive faith in the power ofwonkish ideasto placate angryvoters, and some embarrassingbloopers. Celebratingthe death ofcoal-miningin Ohio is (no kid-ding) a particularregret. MrsClinton also acknowledges her“lim-itations” asa campaigner, includingthe carefulnessofa rote-learned performer, which manyvotersﬁnd insincere: “I wearmycomposure like a suitofarmour.” Yetnotfora momentdoesMrsClinton believe she caused herdefeat. Mostofthe 494-page tome(herbooks, produced with trusted aides, are alwaystoo long) isdedicated to causesbeyond hercontrol. MrSandersisamongthem; MrsClinton accuseshim, amongotherdirtytricks, ofpor-trayingherasa “corruptcorporatistwho couldn’tbe trusted-…pavingthe wayforTrump’s“Crooked Hillary” campaign”. Butthatistriﬂing, setagainstherthree biggestgripes.One isthe savagingofherreputation byan updated version ofthe “vastright-wingconspiracy” she accused, with some justiﬁca-tion, ofsmearingherand herhusband in the 1990s—includingradical conservative donors, fake-newspeddlersand Russianhackersand theirinternetbots, all egged on, wittingly ornot, by aRepublican candidate who “traﬃcked in darkconspiracytheo-riesdrawn from the pagesofsupermarkettabloidsand the farreachesofthe internet”. The resultswere devastating. Outcan-vassingin leafysuburbs, MrsClinton’ssupporterswere politelyassured theircandidate “had killed someone, sold drugsandcommitted anynumberofunreported crimes”. When, a monthafterthe election, an apparentlysane man shotup a pizza parlourin Washington, DC, in a bid to free the child sexslaves he believedMrsClinton had imprisoned there, no one wassurprised. Asecond complaintisthe hyperventilatingcoverage main-stream outletsgave to MrsClinton’suse ofa private e-mail serverwhile secretaryofstate. This, asshe concedes, wasa fatheadedblunder. Butitbroke no law, caused no securitybreach and, whilefrowned upon, wasnotespeciallyunusual atthe State Depart-ment. Yetitwasthe prevailingintrigue ofthe election, more inces-santlydiscussed than anyofMrTrump’smanifold scandals. Byone measure, television newsdevoted three timesasmuch air-time to MrsClinton’se-mailsasto herentire policyagenda. Herthird grievance isrelated—the late intervention into the electionofJamesComey, the then FBIdirector, to announce he had re-opened, and then thathe had closed, an investigation into MrsClinton’se-mails—even asearlyvotingwastakingplace.Even admirersofMrsClinton will curl theirtoesatthis. Noone likesa sourloser. And MrsClinton’saccountissuﬃcientlyself-servingto be open to thatcharge. In particular, she blamesthe competingdin offake newsforherfailure to persuade votersthathereconomicplans—an infrastructure package, incentivesforapprenticeshipsand so on— represented a compelling pictureoffuture prosperity. ButLexington listened hard to her economicspeechesand could notidentifythe main pointofthem—a short-comingherbookrepeats. MrsClinton insistsshe had “fundamen-tal diﬀerences” with the populistMrSanders, while also suggest-ingtheywere onlyofdegree—he vowed to soakthe rich andsplurge on everyone else; she saysthatwould be nice, but trickyto pull oﬀ, so advocatesa wateryversion ofthe same. Thiswillnotdiscourage the manyDemocratswho believe MrsClinton’sfailure to imparta compellingeconomicvision costher the elec-tion—especiallyasmanyofthem backMrSanders’svision.To the devil herdueButthere isa problem with that: MrsClinton’sanalysisisbasical-lysound. Had itnotbeen forthe uncontrollable “headwinds” shedescribes, she would probablyhave won, despite hershortcom-ings. Goinginto the election, she wasup bysixpoints; then MrComeyintruded and herlead evaporated, asundecided votersrecoiled from thisclinchingevidence ofherperﬁdy. Of course,had she been a bettercampaigner, includingon economic issues,she mighthave been furtherahead. Butthatisharderto quantify;in fact, in the rustbeltstateswhere she isthoughtto have losttheelection, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, she polled wellon economicissues. There isalso little reason to think a morepopulistmessage would have helped herthere. The white, work-ing-classvoterswho, continuinga decades-old-trend, went fromDemocratto Republican in those states, wanted lessimmigra-tion, notmore handoutsforimmigrants(amongothers) to enjoy.In thiselection, policies, messagingand campaign eﬀective-nesshardlyseemed to matter. Itwasdecided bypartisanship andinternet-borne misinformation—the enablingenvironmentandmeansbywhich MrTrump and hisproxiesdestroyed MrsClin-ton.

Afewcountrieshavemade progress. Barbadoshasan agencythatoverseesdevelopmenton the coast.Butthisisan exception. Three main barriersgetin the way. Theﬁrstisthatweatherpatternsare changingfasterthan scientistsand policymakers ex-pected. In 2012, in a projectpaid forby theWorld Bankand the governmentofStLu-cia, a CCCCC team builta “climate-smart”shelterwith a “hurricane-strapped roof”,impact-resistantwindowsand a backupgenerator. Itwassupposed to be a model.Butitcan onlywithstand a category-threestorm. Irma would have destroyed it.The second obstacle isshort-term think-ing, which encouragesfasteconomicgrowth butneglectsclimate-change plan-ning. StMartin oﬀersa good example. Atourism boom thatbegan in the 1980sat-tracted immigrants(the population of theFrench side rose from lessthan 8,000 in1982 to 38,000 in 2005). The newcomerscrowded into shantytownswhere build-ingcodeswere notenforced, saysVirginieDuvat, a French geographerwho wrote astudyofthe island in 2008. Failure to en-force the rules, and lackofplanning and in-vestment,exposed the population to hur-ricane hazards, she wrote. AfterIrma,manyofthe island’shomelessrealise that. The third barrierislackofmoney. MostCaribbean islandsare notpoor. With GDPperperson ofnearly$9,000 on average, theindependentisland statesqualifyasmid-dle- and high-income countries. Butmosthave high levelsofpublicdebtand manyhave suﬀered from a decline in prices ofag-ricultural goods.

More than two-thirdsofstructureson StMartinwere damaged ordestroyed; on Barbuda nearlyall werewrecked. In all, rebuildingthe ruinsin theCaribbean, includingPuerto Rico, will costnearly$13bn, accordingto the Centre forDisasterManagementand RiskReductionTechnologyin Germany. Justputtingbackwhatthe storm tookawaywill notbe enough thistime. Irmawasthe ﬁrstcategory-ﬁve hurricane tostrike some ofthe islandsbutitisunlikelyto be the last.

The death toll was far lowerthan in the earthquake oﬀ the coast ofMichoacán in 1985, in which at least10,000 people died, many of them inMexico City. That caused political tremors,discrediting the then-president, Miguel dela Madrid, of the InstitutionalRevolutionary Party (PRI), who seemedparalysed by the disaster. Mexico’s currentpresident, Enrique Peña Nieto, who alsobelongs to PRI, is hardly more popular. Butin the hope of avoiding his predecessor’smistakes, he visited Juchitán onSeptember 8th.Shaken Mexicomean thatthe costperperson ofbuildingand upgradinginfrastructure ishigh.

Donorsoutside the region contribute toitsshort-termism. Moneypoursin to alle-viate the eﬀectsofa disaster, butnot to pre-pare islandsforfuture ones. Regional in-surance schemesare a small step in therightdirection (see nextarticle). Caribbeangovernmentshope thatrich countrieswillprovide moneyto adaptto climate changeunderthe Parisclimate agreement, signedin 2015. Theyhave joined other“small is-land developingstates” to argue thatin-dustrialised countries, which have beenemittingcarbon dioxide longerthan devel-opingcountries, and continue to emitmore ofitperperson, should compensatethem forlossesand damage caused byex-treme weather. (Thatsaid, Trinidad and To-bago, in the southern Caribbean, isone ofthe world’sbiggestemittersperperson.)The rich have promised to contribute$100bn a yearby2020 to establish a “greenclimate fund” to payfordevelopingcoun-triesto reduce theircarbon-dioxide emis-sionsand to adaptto warming. So far,though, the fund hasraised just$10bn. Itisnotclearwhere the restwill come fromand justhowitwill be spent. Bangladesh,which ispoorerand more populousthanthe Caribbean, and isdeluged everyyear,looksto some donorslike a worthierbene-ﬁciarythan, say, Antigua and Barbuda.Rich countrieshave resisted the ideathattheybearunique responsibilityfor cli-mate change and should paycompensa-tion to countriesthatsuﬀerfrom it.

Unchecked, global warmingcouldoverwhelm the eﬀortsofeven the mostfar-sighted island governmentsto adapt toit. Thatmayforce people to leave.

Lastmonththe administration wentfurther, impos-ingselective ﬁnancial sanctionsdesignedto make itimpossible forVenezuela’sgov-ernmentand PDVSA, the state oil com-pany, to raise fresh debtin NewYork.MrMaduro’spredictable response hasbeen to denounce imperialistinterven-tion. FewLatin American governmentsinstinctivelywarm to the idea ofYanquisanctions; manywere horriﬁed byMrTrump’stalkofa “militaryoption”. Butunlike the economicembargo againstCuba, these sanctionsare limited and donotextend to third countries. They aresupported notjustbyconservatives, suchasMarco Rubio, a Republican senator, butalso byhuman-rightsgroups. Withoutsanctions, Venezuela’sleaderswould face“no tangible pressure” to change theircon-duct, saysJosé Miguel Vivanco ofHumanRightsWatch, a pressure group.The question iswhethertheywill be ef-fective. RickyWaddell, the deputynation-al securityadviser, told a conference thismonth thattheyare aimed both atpunish-ingthe regime and atpressingitto return todemocracy. Some worrythatthose goalsare contradictory.Scepticsargue thatto workthe sanc-tionsneed to be multilateral (and revers-ible ifthe regime engagesin serious negoti-ationswith the opposition).

A new era of cancer treatment

Targeting tumours

In r ich countr ies half of cancers are now sur vivable. And better understanding means that more cures
are coming, says Natasha Loder

T HERE are few whose lives have not been
touched by cancer. It cuts down friends,
loved ones, siblings, spouses, parents and
children. And it does so more than it used to.
A generation ago, one in three people in the
rich world could expect one day to hear the
fateful words, “I’m afraid you have cancer.” In some
countries it is now approaching one in two. The longer
other things do not kill you, the more of the wear and
tear that leads to cancer your cells accumulate. Live
long enough and it will be the reward.

death after heart disease; it killed 8.8m people in 2015,
three-quarters of them in low- and middle-income
countries. Between 2005 and 2015 the number of cases
increased by 33%, mostly owing to the combined ef-
fects of ageing and population growth. New cases are
expected to increase by 70% in the next 20 years.
Set against this rise is the fact that, in rich countries,
cancer is becoming more survivable. Today 67% of pa-
tients in America will survive for at least ﬁve years. Dif-
ferent cancers fare diﬀerently, as do diﬀerent sorts of
patients—cancer has proved more treatable in children
than in adults. Some cancers, such as that of the pan-
creas, have seen barely any improvement. But there
are general grounds for optimism. 
New research tools, such as easily generated anti-
bodies, rapid gene sequencing and ever easier genetic
engineering, have revolutionised biologists’ under-
standing of cancer. This understanding has allowed
more speciﬁc approaches to the disease to be devel-
oped, and the trend will continue. What is more, the
tools of molecular biology have moved out of the lab
and into the clinic. Genetic tests are used to ﬁnd the
precise vulnerabilities of a particular patient’s cancer.
Antibodies attack the speciﬁc molecules that have
gone haywire. The cells of patients with cancer are en-
gineered to better ﬁght the disease. 
And in the current decade a whole new branch of
therapy has sprung up. Unshackling the immune sys-
tem’s response to cancer, once a pipe dream, has be-

come practical medicine, with approved therapies for eight kinds
of cancer. The excitement at oncology conferences is palpable. 
As these advances have arrived regulators have increased the
speed with which treatments for life-threatening diseases are ap-
proved. This is in some ways a mixed blessing—some expensive
drugs with little if any beneﬁt are nevertheless getting to market.
But it has encouraged an unprecedented wave of investment and
innovation. The pipeline of oncology drugs in clinical develop-
ment has grown 45% in the past decade. There are currently about
600 drugs under development at biotech and pharma companies. 
The picture is not uniformly rosy. In both treatment and pre-
vention the poor are ill served. Basic chemotherapy and pain re-
lief is diﬃcult to come by in many parts of the world. The failures
are not limited to poor countries. Cancers due to bad diet, obesity,
alcohol abuse and smoking could all be reduced a great deal in
wealthy ones. And while vaccination against human papilloma
virus is routine in Rwanda, it is still limited in America—which
means thousands of American women will face cervical cancers
they could have avoided in years to come.
But if some low-hanging fruit still go tragically, lethally un-
picked, progress is not merely possible. It is happening. 7

Beginnings, and how
to spot them

It all starts with a single cell

D IANE MILLEY, a teacher, remembers getting the small,
dry cough just before school broke up for the summer in
2013. She wasn’t worried: she considered herself gener-
ally healthy—she ran three times a week and went to the
gym. Her doctor in Bradford, Massachusetts, put her on
a course of antibiotics. When they didn’t work she had
an X-ray. It showed nodules across her lungs. A bronchoscopy was
ordered to retrieve a tissue sample from her lung. As she came
round from the anaesthetic she remembers overhearing two med-
ical staﬀ talking. One said “It’s malignant.” She had late-stage lung
cancer.
Ms Milley’s body, like all human bodies, contained tens of tril-
lions of copies of her genome. In theory, all those copies should be
more or less the same. In practice, over the years, they all get
knocked around in diﬀerent ways. The oxygen that powers cell
metabolism damages the DNA on which the genes are stored as a
4

matter of course; so do background radiation and exposure to the
many low-level carcinogens; so do sunlight and infection with vi-
ruses; so do choices about diet and recreational drugs, notably al-
cohol and tobacco (from which Ms Milley abstained). 
The vast bulk of this damage is quickly ﬁxed by DNA-repair en-
zymes; fewer than one mutation in a thousand persists. But wear
and tear builds up. Many such changes make little or no diﬀerence.
A few will be of consequence to the cell concerned, reducing or
eliminating its capacity to do its job. But the loss of a single cell’s
contribution matters not a jot. 
There are some genes, though, where uncorrected damage can
matter a lot. Foremost are the genes which control cell growth,
such as HER2, which tells the cell how to make a protein called hu-
man epidermal-growth-factor receptor type 2. This is a protein
that, when it sees a particular hormone, tells the cell it is in to di-
vide. Mutations in the HER2 gene can make cells proliferate when
there is no need. When they do so their daughter cells, which will
share that HER2 mutation, will go on to do the same. 
Among some 20,000 genes in the genome there are dozens
which, like HER2, can cause unwanted cell division when they go
wrong. To forestall such problems there are various tumour-sup-
pressor genes whose job is to make sure that cells damaged in this
way shut themselves down. The best known is the gene for a pro-
tein called p53, which stops cells from reproducing if their DNA is
damaged. But these tumour-suppressor genes, too, are subject to
mutation. 

The numbers game
Thus over time, as genetic damage accumulates, the likelihood
rises that somewhere in the body’s trillions of cells there is one
that has, through ﬁve or six mutations in key genes, developed the
ability to grow without check. This likelihood is not the same for
everyone. Some people start oﬀ with quirks in their genome
which make them more susceptible. Take the genes BRCA1 and
BRCA2, which describe proteins that repair DNA; people who in-
herit a damaged version of one or the other face a higher risk of
cancer (in particular, breast and ovarian cancer) because, with one
crucial function already compromised, it takes fewer mutations
for a tumour to get going. 
Once a cancer has begun its unruly growth it will pick up more
and more mutations: the cancer genome project at the Sanger In-
stitute, outside Cambridge in England, has found that cancers can
have as few as ten mutations or as many as a few hundred.
Though all the cells in the cancer are descended from one parent
cell, they become increasingly diverse over time. Some cells come
loose and start new tumours of their own elsewhere. The body’s
immune system will often recognise that something is amiss and
try to ﬁght the cancer and slow its spread. Sometimes it wins, stop-
ping the cancer or killing it. Sometimes it doesn’t. 
When Ms Milley’s cancer was diagnosed all the things that
could go wrong already had; the tumour was well developed and
had spread through the lung and beyond. It would have been far
better for her if it had been diagnosed earlier (see chart on next
page). But with lung cancer, as with many other forms of the dis-
ease, there are often few symptoms until the disease is already at
an advanced stage. If cancer could be reliably detected earlier,
many lives might be saved. 
In some wealthy countries, some cancers—for example, those
of the breast, prostate and cervix—are regularly sought out before
they start to cause symptoms. Now researchers are trying to im-
prove diagnostic tools even further, so that more types of cancer
can be found early on (and with greater reliability). For some it is a
terribly personal hunt. Billy Boyle, the president of a small biotech
company, Owlstone Medical, based in Cambridge, in England, is
one of them. He lost his wife Kate, mother to their two young boys,
on Christmas morning in 2014. She died of colon cancer that had
been picked up too late. Mr Boyle says that if colorectal cancer is
detected early, 95% of suﬀerers survive. Only 6% survive if the can-

cer reaches stage four. For many cancers, early detection is “our
greatest opportunity to improve survival,” says Mr Boyle.
Mr Boyle wants to detect cancer on the breath using an ion-mo-
bility spectrometer—a gadget that weighs chemicals by passing
them through an oscillating electric ﬁeld. The breath contains a
wide range of organic molecules that reﬂect what is going on in the
body’s metabolism. Cancers, which aﬀect the metabolism, should
in so doing change the pattern of molecules on the breath. Al-
though Owlstone’s system is very small—it ﬁts on a chip the size of
a coin—it is sensitive, identifying molecules at a level of a few parts
per billion. The ﬁrm hopes that when it has identiﬁed molecular
“ﬁngerprints” associated with particular cancers it will be able to
detect the disease earlier than other tests do. 
Improved diagnostics can do more than pick up cancers
sooner. They can also reveal the cancers’ weaknesses. Because
cancer drugs work in diﬀerent ways, some will do well against a
tumour with one set of mutations but one that has become cancer-
ous by some other pathway unscathed. Troy Cox, head of Founda-
tion Medicine, a diagnostics company based in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, says that in America 14 cancer drugs now have
“companion diagnostics”—tests that show whether a cancer is
likely to be susceptible to them or not. Ms Milley’s lung cancer, for
example, turned out to harbour a mutation which meant she
could be treated with a drug that targets that speciﬁc protein (see
next section).
So far, such genetic tests are used when planning therapy for
50% to 60% of solid tumours, according to Foundation. New drugs,
new understanding of cancer mechanisms and new technologies
that can scan many genes for mutations at once mean such testing
will be more informative in the near future. Many, including Eng-
land’s chief medical oﬃcer, Sally Davies, want cancer patients to
be routinely oﬀered genetic screening of their tumours. Founda-
tion and ThermoFisher, a diagnostics ﬁrm in Waltham, Massachu-
setts, are hoping to encourage this by oﬀering every gene of inter-
est on a mass-produced chip. Some of these mutations will help
doctors pick the best drugs for that particular cancer, others may
indicate how it is likely to develop. The tests would also identify
mutations for which there is not yet an approved therapy—but for
which there is one in clinical trials. 
David Hyman, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre
in New York, worked on a trial of an experimental drug, larotrecti-
nib, that was expected to work in cancers where a gene called
NTRK1 had undergone a speciﬁc mutation. Because that mutation
is found in less than 1% of all cancer patients, recruiting people to
the trial was a “Herculean eﬀort”, he says. It was worth it, though.
The drug was tested on 50 patients with 17 diﬀerent types of tu-
mour. In results published in June, 78% of patients with 12 diﬀerent
tumour types responded to the drug. 
Aside from picking the right drugs, genetic tests are also starting
to reveal more about the outcome and risks of any individual can-
cer—something that is useful for deciding whether a cancer needs

to be treated at all. The MammaPrint test, made by Agendia, based
in Amsterdam, analyses the activity of genes in early-stage breast
cancer. If women with early-stage breast cancer were routinely
tested in this way, those who will not need chemotherapy after
surgery could be picked out (a recent study of patients found 58%
to be in this category). A similar test is available for prostate cancer
from the ﬁrm Myriad Genetics, based in Salt Lake City, Utah. A re-
cent study suggests that people who have inherited a mutation in
the P53 tumour-suppressor gene might be well advised to have
whole-body MRI scans to screen for cancers, since their unsafe-
guarded cells are at particular risk. 
Identifying genes from tumours normally means retrieving
cancer cells via biopsies. This is invasive and often done only once
in the course of the disease. But cancers are both heterogeneous
and labile; elsewhere in a tumour, and later in a tumour’s progres-
sion, things may look diﬀerent.
These challenges are now being tackled with blood tests, a
technique termed “liquid biopsy”. Tumours shed DNA into the
blood, and these circulating fragments of DNA can be tested for
mutations. Regularly testing this DNA could be a way of keeping
track of a tumour’s mutations. The Institute for Cancer Research,
based in London, recently showed that it could use a liquid biopsy
to pick out whether a patient was likely to beneﬁt from a new type
of drug called a PARP inhibitor. Using liquid biopsies the research-
ers were able to ﬁnd out if the drug was doing any good in just four
to eight weeks. Liquid biopsies are also a promising technology for
the routine monitoring of patients who have been successfully
treated for cancer, lest their disease return. Mark Roschewski, a re-
searcher with America’s National Cancer Institute, the NCI, thinks
the technology could be “orders of magnitude more sensitive than
radiographic imaging”. 

Biopsies optimised
The big question for the ﬁrms developing these liquid biopsies is
whether the technology will also be suitable for the early-detec-
tion market that Mr Boyle is chasing with his breath tests. Guar-
dant Health, a ﬁrm based in Redwood City, California, currently
oﬀers a liquid biopsy that allows patients to obtain a genetic pro-
ﬁle of their tumour. It is using the data it gathers to look at the feasi-
bility of early detection. Helmy Eltoukhy of Guardant says the
ﬁrm is “agnostic” about the markers it seeks in the blood, meaning
that its researchers will not look just for DNA from tumours—if the
data suggest that RNA (a relative of DNA) or proteins provide the
telltale ﬁngerprint, then that is what they will look at. 
All diagnostic tests have to overcome two hurdles. They have
to be sensitive enough to identify those who have the disease cor-
rectly and also speciﬁc enough that they do not see signs of the dis-
ease when it isn’t actually present. The
more widely they are used, the more im-
portant that second requirement gets; false
positives are a pervasive problem with ex-
isting tests such as mammograms and PSA,
a test for prostate cancer. (This is why PSA
screening, while common in America, is
much less prevalent in Europe.) 
In liquid biopsies the challenge will be
to detect cancer-speciﬁc signals against a
noisy and confusing background. Barry
Kramer, director of the division of cancer
prevention at the NCI, warns that the same
marker can have diﬀerent functions in dif-
ferent organs. He notes that a programme
screening infants for neuroblastoma was
halted after it started to pick up too many
growths that did not merit clinical concern
and didn’t reduce the death rate. Speciﬁc-
ity, says Mr Eltoukhy, is early detection’s
Achilles’ heel. Others warn that liquid bi-

opsies aimed at DNA will never be sensitive enough for early de-
tection, because early tumours may shed very little DNA, or shed it
only occasionally; other molecules might prove more telling. 
Nonetheless, biotech is gung-ho about the idea. Grail, a liquid-
biopsy startup in Silicon Valley spun out of Illumina, a sequencing
ﬁrm, recently raised $900m. Earlier this year Guardant raised
$360m, and Alphabet invested $65m in Freenome, a San Francisco
startup with similar plans. Grail has begun a trial of its technology
which will enroll 120,000 women who are receiving mammo-
grams to see if its technology really does oﬀer early detection.
Whether it will make sense to adapt liquid biopsies to popula-
tion screening will depend on their costs—currently still too high
for widespread use—their sensitivity and, crucially, their false-pos-
itive rates. Unnecessary investigations after false positives are
both worrying and debilitating for patients and costly for the
health-care system. But some, such as Luis Diaz, an oncologist at
Memorial Sloan Kettering, argue that initial overdiagnosis is a nec-
essary part of moving ahead: “One never learns to ride a bike
without falling oﬀ.”
The costs and diﬃculties of blood screening are one of the
things that tiny Owlstone has going for it. Testing the breath for
metabolites doesn’t require the tumours to have started shedding
DNA. Britain’s NHS is running a £1.1m trial of the technology in pa-
tients suspected of having lung cancer who are also being exam-
ined by other means. If this ﬁnds the technology to be reliable it
might be expanded for use in population screening. In July Owl-
stone said it would collaborate with academic partners to see if
breath biopsies could be expanded to pick up bladder, breast, kid-
ney, pancreatic, prostate, brain, and head and neck cancers. 
There is no question that blood biopsies will be at the heart of
the future of tracking and proﬁling tumours. But for early detec-
tion other options might yet win out; success will not hinge on
which company starts with the most money but which oﬀers the
biggest bang for the buck. Health-care systems will seek to adopt
technologies that work at scale. The beneﬁt will be that more can-
cers can be cured with the most basic, oldest and most eﬀective
methods of cancer treatment. 7

Molecular medicine

Progression, and how
to stop it

Surger y, radiotherapy and cancer drugs are all becoming
more tightly focused

MS MILLEY’S primary tumour was in the middle lobe
of her right lung, which surgeons removed entirely.
Surgery is an ancient form of cancer treatment and
still a common one. Today’s surgeons have every-
thing from lasers to cryosurgery—the freezing of ab-
normal tissue—at their disposal. By and large, they
use this expanding range of tools to cut out less and less. Ultra-
sound, magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray tomography
and positron-emission tomography (PET) scans have between
them eliminated much of the need for “exploratory surgery” to
understand the scope of a cancer. 
Often surgery goes hand-in-hand with radiation therapy. Soon
after the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century it be-
came clear that radiation which killed cells could be used as a can-
cer therapy. In its early days practitioners judged the correct dose
by trying their machines out on their own arms, looking for a pink
reaction on their skin. Many went on to develop leukaemia.

6

Today radiotherapy is considerably safer for its practitioners
and more beneﬁcial to its recipients. After a cancer is cut out, radia-
tion is frequently used to kill the cancer cells the surgeon’s knife
has missed. It is also sometimes used to destroy the tumours
themselves, particularly in places where surgery would be hard.
In rich countries about half of patients with localised cancers re-
ceive radiotherapy. Two out of ﬁve of those treated for cancer and
cured in Britain will have had treatment which consisted of radio-
therapy either alone or in part. Breast and prostate cancers re-
spond well to it. 
To make all this possible, medical physicists produce beams of
X-rays, gamma radiation, neutrons and, increasingly, protons;
they have ever more sophisticated ways of ensuring that these
cell-damaging energies are delivered to the tumours being target-
ed, rather than to healthy tissue nearby. Ms Milley experienced
this when she had a superﬁcial brain metastasis dealt with by ste-
reotactic radio-surgery. The procedure uses 3D imaging to deter-
mine the exact location of a tumour, at which point a number of
diﬀerent beams are focused on it from various directions (see dia-
gram on next page). The idea is that only in the part of the brain
where all the beams cross is the dose high enough to kill cells—the
individual beams, on their way in and out, do comparatively little
damage. The idea is to match the extent of the lethal criss-crossing
as closely as possible to the location of the tumour. It is a way of
achieving what Emma Harris, a medical physicist with the Insti-
tute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London, calls the current state of
the art: “Shaping the beam and varying the intensity of the radia-
tion dose to create exquisite volumes of radiation.”
Proton therapy oﬀers another way to deal death to tumours
while sparing the surrounding tissues. By choosing the right ener-
gy for the beam physicists can determine how deep into the tissue
it will get before doing most of its damage. This speciﬁcity is seen
as particularly useful in tumours that are near eyes, brains and spi-
nal cords. 
Radiation can also be emitted inside the body; radioactive pel-
lets and seeds can be put right where they are needed. A new ver-
sion of this approach is being developed by Nanobiotix, a biotech
ﬁrm based in Paris, which is developing nanoparticles containing
hafnium oxide which generate electrons when exposed to X-rays.
When these nanoparticles are injected into tumours that are then
zapped with X-rays they increase the damage done. 
As well as surgery on the lung and radiation treatment for the
tumour in her brain, Ms Milley also had chemotherapy—the third
of the 20th century’s medical responses to cancer. She was given a
cocktail of cisplatin, a drug containing platinum that was ap-

proved in 1978, and Alimta (pemetrexed). 
Chemotherapy’s origins can be traced
back to the development of chemical
weapons in the ﬁrst world war. Looking
into the records of soldiers aﬀected by
mustard gas, two doctors at Yale Universi-
ty, Louis Goodman and Alfred Gilman, no-
ticed that many were short of white blood
cells. They wondered if this meant that
cancers in which white blood cells prolifer-
ate—lymphomas—might be treated with
something similar. The ﬁrst patient to re-
ceive this treatment was a man with ad-
vanced lymphoma who is known today
by the initials “J.D.”. His symptoms were
greatly relieved. 
The treatment worked because mustard gas damages cells’
DNA, stopping cell division. These eﬀects are not speciﬁc to cancer
cells; but because cancer cells divide a lot, such poisons are partic-
ularly bad for them. In 1947 aminopterin, a chemical which
messes up cell division by interrupting the metabolism of folic
acid, was found to produce remissions in children with acute leu-
kaemia. This drug was a precursor to methotrexate, a treatment
which provided the ﬁrst cures of a metastatic cancer in 1956 and is
still commonly used today. By the 1960s, chemotherapy had in-
duced long-term remissions, and even cures, of Hodgkin disease,
a lymphoma, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
Cures of testicular cancer arrived in the 1970s. Though few cancers
can be cured with chemotherapy on its own, many can be set back
a long way and controlled for quite some time. Chemotherapies,
like radiation therapies, are often used to mop up the cancer left
over when primary tumours have been excised.

ciﬁc than older chemotherapies. Rituxan
(rituximab), an antibody which targets a
protein on the surface of the immune sys-
tem’s B-cells that misbehaves in B-cell non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, was approved 20
years ago, in 1997. Other early targeted ther-
apies that blocked growth signals in diﬀer-
ent cancers included Herceptin (trastuzu-
mab) and Erbitux (cetuximab), which are
both antibodies, and Iressa (geﬁtinib) and
Gleevec (imatinib), which are smaller mol-
ecules like Tarceva. These drugs trans-
formed the treatment of many cancers.
Herceptin, for example, dramatically al-
tered the outcome of breast cancer in pa-
tients with the HER2 mutation. With Her-
ceptin as part of a two-drug therapy, a woman diagnosed with the
metastatic form of the disease can hope to survive for almost ﬁve
years; previously it was 20 months. 
Another promising targeted approach involved aiming drugs
at the creation of new blood vessels. If tumours are to grow be-
yond a few millimetres in size they need to encourage new blood
vessels to bring them nutrients. Drugs which inhibit this process
arrived in 2004 with Avastin (bevacizumab). It is currently used to
treat advanced colorectal, kidney and lung cancers. 
A third approach attacks DNA repair systems. Losing some of
the ability to repair DNA helps cancers accumulate mutations, and
is often part of how they get started. But the cancers need to keep
some residual DNA repair functions; otherwise the cells will sim-
ply die. Thus cancers that have mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2
genes rely heavily on a backup DNA repair mechanism which
uses proteins called poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). Now
targeted drugs have been designed to inhibit this repair mecha-
nism. In its absence, massive genetic damage drives cancer cells to
their death. Some of these PARP inhibitors have been shown to
help in BRCA-linked breast cancers, and there are promising re-
sults in ovarian cancer. They seem also to have promise in some
prostate and pancreatic cancers. 
Finding targets for such therapies has been made far easier by
the sequencing of the human genome and the remarkable reduc-
tions in the cost of sequencing DNA which followed on from it.
With a baseline genome for comparison, identifying the muta-
tions in cancers became much easier. Once found, these genes can
be used to understand the molecular workings of the disease and,
in theory, to ﬁnd new targets for drug developers. 

Imperfect chemistries
Mike Stratton, director of the Sanger Institute, set up its cancer-ge-
nome project in 2000, when sequencing was still a comparatively
arduous business. They were interested in looking at mutations of
40 diﬀerent genes, but practical limitations meant they could only
start working on 20. The third gene they looked at was BRAF; se-
quencing the genes from 500 cancers the researchers found that
there were BRAF mutants putting yet another cell-growth-signal-
ling pathway into overdrive in half or more of the malignant mela-
nomas in their sample. By 2011 the ﬁrst BRAF inhibitor, Zelboraf
(vemurafenib), was approved for the treatment of melanoma. In a
trial, the six-month survival was 84%, compared with 64% who
were treated with chemotherapy. The drug was quite toxic—de-
spite their targeting, such drugs do have side-eﬀects—but it was still
approved for use. 
Hundreds of thousands of cancers have now been sequenced,
and the hunt for targets is seeing diminishing returns. Though
there are hundreds of genes that go wrong in cancers, only a limit-
ed number promote cancer development and are common to a
number of cancers. A signiﬁcant amount of work is now focused
not on ﬁnding new targets but on second-generation drugs aimed
at targets that have already proved vulnerable; these newer drugs

Elective aﬃnities
One problem with chemotherapy is that cancers can become re-
sistant to it. Most cancers are genetically heterogeneous, because
the cells accumulate new mutations as they grow. Some of these
mutations can make the cells less susceptible to the chemothera-
py. As treatment continues, such cells become more numerous,
and as they divide they go on to accumulate mutations that make
them even more resistant—the cancer evolves resistance to che-
motherapy rather as an infection can evolve resistance to antibiot-
ics. This is why chemotherapies are now often used in combina-
tion; it is harder to evolve resistance to two or three drugs at the
same time. 
Another problem with chemotherapy is that it attacks cells that
are dividing for perfectly legitimate non-cancerous reasons, too.
Hence the side-eﬀects, which include fatigue, hair loss, mood
changes and nausea. The severity of the eﬀects vary greatly from
person to person, and some, such as nausea, can be treated with
secondary drugs under some circumstances. But some chemo-
therapies can have long-term side-eﬀects, damaging the heart, the
nerves and fertility. 
Before taking on her chemotherapy, though, Ms Milley was giv-
en another treatment: Tarceva (erlotinib). Tarceva is a small mole-
cule which disrupts signals transmitted by a protein called the epi-
dermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR). At least eight mutations
that cause the EGFR to be constantly active have been tied to lung
cancer, and Ms Milley had one of them. Her course of Tarceva saw
all the tiny tumours across her body shrink, one by 60%. She went
back to work. 
A key tool for targeting cancer-speciﬁc pathways and mole-
cules is the antibody. Antibodies are proteins made by the im-
mune system which stick to a particular bit—the “antigen”—of a
particular molecule. Turning them into mass-produced drugs has
been one of the biotech industry’s triumphs. In the 1990s they
started to come into use as cancer therapies. Aimed at antigens
that crop up on cancers, but not other cells, they are far more spe-

aim for higher eﬃcacy, lower side eﬀects or, ideally, both. There are
also ways to combine the speciﬁcity of antibodies aimed at a well
characterised target with other forms of treatment—to bind the
antibody to something poisonous, say, or to something radioac-
tive, and use it as an address label.
But there are still new targets being hit for the ﬁrst time. In 2016,
the drug Xalkori (crizotinib) was approved for ROS1-positive lung
cancer. Louis Staudt, director of the centre for cancer genomics at
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, Maryland, says
about 1-3% of cases of lung cancer are driven by a ROS1 mutation.
Dr Staudt is working on a repository for genomic information
called the NCI Genomic Data Commons, which hopes to identify
more low-frequency drivers of cancer. 
These targeted therapies are changing the way the doctors and
regulators look at cancer. Typically cancers have been classiﬁed ac-
cording to where they occur and how they behave. Now they can
also be classiﬁed according to which genes are going wrong in
them. This allows new sorts of investigation such as the NCI’s
MATCH trial, which matches patients to treatments based on the
genetic changes in their tumours. More than 6,000 patients
treated at more than 1,000 institutions have had their tumours se-
quenced as part of this trial. The large numbers are needed to pick
out the rare mutations that drive cancers. 

By their genes shall you know them
A milestone in the transition to a genomic era for cancer therapy
was reached earlier this year when America’s Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) approved a treatment based on a speciﬁc ge-
netic indicator rather than the type of tumour, as determined by
location and its tissue structure. A similar “biomarker”-based ap-
proval is expected soon for a drug which targets a defect in a family
of signalling proteins called tropomyosin receptor kinases, pro-
teins which play an important role in tumour growth. A rare muta-
tion (it aﬀects only about 1% of patients) sees the genes that code
for TRKs become fused to other genes. Loxo Oncology, a biotech-
nology ﬁrm in Stamford, Connecticut, has developed a drug
aimed at this aberration; the idea is that it should be licensed for
use in anyone with the relevant mutation.
Targeted therapies mark a signiﬁcant advance over, and addi-
tion to, older chemotherapies. But they share their familiar weak-
nesses. In the 2000s Olivia Rossanese, a researcher at the ICR,
worked on a BRAF inhibitor at the British pharma ﬁrm GSK. She
says: “We made a drug to it, we said patients with this mutation
are going to respond and that happened. It was a beautiful story
…right up until resistance.” To cancers, targeted therapies, includ-
ing antibodies, are another constraint to evolve around, and in the
end that is what they tend to do. 
For 13 months Ms Milley responded
wonderfully to Tarceva. Then her doctor at
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
noticed spots on her adrenal glands that in-
dicated resistance. That was the point at
which she started cisplatin chemotherapy.
It worked for eight months. When it started
to falter, she went back on to the Tarceva,
which worked for another four months.
That looked like the end of the road for ap-
proved treatments. The only remaining op-
tion seemed to be to take a chance with a
clinical trial, and this she agreed to do. 
In the middle of October 2015 her doc-
tor called unexpectedly. She was not eligi-
ble for the trial she had been trying to en-
roll in. But the FDA had just approved a
brand new drug for lung cancer: Keytruda
(pembrolizumab). It was one of a very pro-
mising new class of treatment known as
immunotherapies. 7

Loosening inhibitions

Immunity, and how to
encourage it

Medicine has ﬁnally ﬁgured out how to get the immune
system to ﬁght cancer

T HAT infections could sometimes cause a cancer to re-
treat, or even vanish, was known well before the advent
of modern medicine. Imhotep, a pharaoh, recommend-
ed treating a tumour with a poultice followed by an in-
cision—something that would help an infection devel-
op. In early modern Europe doctors used septic
dressings on tumours with ulcers and deliberately created puru-
lent sores. By the end of the 19th century, William Coley, a bone
surgeon in New York, was methodically infecting patients with
Streptococcus bacteria. 
Coley’s work fell out of favour, partly thanks to the rise of radia-
tion therapy. Many continued to cling to the idea that the immune
system might in some circumstances be provoked into recognis-
ing, attacking and subduing a cancer; they just didn’t know how to
provide the provocation. In 1976 this latent belief in the potential
of “immunotherapy” blossomed into hope with the discovery of
interleukin 2 (IL-2). IL-2 is a growth factor that encourages the pro-
duction of T-cells, white blood cells that scan the body for unwant-
ed invaders and, on ﬁnding them, activate other parts of the im-
mune system, including the B-cells which produce antibodies. 
But IL-2 was a false dawn. On its own, it activated the immune
system indiscriminately, and the immune system is a powerful
beast; Elad Sharon, at the National Cancer Institute’s division of
treatment and diagnosis, says the eﬀects were “toxic and messy,
and frequently sent patients to the ICU.” That might have been
more tolerable in a drug that delivered. But to general surprise and
discouragement IL-2 cured only a few patients of metastatic can-
cers. It was not clear why the treatment was not more eﬀective.
Answers started to arrive in the 1990s. James Allison, at the
Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berke-
ley, began work on a protein called CTLA-4 on the surface of some
T-cells. By 1996 he had shown that this protein put a brake on the
immune response to cancer. Blocking CTLA-4 with an antibody re-
moved the brake; the immune system activated itself and got to
work. Tumours in mice vanished when the animals were given
CTLA-4-blocking antibodies. Though it was not immediately obvi-
ous, in retrospect this came to be seen as one of the reasons IL-2
never really worked: it is not possible to make a car run faster if its
brakes are jammed on. 
At the time oncologists were unimpressed by Dr Allison’s re-
sults. Cancer had been cured in mice many times over. And after
many failed trials, immunotherapy was in exile—banished to the
small corners of the big oncology meetings. But in 1999 Tasuku
Honjo of the University of Kyoto, in Japan, showed that the gene
for a protein called PD-1 also seemed to tamp down the immune
system. When this gene was switched oﬀ in mice, some devel-
oped autoimmune diseases—a sign of an immune system in over-
drive. In collaboration with Arlene Sharpe and Gordon Freeman
at Harvard, Dr Honjo showed that some cancer cells had a second
protein called PD-L1 on their surfaces which, by interacting with
the PD-1 on T-cells, protected the cancer from them. Dr Honjo re-
members approaching many companies with the ﬁnding, but
“none wanted to invest.” 
Despite a general wariness on the part of pharma companies,
though, a trickle of development on therapies aimed at CTLA-4
and PD-1 did begin. Then, in 2010, Bristol-Myers Squibb released
results from a trial of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, Yervoy (ipilimu-

counterpart, PD-L1, on its surface, T-cells
will ignore the cell despite any suspicious
antigens it may be carrying (see diagram).
MK-3475 seemed to block the interaction
nicely. It might thus render the immune
system blind to the cancer’s subterfuge.
“Whatever [else] you are doing, stop,” Perl-
mutter
told his
clinical-development
group. Merck expanded a phase 1 trial pro-
gramme looking at the drug’s eﬀect on ad-
vanced melanoma to more than 1,200 pa-
tients, making it the largest phase 1 trial in
the history of oncology. 
The expansion was in part a response to
a new discovery: early evidence suggested
that checkpoint inhibitors could also get re-
sults with lung cancers, which are a much
bigger killer than, and thus represent a much larger market than,
malignant melanomas. Luis Diaz, head of solid-tumour oncology
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York, re-
calls: “It was completely unexpected. Prior to that I was not a be-
liever in immunotherapy.”

Whispers of a cure
Merck’s PD-1 drug would eventually be given the commercial
name Keytruda (pembrolizumab). In 2014 it became the second
checkpoint inhibitor to be approved in America—the world’s larg-
est and most lucrative pharmaceutical market. Opdivo (nivolu-
mab), a PD-1 drug which Ono Pharmaceuticals had developed on
the basis of Dr Honjo’s work, soon joined it, having been licensed
in Japan a little earlier. In some cases the drug produced eﬀects lit-
tle short of miraculous. In 2016 it was announced that it had
cleared former president Jimmy Carter of metastatic melanoma
that had spread to his liver and brain. 
In lung cancer, and in many other cancers, the patients who re-
sponded tended to have a higher mutational burden, like that seen
in melanoma. More antigens means more targets for the immune
system to tackle when the drug lets it oﬀ the leash. This observa-
tion provided a way to spot some of the patients most likely to
beneﬁt. In 2017 Keytruda was approved for use in any cancer that
has mismatch-repair-gene defects, a ﬂaw which means that a can-
cer accumulates even more mutations—and thus more possible
antigens—than most. 
Another indicator that the drug may have something to oﬀer is
the tumours’ expression of PD-L1. Tumours expressing a lot of
PD-L1 are investing in keeping the immune system duped; when
the PD-1 system is interrupted they should prove particularly vul-
nerable. At the start of October 2015, Keytruda was approved for
use in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in cases where other
treatments had failed and when there was PD-L1 on more than
50% of the tumour cells. Ms Milley’s score was 80%, and she start-
ed treatment almost immediately.

mab), in malignant melanoma. Compared with the state of the
art, they were fantastic. It was the ﬁrst drug shown to change sur-
vival in this devastating disease, raising the median to ten months.
Some survived much longer.
What was going on? Because the immune system is such a
powerful beast, evolution has equipped it with a system of checks
and balances lest it get out of hand. Both CTLA-4 and PD-1 are parts
of that system. When one sort of immune cell presents an antigen
which it has picked up to another, the second cell will ignore it if, at
the same time, the ﬁrst cell stimulates the CTLA-4 receptor. If the
CTLA-4 receptor is blocked with an antibody like Yervoy, though,
this “checkpoint” system does not work. Unchecked, the immune
system is able to react to a wider range of antigens—including tu-
mour antigens. Freed up by Yervoy the body’s T-cells started
attacking the melanomas. And, it turned out, kept on attacking
them. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the new “check-
point inhibitor” was that a small subset of patients survived for
year after year. 
Despite indications of success with melanomas, many scien-
tists thought the checkpoint-inhibitor mechanism would not be
broadly eﬀective. Melanomas accumulate a very large array of
mutations, and are thus more likely than most cancers to display
antigens which trigger an immune response. This argument was
bolstered by the observation that melanomas are more likely than
other cancers to be subject to spontaneous remissions—presum-
ably because something else kicks the immune system into gear.
What was more, Yervoy had serious, sometimes life-threatening
side-eﬀects. 
Pessimists have a pretty good record when it comes to cancer
prognostication. But this time they were wrong. At Merck Roger
Perlmutter, an immunologist who had previously left the com-
pany, was brought back to run the research labs. He became very
interested in a PD-1-blocker then known only as MK-3475. Unlike
CTLA-4, which works higher up the immune system’s chain of
command, PD-1 has a front-line role; if a cancer cell carries PD-1’s

Jedd Wolchok, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Ketter-
ing, says immunotherapies do not have the same kinds of impact
as other types of cancer therapy. In some cases they do not work at
all. In other cases they can either eliminate the cancer entirely, or
cause it to stabilise, or regress. Responses to therapy are often lon-
ger lasting than those seen in targeted drugs. And they tend to per-
sist after patients stop taking the drug (at present CTLA-4 drugs are
usually administered for only a matter of months).
The nature of the long-lasting responses is intriguing. Dr Wol-
chok has patients who started treatment for malignant melanoma
eight years ago. He ﬁnds it particularly interesting that in some
cases scans of the cancers taken before treatment (when the prog-
nosis for the patients would have been six or seven months) and
scans taken today look more or less equally dreadful. Biopsies of
the tumours reveal a lot of immune cells and a lot of dead tumour
cells. Dr Wolchok says it looks like a “chronic struggle between a
patient’s immune system and cancer”. This apparent equilibrium

is quite diﬀerent from what is seen in chemotherapy, where the
cancer will be either susceptible or resistant. The diﬀerence seems
to be due at least in part to the fact that the immune response, like
the cancer, can evolve.
Though immunotherapy is still new, it has already radically
shifted the treatment and research landscape. A wide range of
combinations is being tested in the hope of improving patients’ re-
sponses. A trial combining Opdivo and Yervoy in malignant mela-
noma has shown tumours to shrink in 60% to 70% of patients (al-
though it causes serious side-eﬀects). Dr Wolchok says it is not yet
possible to calculate the median survival time in the trial popula-
tion—because more than half of the patients are still alive. 
Compared with the more limited range of patients that can be
treated with most targeted therapies, immunotherapies seem to
work in many cancers. And as Dr Sharon at the NCI points out, it
also produces cures. But this excitement needs to be tempered
with the grittier reality that, across all cancers tried so far, only

Meeting the unmet burden

Much of the world has yet to see progress on cancer

products (sometimes taking as much as
40% of the market) and many of the
products being sold would never be
approved by a stringent regulator. 
The ACS and IBM have been working
on ways to predict the number of cancer
cases countries can expect to see. That
should allow drugs to be ordered in bulk
at wholesale prices from reliable suppli-
ers. The ACS is also helping countries
redraft their guidelines for treating cancer
so that they match the locally available
treatments. 
The eﬀort extends to private pharma-
cies. At the moment their incentives
encourage them to buy either the pro-
ducts with the highest margins or those
that sell for the least. The charity is devel-

MEG O’BRIEN, the director of global
cancer treatment at the American Cancer
Society (ACS), ﬁrst went to Africa some 15
years ago to work on HIV. She has thus
seen at ﬁrst hand how advanced treat-
ments can make a diﬀerence to deadly
diseases in poor countries. Now she
wants to see the same done for cancer.
But it is an uphill struggle. 
It is not just that the resources needed
are not there. Nor is the hope. “Nobody in
Africa knows anyone who survives
cancer,” she says. “It is considered 100%
fatal and is associated with so much
suﬀering.” This means that the idea of
getting tested for cancer when symptoms
are spotted is a hard sell. Indeed, accord-
ing to Dr O’Brien, there is more stigma
around cancer in parts of Africa than
there is around AIDS.
Working with IBM, the multinational
technology ﬁrm, Dr O’Brien has been
trying to improve the availability of
cancer treatments in sub-Saharan Africa.
She says the biggest barrier is that the
market for pharmaceuticals functions so
poorly because of a set of interlocking
problems—what she calls a “twelve-part
equation”. 
Because there is very little cancer
treatment at present the agencies which
procure medicines are unfamiliar with
the cancer treatments they might want;
their interests have mostly been focused
on infectious disease. The pharma com-
panies, for their part, neglect the market
because of the low volumes—low vol-
umes which mean that the procuring
agencies pay higher prices than they
should for old, oﬀ-patent drugs. Coun-
tries are often inundated by counterfeit

10

oping a tool called “chemo ﬁnder” that
doctors can use to ﬁnd pharmacies that
have high-quality products at competitive
prices. Dr O’Brien hopes that this tool will
encourage pharmacies to bring in the
products that the doctors most need. 
In Uganda another innovation is to
create partnerships between cancer-care
centres and experts abroad who can diag-
nose pathology slides that have been
uploaded into the cloud. 
Such progress is urgently needed,
because the number of patients with
cancer in low- and middle-income coun-
tries is rising rapidly. BIO Ventures for
Global Health (BVGH), a non-proﬁt organi-
sation based in Seattle, Washington, notes
that 60% more Africans die from cancer
than succumb to malaria. A white paper
from BVGH says that over 20% of African
countries have no access to cancer treat-
ments at all and most cancers are diag-
nosed at an advanced stage. The ﬁve-year
breast cancer survival rate in the Gambia
is 12%, compared with 90% in America.
The number of deaths is rising at an alarm-
ing rate, thanks to ageing and the spread of
Western lifestyles. In some countries the
proportion of the population that smokes
tobacco is growing as people get richer. 
Many African countries have rapidly
growing economies. They already spend
money on cancer treatments and could
spend more—but they need to do so eﬀec-
tively. Dr O’Brien’s emphasis is to make
sure people who arrive at cancer centres
get a decent level of treatment. “Right now
we have more patients waiting for treat-
ment than we have treatments,” she says.
“One of the ﬁrst things we need to do is get
drugs on the ground.”

2 about 20% respond to the new approach. The response varies
greatly between types of cancer. In patients who have failed the
usual treatments for Hodgkin’s lymphoma it is 90%. In pancreatic
and most colorectal cancers it is basically zero. 
Improving this response is perhaps today’s biggest oncological
challenge—the source of more excitement, and investment, than
any other recent development in the ﬁeld. Part of the answer will
come from a better understanding of the steps needed to generate
an anti-tumour response from the immune system, and of the
therapeutic targets available. For example, Hervé Hoppenot, the
boss of biotech ﬁrm Incyte, a biotech ﬁrm based in Wilmington,
Delaware, says that some tumours protect themselves from the
immune system using another checkpoint, IDO1 (an enzyme that
was ﬁrst discovered in a search for ways to protect a fetus from im-
mune rejection). Incyte is testing epacadostat, an existing drug
known to inhibit IDO1, as a cancer treatment both alone and in
combination with PD-1 blockers. 
There are well over 1,000 clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors
going on; what was at ﬁrst a trickle, then a current, is now a torrent.
Some worry that things have gone too far too fast. Jeﬀ Bluestone,
who runs the new Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy in
San Francisco, says “many of [these trials] are based on minimal
data and very limited clinical evidence about what combination
will work”. Some fear there are too few patients to allow these
trials to be run, others that there is too little thought and planning
and a lot of duplication of eﬀort. Dr Freeman at Harvard says he
has been told there are over 80 Chinese groups developing diﬀer-
ent PD-1 antibodies. 
This enthusiasm may lead to wasted eﬀorts, and even delay
progress. But there is no doubt that immunotherapy will from
here on be a key part of treatment for a growing number of can-
cers. Perhaps the most telling measure of its success is that some
oncologists have started to complain, quietly, of a shortage of spe-
cialist doctors. Patients keep coming back instead of dying. 7

Building on success

The future, and how to
get there

There is a lot more for immunotherapy to do

I MMUNOTHERAPY oﬀers huge promise, both as an addi-
tion to established therapies and as a foundation for future
ones. Hundreds of trials are pairing CTLA-4, PD-1 or PD-L1
inhibitors with chemotherapy, radiation and targeted ther-
apies. One hope is that the older treatments will increase
the range of antigens that the cancer oﬀers for the immune
system to latch on to, both by driving further mutations and by
killing cancer cells. Dead cells release more antigens,
Then there is the development of further immunotherapies,
which is being pursued both by building on the successes of the
ﬁrst checkpoint inhibitors and by using entirely new technologies,
such as genome editing. Dr Wolchok at Memorial Sloan Kettering
is working on the next generation of immune-modulators. These
include new inhibitory compounds for IDO and TIM-3, another
checkpoint. Some researchers are trying to remove further brakes
on the system by killing or silencing some of its regulatory cells.
Others are looking at molecules which activate the immune sys-
tem in a similar way to IL-2. Nektar Therapeutics, a biotech ﬁrm
based in San Francisco, is developing an engineered therapy
which does this in a way that should, in principle, encourage tu-

mour-killing T-cells. It is being tested as a combination treatment
with an anti-PD-1 drug in ﬁve tumour types, including bladder
cancer and a hard-to-treat form of breast cancer. 
Other approaches seek to make sure that the immune system
responds to as many cancer antigens as possible. Viruses geneti-
cally engineered to attack cancer cells might be used to this end.
Even if such viruses did not kill enough cells to do the cancer much
damage, the way in which they kill the cells would release other-
wise hard-to-detect antigens that might help the immune system
target the tumour better. 
Alternatively, the antigens could be provided from outside.
Now that immunotherapies have wind in their sails, various old
ideas are coming back into vogue. One of them is vaccination. The
vaccines with which people are familiar are those against infec-
tious disease. They work by priming the immune system to re-
spond to an antigen associated with a speciﬁc pathogen, so that
when the system encounters the infection for real it already
knows how to ﬁght it. Because some infections can lead to cancer,
some of these vaccinations can prevent it. Sometimes, as in vacci-
nation against hepatitis B, which can cause liver cancer, this is an
added bonus. Sometimes, as in vaccination against human papil-
loma virus, which can cause cervical cancer, it is the main point. 
But there may be another way to use vaccines against cancer.
Equipped with the right antigen, a vaccine might encourage an im-
mune response to a tumour which is already present, but which
the immune system has failed to get to grips with. It is an approach
that has been frequently tried in the past, and has repeatedly
failed. But the availability of checkpoint inhibitors and the ability
to pick out the most promising antigens may allow this form of tar-
geting to come into its own. 
Neon Therapeutics, Gritstone Oncolo-
gy, Genocea Biosciences and other biotech
ﬁrms are all pursuing the creation of perso-
nalised vaccines based on the mutations in
an individual tumour. The trick is to ﬁnd
which of the novel antigens its genome
says the tumour might be churning out are
the most likely to provoke a strong re-
sponse when served up to the immune
system in the form of a vaccine. Jill O’Don-
nell-Tormey at the Cancer Research Insti-
tute (CRI), a non-proﬁt in New York that
concentrates on immunotherapies, says
that everyone has their favourite algo-
rithm to predict which antigens will get the
best response. Together with the Parker In-
stitute in San Francisco, CRI is creating a
“bake oﬀ” where these algorithms will be
tested against each other.

ﬁrst—there might be scope for bringing
them in sooner, at least in some cancers. In
decades to come it is possible to imagine
an approach where a tailored vaccine
might be the ﬁrst—and, ideally, the only—
response to a blood test showing the pres-
ence of a cancer. 

Reprogramming the genome
Like immunotherapies, vaccines oﬀer a
way to hack the immune system by chang-
ing the way that its cells ﬁght the cancer
and increasing the number of them doing
so. A less circuitous way of doing this is
now on oﬀer: reprogram the immune sys-
tem directly. Take some of its cells out of the
body, manipulate them so that they do
what you want, encourage them to divide
and multiply, then put them back and let
them get on with the job.
The technology along these lines that
has got furthest is called CAR-T, where CAR
stands for “Chimeric antigen receptor”.
These CARs are produced by splicing to-
gether the gene for an antibody that recog-
nises a tumour antigen and the gene for a
receptor that sits on the surface of the T-cells; put this new gene
into a T-cell and it will be precisely targeted at the tumour. The
small clinical trials undertaken to date suggest that this could be
extremely eﬀective. A trial of 31 patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia brought a complete, and unprecedented, remission in
93% of cases. A CAR-T therapy called Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel),
made by the Swiss ﬁrm Novartis to treat B-cell acute lymphoblas-
tic leukaemia, was approved for use in America on August 30th. 
There are two main limitations to CAR-T. One is that so far the
T-cells have been programmed to target a molecule, CD19, which is
only common to the surface of a few blood cancers. The other is
that CAR-T has been known to trigger immune reactions which
can prove fatal. Neither problem is obviously insoluble. Editing
genes has been made much easier by a new technology known as
CRISPR-Cas9, which has already been used to improve the way
that CAR-T cells are engineered in mice. It may well eventually al-
low the receptors used in such therapies to be personalised to the
speciﬁcs of the patient’s cancer. And more precision, as well as ex-
perience, should lead to immune responses less likely to run away
with themselves.
What such advances will not do, though, is make such treat-
ments cheaper. Novartis’s new therapy costs $475,000. Genome-
editing treatments seem likely to be the most expensive cancer
treatments the world has yet seen. And that is saying quite a lot,
since many of the newer cancer treatments are eye-wateringly
pricey (see chart on previous page). 
There are various reasons for this. More sophisticated R&D
costs a lot. And antibodies are much more expensive to make than
the smaller molecules used in older therapies. Generic versions of
them are still few and far between. A company than can make
antibodies which pass regulatory muster is much better advised
to make ones it can sell for a premium. 
But the overwhelming factor is that in America, the world’s
largest market for drugs, prices are set by what the market will
bear. When life-saving drugs are available from only one or two
providers high prices are a given. This is why pharma companies
have piled into oncology over the past decade. They see a market
which, by 2025, is forecast to be worth $45bn-100bn a year. 
Not all progress is expensive. Eﬀective early diagnostics could
save both money and suﬀering. The knowledge gained from
blood biopsies should allow doctors to tailor treatments better,
and avoid drugs that will not work on a given patient. And in a dif-

ferent economic setting bespoke vaccines,
gene-editing treatments and the like could
in times to come short-circuit rising prices.
Molecules made inside the body by repro-
grammed cells should be cheaper than
those made in expensive cultures. Cutting
and splicing the genome could be a great
deal cheaper than using scalpels and lasers
on the body. 
But in the world as it is new cancer ther-
apies will continue to be among the most
expensive interventions medicine has to
oﬀer, creating a challenge for health sys-
tems around the world. And some will dis-
appoint. The immune system’s complexity
means that it will not always react as doc-
tors hope. Some treatments will prove less
eﬀective than at ﬁrst they seemed. This is a
particular problem for cancer drugs, which
tend to be approved after comparatively
small trials. A recent study of 36 drugs ap-
proved between 2008 and 2012 found that
18 did not help patients to live longer. The
price of these drugs ranged from $20,000
to almost $170,000 per patient.
The incidence of cancer will continue
to be dominated by demographics. In developed countries, new
therapies may not reduce the chances of getting cancer for some
time, simply because older people get more cancers. But the
chances of surviving your ﬁrst cancer, or your next cancer, will im-
prove—and for those with more amenable cancers, and access to
the best treatment, they may do so quite quickly. Ever more people
will still be told, “I’m afraid you have cancer.” But the words will
become less fateful, the diagnosis ever less feared.

The cost of progress
When Ms Milley was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer, she
went on to Google and read the words “death sentence”. It is, alas,
fairly typical for patients with terminal cancer to have little idea
about their prognosis unless they seek it out. Many might be better
served by more openness. 
But prognosis is not destiny.
Ms Milley started taking Key-
truda in December 2015. After
two months of treatment her le-
sions had almost entirely van-
ished. So far, they have mounted
no comeback, and she continues
to feel well. She ﬁnds the re-
sponse “amazing”. 
On any given drug, in any giv-
en trial, most people will not be
as fortunate. But one of the
strange consolations of the cur-
rent progress being made against
cancer is that modern biomedi-
cine makes it possible to learn
more from failure than ever be-
fore. Huge amounts of
the
knowledge now saving lives was
gained from dead and dying pa-
tients, loved ones and friends
who lost their ﬁght for life but left
a legacy of data. In any given
case, that is scant recompense.
Put those contributions together,

Backin hishardscrabbletown ofZajecar, in eastern Serbia, there arehardlyanyjobsand even ifhe could ﬁndone, he reckonshe would earn onlyaround €180 a month. ButSlovakia’sboomingfactoriesare desperate forlabour,and theyare turningto Serbia to ﬁnd it. Serbia and Slovakia have old historicalties. Theirlanguagesand culture are close.Two ofcentral Bratislava’sstreetsarenamed afterSerbian heroes. And so thenumberofSerbscomingto workin Slova-kia hasbeen climbingsince 2015. In Julytheregistered numberwas9,363. Thoughsmall, thatwasa 61% increase since Janu-ary. The numberwill onlyrise, saysMirol-savKralik, the presidentofthe Slovak-Ser-bian ChamberofCommerce. TinySlovakia, with a population of just5m, isshortofatleast80,000 workers, saysMrKralik. Otherssaythe shortfall is muchlarger. Since Slovakia isa full member ofthe European Union, Slovakscan easily gooﬀto GermanyorAustria and workthereforfarmore than theycould earn athome.Since Serbia isnotin the EU, itsworkerscannoteasilydo likewise. So manySerbsworkin Slovakia on 90-daypermitsar-ranged byagencies. An unknown numbermore do so illegally.

Inevitably, until habitschange(assumingthattheyeverdo), traﬃc onthose roadsstill open to vehiclesis nowmore clogged than ever. Parisis“notanti-car, butanti-pollu-tion”, retortsJean-LouisMissika, the headofplanningatcityhall and a deputy to themayor. Small-particle pollution levels inthe cityare particularlyhigh. With its nar-rowmedieval streetsand its19th-centuryboulevards, the transportreformersseekabove all to discourage carsthatdo not car-rypassengers. Fully80% ofvehiclescircu-latingin central Pariscarryonlyone per-son, and 79% ofthose on itsroadsareprivatelyowned, accordingto the townhall. On September14th BlaBlaCar, aFrench ride-sharingstartup, launched Bla-BlaLines, a newapp designed to help com-mutersin the GreaterParisregion organisecarpoolingwith a couple ofclicks. With1.2m commutingtripsofover10km (sixmiles) made each dayin outerParis, thereis“massive potential” to curb the numberofemptycars, saysFrédéricMazzella, theﬁrm’sboss.

Oncurrentplans, diesel carswill be banned al-togetherfrom Parisby2020. (London, bycontrast, hasnothingnearlyasambitiousin place, though surchargesforolder dieselmodelswill come into eﬀectin the centreofthe cityfrom nextmonth. The mayor, Sa-diq Khan, isreportedlyplanningto extendthisto the whole city.) The spread ofelectric, and in timedriverless, vehiclesmeansthatParis isnotheadingtowardsa post-carfuture.

Britain had justbecome the ﬁrstcountryto vote to leavethe club, and populistswere on manoeuvresacrossthe conti-nent. Diﬃcultelectionsloomed. “OurEuropean Union is, atleastin part, in an existential crisis,” MrJunckersaid.Twelve monthson, the mood haslifted so dramatically thatlastyear’sfearshave come to seem almostquaint. There is a whiﬀofchange in the air, explained bytwo things.The ﬁrstisa sense ofoptimism. Itisfostered bydefeatsforanti-European parties inFrance, the Netherlandsand elsewhere; and bya cyclical eco-nomicupturn thathasseen the EU outpace America’sGDPgrowth fortwo years. There isalso a conﬁdence amongoﬃcialsthat, ratherthan encourage Europe’sdisruptive forces, the hor-rorsofBrexitand Donald Trump have helped Europeansrecovertheirlove forstability. One callsthe EU “super-vaccinated” byun-certaintyelsewhere. And the election ofEmmanuel Macron inFrance, alongwith the imminentre-election ofAngela Merkel inGermany, oﬀera windowofopportunityforreform.Thuswasthe scene setforMrJuncker, on September13th, todeclare the wind backin Europe’ssails. In an hour-longaddressto MEPshe scampered through an ambitioussetofproposals de-signed to illustrate thatBrusselsstill matters. Some of hismoreoutlandish notions—eg, to merge the presidenciesofthe Euro-pean Commission and Council, thuscreatingone mega-presi-dentforthe EU—reminded sceptical observerswhytheywere re-luctantto give the commission presidencyto the old federalist MrJunckerin the ﬁrstplace. Butotherideaswere broadly welcomed.Amongothergoodies, MrJunckeroﬀered a rash oftrade deals, abeefed-up cyber-securityagencyand a promise to expand the EUto the troubled countriesofthe western Balkans. MrsMerkel’schiefofstaﬀcalled itan “importantand great” speech.The second driverofMrJuncker’sambition isa quietfear thatitcould all go wrongagain. Gone in the president’saddresswerethe pleasofpreviousyearsto help the teemingmassesof irregu-larmigrantscrossingthe Mediterranean; in theirplace came a cel-ebration ofborderguardsand praise forItalyin slashing migra-tion from Libya. The trade dealsMrJunckerpromiseswithfriendlypartnerslike Australia and Japan are tempered byplansto screen foreign investmentsin “strategic” sectorsthatcutacrosscountries(thinkChinese state-owned ﬁrmsbuyinglarge Euro-pean ports). Putall thisunderthe rubric“a Europe thatprotects”,aphrase that, with MrMacron’sapproval, lookssetto serve asamantra in the yearsahead asthe EU seeksto drawthe stingfur-therfrom Euroscepticparties. Look, too, to the insistence on extendingthe signatureachievementsofthe EU to all itsmembers. MrJunckerpepperedhisspeech with treatsforeastern European countriesthat havelatelyfeltneglected, even ﬁndingtime to promise action againstfood manufacturerswho oﬄoad dodgyﬁsh ﬁngersonto Slovakconsumers. Lurkingbeneath wasa vision thatmaygive somepause. Brexitbarelyfeatured in hisspeech, butMrJuncker be-lievesthe departure ofthe countrythat, with itsendless opt-outs,threatsand prevarications, served asa constantbrake on integra-tion oﬀersa chance to setthe EU backon itsnatural path.Whatofthose countriesthatdo notshare MrJuncker’sambi-tions? The leadersofDenmarkand the Netherlandsswiftly dis-missed some ofhismore outré institutional proposals; MrJuncker, who waskite-ﬂying, will notmuch mind. More serious isthe euro area which, oﬃcialsnowlike to note, will account for85% ofthe EU economyonce Britain leaves. MrJunckerpouredcold wateron MrMacron’sproposalsfora discrete euro-zonebudgetoverseen byitsown parliament, insistingthatsuch thingsshould be managed bythe EU asa whole. Thatdebate will be re-solved in Berlin and Paris, notBrussels, butprovidesa clue to MrJuncker’sthinkingon the EU’sfuture. All itsremainingmembersbarBritain and Denmarkare obliged to join the single currency.MrJunckerpressed the pointthisweek, proposinga new “pre-ac-cession fund” to help countriesthatremain outside the euro.In passingMrJunckerisplacingtwo betswith all this. The ﬁrst isthatmean-ingful integration ispossible via stealth. The commission knowsthatchangesto the EU’streaties, with all the accompanying para-phernalia ofreferendumsand summitry, are oﬀthe table fornow.Instead oﬃcialsare unearthingso-called passerelle clausesthatallowforchangesto the EU’srule bookto be made quietly. MrJunckeralso hopesto remove national vetoesfrom some areas ofdecision-making, such astaxand bitsofforeign policy. The biggergamble isthatthere isa single vision for the EU thatisbroad enough to include everyone. The intra-Europe dividesthatMrJunckerlamented a yearago have hardlydisappeared.Rowsovermigration, moneyand the rule oflawrun so deep thatsome, notleastin Germanyand France, have increasingly beentempted bythe old idea ofa Europe runningatdiﬀerent speeds.MrJuncker, to the surprise ofsome, rejectsthat. Here, then, isthenewmood in Brussels: conﬁdentbutnotcocksure, impatient forchange afteryearsofuncomfortable stasis, butjittery thatitcouldall yetbe unwound. Itistrue thatMrJuncker, an ageing Europhileofthe old school, hasneverlooked much like an agentof change;aftermakinghisspeech in Strasbourghe cutshorthisreplies toMEPs, pleadingillness. And hisplanswill go nowhere if theydonotcapture the imagination ofEurope’snational governments.Butafteryearsofcrisis, theydo atleastshowthatthere are stillsignsoflife in Brussels. 7MrJuncker’s Indian summerThe commission presidentstrikes a conﬁdentnote afteryears ofgloomCharlemagneThe EconomistSeptember16th201749For daily analysis and debate on Britain, visitEconomist.com/britain1THE windowsofthe Biedronka Polishsupermarketin Peterborough are plas-tered with postersforlocal events: a Polish“powerdisco”, a radio festival and a familyfun day.

There isa grow-ingsense thatthe government—which an-nounced thisweekthatthe nextround oftalksin Brusselswould be delayed by sev-en days, until afterthe prime minister hasmade a bigspeech on Europe in Florence—lacksthe political skill to forge such a deli-cate compromise.On September9th TonyBlair, whoseknackforﬁddlesand fudgeshelped to sellpeace to Northern Ireland and capitalismto the LabourParty, piped up with a plan.In a reportpublished byone ofhisseveralfoundations, MrBlairproposed a deal thathe said would occupy“the space betweenBrexitAtAnyCostand simple reversal ofthe referendum”. He suggested thatthe EUmightweaken itsruleson the free move-mentofpeople—the biggestdriveroftheLeave vote—in orderto persuade Brexit-backingBritonsto switch to the Remaincamp, oratleastto acceptfree movementand thuskeep Britain eligible formember-ship ofthe single market.Some ofhisproposalsmightjustaboutbe acceptable to European leaders. Tight-eningthe ruleson migrants’ eligibilityforbeneﬁts, forinstance, hasalreadybeen sug-gested byAngela Merkel in Germany. InFrance, Emmanuel Macron iskeen toamend the so-called posted workersdirec-tive, which allowsemployerstemporarilyto provide migrantswith diﬀerentpay andconditionsto domesticones.

Butvotershave notforgiven the party forjoiningthe Conservativesin formingthe coalition government of2010-15. Aformerpresidentofthe Lib Demsonce described hispartyasthe “cockroach” ofBritish politics, foritsability to sur-vive. Yetthe coalition wasan industrial-strength cockroach killer.The Lib Demswentinto the coalition with 23% ofthe vote and 57seats. Theycame outwith 7.9% ofthe vote and eightseats. Theylostall butone oftheirMEPsand thousandsoflocal councillors.The coalition forced them to sign up to a programme ofausterityand higheruniversityfeesthatwasanathema to the party’smembers, who are disproportionatelyemployed in the publicsector. Worse, raisingfeesmeantbreakinga manifesto pledge.The party’simplosion afterthe coalition coincided with theopeningup ofitsbiggestopportunityin decades: the Brexit vote.Had the partyentered the post-referendum world with 60 seatsand a charismaticleaderitwould have had a chance ofengineer-ingthe political realignmentthatithasalwaysdreamed of. In-stead itentered thatworld asa political husk. Aparty with eightMPswasnotwell positioned to attractvoterswho wanted to re-verse the referendum.The Lib Demsare nowin a classiccycle ofdecline, with a weakbench ensuringthattheyhave weak leaderswho fail to breakthrough to voters.Tim Farron, the party’sleaderin 2015-17, wasarguablytheweakesthead ofanymajorpolitical partysince the second worldwar.Apoll taken two weeksbefore the election found that halfthe electorate could notname him. The one thinghe was knownforwasthathe wasan evangelical Christian who wasuncomfort-able abouthomosexualityand abortion. Thisreduced his appealto the secularliberalswho formed the core ofthe Remain vote.When itcame to attractingthe young, the Lib Demsmight aswellhave chosen someone who wentaround proclaimingthatbeardsand tattooswere outward displaysofmoral depravity.Vince Cable, the party’scurrentleader, isin a diﬀerent classfrom MrFarron. He isbyfarthe mostintelligentofthe three partyleaders(which isnotmeantto be damningwith faintpraise). Heisa technocratwith a wealth ofexperience in both the privatesector(he waschiefeconomistforShell in 1995-97) and in govern-ment(he wasbusinesssecretaryin the coalition) and lots ofideasforﬁxingproblemslike intergenerational inequality. He isalso apublicityhog: he appeared on “StrictlyCome Dancing”, a popu-larTV show, and hasjustpublished a novel, “Open Arms”.So MrCable will save hispartyfrom beingignored. But theotherpointson hisCV maynotworkin hisfavour. Voterswantmoral purityratherthan experience, particularlyifthat experi-ence involvesworkingfora giantoil company.

Fora varietyofreasons, from demogra-phyto American and European politics,MrGatesfearsthatcampaignsto eradicateextreme poverty, HIV and malaria are go-ingawry.

When lotsofchildren are born in countriesthatarelargelypoorand unhealthy, and fewin bet-ter-oﬀplaces, the world taken asa wholebecomespoorerand sicker. “Justto treadwatertakesincreasingeﬀort,” saysChrisMurray, the directorofthe Institute forHealth Metricsand Evaluation (IHME) atthe UniversityofWashington, which pro-duced mostofthe forecastsforthe Gatesreport.Date with destinyOverthe nextfewdecadesthe fertility gapbetween Africa and the restofthe world isexpected to narrow, butonlyexcruciating-lyslowly. IfUN projectionsare rightit willtake 40 years, from the early2010sto theearly2050s, forthe fertilityrate in sub-Sa-haran Africa to fall from the current level ofﬁve to belowthree. The same drop oc-curred over25 yearsin Latin America andthe Caribbean, and just20 yearsin Asia,beginningin the early1970s. The popula-tion ofsub-Saharan Africa, which stands atabout1bn, isexpected to reach 2bn in 2046and 3bn in 2071. Thisdemographicdivergence isa bigreason to fearthatpovertywill stickaround. Today9% ofthe world’speople arebelieved to live in extreme poverty—de-blems. So the change ofmood issigniﬁ-cant. PeterPiot, directorofthe LondonSchool ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine,describesthe reportas“a wake-up call”. Demographyisone ofthe biggestrea-sonsforgloom. Fewcountriesin a terriblemesshave a lowbirth rate (Libya and Vene-zuela are amongthe rare exceptions). Ingeneral, the poorestpartsofthe world,with the worsthealth, have the highestbirth rates. In recentdecadesan enormousfertilitygap hasopened between these be-nighted placesand everywhere else. It iscaused notbywomen in poorcountrieshavingmore children butbywomeneverywhere else havingmanyfewer. In 1950-55 Africa’smostpopulouscoun-try, Nigeria, had a fertilityrate of 6.4 (mean-ingthata woman could expectto have thatmanychildren ifshe survived through herchildbearingyears). Thatwasmuch higherthan in Europe orNorth America, butsimi-larto the biggestcountriesin Asia and Lat-in America. In the early1950sChina’sfertil-ityrate was6.0. India’swas5.9 and Brazil’swas6.1. Sixdecadeslatera chasm hadopened up. In 2010-15 Nigeria’sfertility ratewasestimated to be 5.7, whereasBrazil,China and India all had ratesbelow2.5.The Gates reportGeneration gamesThe past15 years have seen spectacularfalls in povertyand ill health.

Abouthalfofthose people are under18. Thisrepre-sentsremarkable progress: in 1990 about35% ofall people were thoughtto be ex-tremelypoorbythe same yardstick. Butprogresswill probablybe much slowerfrom nowon.In the pastquarterofa century, povertyhasfallen greatlyin Asia and Latin Ameri-ca. In 1990 two-thirdsofChinese peoplelived in extreme poverty. Atthe most re-centestimate, which relieson data from2013, just2% did. China isresponsible fortwo-thirdsofthe overall drop in deep pov-ertybetween those years. India, Indonesiaand Vietnam are also seeingitgraduallydisappear. In short, saysHomi Kharas ofthe BrookingsInstitution, a think-tank inWashington, DC, whose forecaststheGatesFoundation uses, the “bigpoolsofAsian poverty” are dryingup. Sub-Saharan Africa issadlyquite diﬀer-ent. Although the share ofAfricanslivingin deep povertyisfalling, itisnot fallingquicklyenough to outweigh rapid popula-tion growth. The numberofpaupersinsub-Saharan Africa isholdingsteadyatroughly415m. Halfofthe world’spoorpeo-ple are nowthoughtto be African (thoughstatisticsare patchyforsome verypoor,dysfunctional countries, such astheDemocraticRepublicofCongo).The region’spovertyisparticularly in-tractable. Thisislargelybecause so manyofitspauperslive well belowthe thresh-old ofextreme poverty, meaningitis hard-erto pull them overthatlevel. Itis also un-predictable. Aterrible ruler, a waror adismal harvestcould send povertyratesshootingup. The growingweightofAfri-can paupersin the global total makes fore-castingtougher. Butoverall, MrKharas ex-pectsthe share ofthe world’spopulationlivingin extreme povertyto fall to 6%around the mid-2020s, and to remain atthatlevel in 2030.AncientevilsInfectiousdiseasesadd to the reasons forconcern. Controllingthem often requiresincreasingeﬀortand risinglevelsof spend-ingjustto stand still. Butformany illnessesthataﬄictthe world’spoorestpeople, fu-ture fundingisuncertain. ThatincludesHIV, malaria and the 20 ailmentscollec-tivelyreferred to as“neglected tropical dis-eases” (NTDs), such aslymphaticﬁlariasis,riverblindnessand sleepingsickness. The example ofHIV iscautionary, saysMrGates. He fearsthatAmericansandEuropeans, lulled byplummetinginfectionratesin theirown countries, and treatmentprotocolsthatcan keep the disease at bayfordecades, thinkthe global battle againstHIV islargelywon. The term “AIDS-freegeneration” isbeingbandied about. But insome poorcountriesthere isa serious riskthatinfection rateswill startto rise. TacklingHIVrequiresco-ordinated ac-tion on several fronts. The numberof peo-ple beinginfected needsto be broughtdown, forexample bypromotingbehav-ioural changessuch asusingcondoms.Those alreadyinfected mustbe keptaliveand healthy, which requiressystemscapa-ble ofdeliveringanti-retroviral drugs andothercare. Astime goeson, risingsurvivalratesmean thatthe numberofpeople withHIV in the populationkeepsgrowing.Treatingall ofthem becomesmore diﬃcultand expensive—and poorcountrieswheremanypeople are infected, asin much of Af-rica, struggle most. Iffundingcannot keeppace, more will receive inadequate treat-ment. The viruswill multiplyin their bo-dies. Theywill become more infectiousand spread the disease further. And theywill die young.The comingyearswill see the largestyouth cohortsin Africa’shistory. By2030the continentwill be home to more than280m 15- to 24-year-olds. And more youngpeople meansmore sex, saysDrPiot. “Ifwe continue to do whatwe are doingnow—which isalreadya considerable ef-fort—thatisnotgoingto be good enough.”Malaria, too, hasbeen beaten back inthe past15 years, butcould stage a resur-gence. Avaccine isalreadyin use in severalcountries, butitseﬃcacyislimited and itisnotyetclearhowmuch use itwill be in thepoorestcountries. Drugcompaniesand re-search foundationsare workingto developbetterones, butsuccessissome wayoﬀ. Inthe meantime, drug-resistantstrainscouldevolve and spread. Withoutcontinuing re-search into newinsecticidesto use withbednets, saysMrGates, deathsfrom malar-ia could rise again, ashigh as1m a year. He also worriesthata “mood ofre-trenchment” meansthatWestern coun-triesare losinginterestin the poorest partsofthe world. Atthe same time, manyde-velopingcountriesare failingto spendenough oftheirown moneyon healthcare. Anewpaperin The Lancet, a medicaljournal, ﬁndsthat32 countriesin sub-Sa-haran Africa spend lessthan 3% ofGDP onhealth. Expertsregard 5% asthe minimumrequired to coverthe basics.International aid remainsessential.Britain’sgovernmenthasstuckto a pledgemade in 2013 to meeta UN targetofspend-ing0.7% ofGDP on aid (Britain and Ger-manyare the onlylarge donorcountries tohave reached thatlevel).

Acutof10%, itpredicts, could cost5.6m livesbetween nowand 2030. Isall the pessimism warranted? Onsome indicators, notablymaternal mortal-ity, the Gatesreportisreasonablysan-guine.

India, forexample, whichMrKharasestimatesstill has92m people inextreme poverty, could stop frittering mon-eyon fuel subsidiesand otherhand-outsthathave mostlygone to the better-oﬀ.Sub-Saharan Africa could also fare a littlebetterthan expected. Though manyoftheregion’sgovernmentsare weakand cor-rupt, atleastmostare stable these days. The mosthopeful developmentwouldbe an unexpected decline in birth rates insub-Saharan Africa. Demographershavebeen caughtoutbefore. In 1978, forexam-ple, the UN forecasta fertilityrate for Viet-nam of4.4 in 1995-2000. The rate turnedoutto be just2.2. Swiftdeclinesin the Mid-dle Eastalso came asa surprise.The persistence ofveryhigh fertility inthe region issomethingofa puzzle.

More optimis-tic, since itsuggestsbetterpolicies couldturn thingsaround, isthe theorythat pooraccessto modern contraceptivesisthemain problem. LookatBangladesh and Iran, says JohnBongaartsofthe Population Council, inNewYork. Bangladesh promoted familyplanningbymobilisingvillage women topreach the virtuesofcontraception. In the1980sIran lurched from pro-natalistpoli-ciesto promotingfamilyplanning. In bothcountries, the birth rate plunged. Few Afri-can countrieshave done the same (the bigexceptionsare two highlyauthoritarianstates, Ethiopia and Rwanda, and one well-run democracy, Botswana). “It’sreallyveryfrustrating,” saysMrBongaarts. Sub-Saharan Africa maymuddle itswayto a lowerbirth rate fasterthan theforecastersestimate, even withouthelpfrom governments. The region’scitiesaregrowingata terriﬁcclip ofabout4% a year.Thisgrowth isoften unplanned and messy,and the citiesare seldom terriblyproduc-tive. Buturban livingislikelyto suppressbirth rates, all the same. Whereasfarmerscan puteven youngchildren to workpull-ingweedsand mindinggoats, city-dwell-erstend to ﬁnd thattheiroﬀspring add littleto household outputand, moreover, re-quire expensive schooling. Asa result, theyseekto have fewerchildren. Anotherhope fora betterfuture is thatmedical progresswill be fasterthan expect-ed.

JeremyFarrar ofthe Wellcome Trust, a medical-researchcharity, warnsthatuntreatable strains ofHIV mayemerge. Mostpathogenseventu-allydevelop resistance to the drugsused totreatthem. Ifdrug-resistantstrains becomecommon, saysDrFarrar, “imagine control-linga second peakofHIV.” The real value ofthe predictions in theGatesreportislessthattheygive an accu-rate picture ofthe world in 2030, than thattheyprovide estimatesofwhatisatstake.Between itsoptimisticand pessimistic sce-nariosare the livesand wellbeingof mil-lionsofpeople.

Between nowand 2030, the diﬀerence between the best-and the worst-case scenariosin the deathsofunder-ﬁvesrepresentsabout7.8m lives,accordingto the IHME. Formaternaldeathsthe diﬀerence is377,000. The reportalso highlightsthe biggestrisksto progress—namely, the control ofin-fectiousdiseases. IfHIV ormalaria comesroaringback, the impactwill be felt veryquickly. Worryingly, the greaterthe pro-gressagainsta disease, the harderit istomotivate people and governmentsto keepgoing. An anti-malaria campaign in the1950sand 1960sisinstructive.

Take “variable interestentities” (VIEs), a kind ofcor-porate architecture used mainlybyChina’stech ﬁrms, includingtwo superstars, Alibaba and Tencent. Theygo largelyunre-marked, butVIEshave become incrediblyimportant. Investorsoutside China have about$1trn invested in ﬁrmsthatuse them.Fewlegal expertsthinkthatVIEsare aboutto collapse, but fewexpectthem to endure, either. One sizeable investoradmits lov-ingChinese tech ﬁrms’ businesseswhile feelingqueasyabouttheirlegal structures. Like scientistsappalled bytheir monstrouscreations, even the lawyerswho designed VIEsworry. Theyare“China’sversion oftoo-big-to-fail”, saysone. Aswell asbeingspooky, VIEsare anotherinstance ofhowChina’sweakpropertyrightshurtitscitizens.Whatare VIEs? Over100 companiesuse them. Since the 1990sprivate ﬁrmshave soughtto breakfree ofChina’sisolated legaland ﬁnancial systems. Manyhave done so byformingholdingcompaniesin taxhavensand listingtheirsharesin New YorkorHongKong. The problem isthattheyare then usuallycategorisedas“foreign ﬁrms” underChinese rules. Thatin turn prohibitsthem from owningassetsin some politicallysensitive sectors,mostnotablythe internet.The lawyers’ quickﬁx, ﬁrstused in 2000, wasto shiftthesesensitive assets, such asoperatinglicences, into special legal enti-ties—VIEs—thatare owned byChinese individuals, usually theﬁrms’ bosses. The companiessign contractswith the VIEsandtheirindividual owners, which the companiessayguaranteesthem control overthe VIEs’ assets, salesand proﬁts. Abracadabra! Alibaba, the world’ssixth-mostvaluable ﬁrm, illustrates howitworks. Itisincorporated in the Cayman Islandsand in 2014 list-ed itssharesin NewYork, butmakes91% ofitssalesin mainlandChina.

Itisunclear ifVIEsareeven legal in China. The latestannual reportsofthe ten largestﬁrmsthatuse them all admitto uncertaintyabouttheir status. In2015 a draftreform from the MinistryofCommerce appeared toban some VIEs, butthe initiative hasgone nowhere.Meanwhile, VIEshave become more prominent; the total val-ue ofcompaniesthatuse them hassoared asChina’sinternetin-dustryhasboomed.

Innine cases, theirstructure haschanged in thatperiod: eitherthenamesornumberofentities, orthe namesorstakesoftheir Chi-nese owners, have been altered. Iftheyare beinghonest, mostshareholdershave little idea whatisgoingon.Forinvestors, there are two risks. First, the VIEscould be ruledillegal, potentiallyforcingthe ﬁrmsto wind up orsell vital li-cencesand intellectual propertyin China. The second danger isthatVIEownersseekto grab the proﬁtsorassetsheld within. Iftheyrefuse to co-operate, die, orfall outofpolitical favour, itis farfrom clearthatﬁrmscan enforce VIEcontractsin Chinese courts.Yetthismanifestlyﬂawed system hasendured fortwo de-cades. One theoryisthatmanagersfavouritbecause it givesthemmore power—itishard foroutside shareholdersto keep track ofVIEs. Like theirpeersin Silicon Valley, who limitvoting rights,China’stech tycoonsdislike itwhen investorscall the shots. The biggerquestion iswhyChina’sgovernmenttoleratestheset-up.

In the eventofa trade war, aquickwayto hurtAmericans’ economicinterests(alongwithbanningApple, which makesa ﬁfth ofitssalesin China) wouldbe to void VIEs, although China’sreputation with all investorswould suﬀer.Unscrambling eggsButfailingto tackle the statusquohaswidercosts, chiefofwhichisthathavinginternetﬁrmslisted abroad meansmostChinesecitizenscannotinvestin the mostdynamicbitoftheir economy.

AsChina’sinternetﬁrmsgetbigger, theunfairnessofthiswill become evermore glaring.VIEsneed to be unwound. Some small internetﬁrmshaveboughtbackall theirsharesand delisted in America, then relistedin mainland China, butthe costofthisforthe bigﬁrms would beprohibitive. Alternatively, theycould create dual listings inShanghai orﬂoatthe sharesoftheirsubsidiariesthere forlocals toinvestin.

At thestartofSeptember2008, the month whenLehman Brotherscollapsed, the Fed’sas-setstotalled $905bn (atthe time, about6%ofGDP). ByDecembertheyhad more thandoubled in size, to $2.1trn.

The bench-marksare the averagesforall banksincountrieswhere the seven are active,weighted bythe importance ofeach mar-ketin each bank’sloan book.Mostofthe banksfall shorton mostmeasures. Forexample, UBSexpectsStan-dard Chartered’sreturn on tangible equityto be just5.7% in 2018, 7.1pointsbelowitsbenchmark.

Itseemedludicrousto scrap the portraitofthe oneperson on a note who helped create Amer-ica’sﬁnancial system. Itdid nothelp thathe wasalso the hero ofa smash-hitBroad-waymusical. So the administration decid-ed instead to replace AndrewJackson,America’sseventh president, on the $20bill. Butbythen itwastoo close to the elec-tion to push the change through. PresidentDonald Trump hassince lenthissupportto keepingJackson. In a recentinterview, histreasurysecretary, StevenMnuchin, made itclearhe had little inter-estin pursuingthe change. Thatisa greatpity. Tubman wasa remarkable womanwho emerged from chainsto lead otherslavesto freedom. (Like the currentadmin-istration, she wasalso a Republican, ifin averydiﬀerentparty.)Itisalso odd thatJackson, ofall people,everappeared on a note backed bythe cen-tral bank, letalone survived so long. Hewasa popularpresident, a successful gen-eral and founderofthe modern Democrat-icParty. Butaswell asthe grim aspects ofhiscareer—hisownership ofslavesandsupportforthe forced relocation ofnativeAmericans—hisapproach to the publicﬁ-nances, though intellectuallydefensible,makeshisuse on a note singularlyironic.On takingoﬃce, he declared war onwhatwasthen the nation’scentral bank.He thoughtitbeyond propercongressionaloversightand too inﬂuential (criticism of-ten made ofitssuccessortoday). He toldMartin Van Buren, laterthe eighth presi-dent: “The bank…istryingto kill me, but Iwill kill it.” And, unlike currentcritics ofFed policy, he actuallydid so, despite ob-jectionsbyCongress, the courtsand two ofhisown treasurysecretaries, whom heﬁred forimpedinghisattack. Whatfol-lowed wasa period when currencywasis-sued bya private bank. Thatended whenAbraham Lincoln needed to ﬁnance theprosecution ofthe civil war.Thereafter, banknotesinitiallyfeaturedadiverse range ofpersonalities: presidentsofcourse, includingLincoln; butalso gen-erals, secretariesoftreasuryand state,women in allegorical roles(both robedand partiallydisrobed), children, boats,trains, eagles, bisonsand even MarthaWashington, America’sﬁrstFirstLady.The risksofthisapproach became obvi-ousafterthe ﬁrstsuperintendentof thecurrencybureau, SpencerClark, puthisown image on a note.

Ifone explanation forAmerican bank-note conservatism isthe political diﬃcultyofmakinganychangesatall, atleast thereisno urgencyto act. The new$20, forexam-ple, isnotdue to be circulated until 2030.Bythen banknotesmayhave been super-seded entirelyand the $20 Tubman bill beno more than a historical curiosity. 7American banknotesNo changeNEW YORKPutting a newface on a banknote isoddlydiﬃcult68FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistSeptember16th2017IN2004 StanleyFischerdescribed the wonderhe feltas an eco-nomicsstudentin the 1960s. “Youhad a setofequations”, hesaid, “thatmeantyoucould control the economy.” Technocracy—the dream ofscientiﬁcgovernmentbya caste ofwise men—arosein the 20th century, asrapid change rendered the world unfath-omablycomplex; in economics, itcame ofage in the Keynesianrevolution ofthe 1930s. On September6th, aftera remarkablydis-tinguished careerin publicservice, MrFischer, an intellectualheirto Keynes, announced hisimminentretirementasthe vice-chairman ofthe Federal Reserve. Itistemptingto see in hisdepar-ture the end ofthe era and the ideal oftechnocracy. Acenturyago, asphysicistsunlocked the secretsofthe atomand biochemistsprobed the molecularbasisoflife, economistssoughtto systematise theirown ﬁeld. Butthe growingcomplex-ityoftheirworkcreated a problem: laymen could notmake headortail ofit. Governmentconsultation with experts, orthe delega-tion ofauthorityto them, became critical to the management ofthe economy. War-time state planningempowered technocratsfurther. And in the yearsafterthe second world war, when MrFi-scherwasa boyin whatwasthen Northern Rhodesia (now Zam-bia), technocraticprincipleswere enshrined in extragovernmen-tal institutionslike the World Bankand the IMF, and in panels ofeconomicadviserswhose systemsofKeynesian equationspro-duced forecastsand shaped policy. These systemswere ﬂawed. Trouble struckin the 1970s. Slow-inggrowth, wobblingcurrenciesand risinginﬂation upset thestatusquo and bolstered scepticsofKeynesian ideas, like RobertLucas. Adose ofstimulusmightfool people into thinking theeconomywasdoingbetterthan itwas, and so into working hard-er—butonlyfora while. People would catch on, and inﬂationratherthan growth would result. MrFischerquestioned thisfatalism and, in so doing, helpedmake the intellectual case forrevitalisingtechnocratic manage-ment. Thatworkwascentred on the MassachusettsInstitute ofTechnology(MIT), the home ofeconomicluminarieslike PaulSamuelson and RudigerDornbusch and the theoriesthatwouldbecome NewKeynesianism. There, MrFischerand othersex-plored when a deftintervention could do some good. In 1977, forinstance, he argued thatlong-term contractsprevented prices andwagesfrom adjustingquicklyto changesin economicfortunes.Such frictionscould lead to soaringunemploymentunlesstrained economistswere on hand to tend the government’spoli-cylevers. NewKeynesianism became the orthodoxyin centralbanksand ﬁnance ministriesaround the world.Aparade ofeconomictalentcame to workwith and learnfrom MrFischer. Theyincluded Ben Bernanke, who would laterlead the Federal Reserve through the ﬁnancial crisis; MarioDraghi, who nowpilotsthe European Central Bank(ECB); OlivierBlanchard, until recentlychiefeconomistatthe IMF, aswell as hissuccessor, Maurice Obstfeld. These men helped build modernmacroeconomics, then wentoutinto the world to applyit.In that, theyfollowed the example ofMrFischer. In the late1980she joined the World Bankaschiefeconomist. He coulddrawon hisresearch on economicgrowth—and the policyerrorsthatcould waylayit. Laterhe became the deputymanaging direc-torofthe IMF, puttinghim atthe centre ofbattlesto contain theﬁnancial crisesthatpunctuated the 1990s. Aftera turn atCiti-group, he wentto run the BankofIsrael, navigatingthe Israelieconomythrough the GreatRecession. Then, in 2014, BarackObama nominated him forthe vice-chairmanship ofthe Fed.MrFischerand hisacolytesoften operated underintense pres-sure. In the 1990sthe IMFfaced witheringcriticism forthe termsitimposed on strugglingborrowers. Butitfaced hard choices; moregeneroustermsfrom the fund mighthave helped the citizens ofbeleaguered economies, butalso given spendthriftgovernmentslicence to misbehave—orputsupportforthe IMFitselfatrisk.MessrsBernanke and Draghi have theirdetractors, butwere in-strumental in savingtheirrespective economiesfrom catastro-phe. Recentelectoral pratfallsargue forleavingcritical decisionsin the handsofwell-trained, pragmatictechnocrats.Even so, technocracyisin retreat.

Manydrugshavebeen invented to combatthatproblem, butnone isaseﬀective asdoctorswould like.Now, astheydescribe in a paperin ACSMacro Letters, a team led byMitsuhiro Eb-ara atthe National Institute forMaterialsScience in Japan have come up with a newapproach.

Chaoticdeathsare the end resultofa processcalled necrosis, in which tox-ins, pathogensorotherformsofdamagecause a cell to fail catastrophically and rup-ture, spillingitscontentsin the process. Thedetection ofthisdetritusbythe immunesystem leadsto an inﬂammation response. Graceful death, known asapoptosis, isasortofpre-planned cellularsuicide. Ithappensnaturallythroughoutlife and isvital formanydevelopmental events(likethe separation ofﬁngersbefore birth). Un-like necrosis, the leftoversofapoptosis aremostlytolerated bythe immune system.DrEbara knewfrom previousresearch thatthisisbecause cellscovertheirmembranesin an immune-suppressingcompoundcalled phosphatidyl-serine justbefore theybreakup. Collectingcellularfragmentscoated in phosphatidylserine and intro-ducingthem to areasofinﬂammation candramaticallyimprove healingbypersuad-ingthe immune system to stand down.Butharvestingthose remnantsistricky,since theydegrade quickly. Instead, Dr Eb-ara wondered whetherhe could build po-lymersdecorated with artiﬁcialphosphatidylserine. These impostorscould then be used to dupe overactive im-mune cellsinto believingthatapoptosisratherthan necrosiswastakingplace. The researchersworked with mouseimmune cellsthathad been treated eitherwith lipopolysaccharide, a bacterial com-pound thatreliablytriggersan aggressiveimmune response, orwith inoﬀensive sa-line solution and leftascontrols. Once thebacterial lure had created the expected in-ﬂammatoryresponse, DrEbara and hiscolleaguestreated the immune cellswitheithersaline solution (again, asa control)orwith the speciallycoated polymers. Throughoutthe experimentthe teamcollected immune cellsfrom theirPetridishesand monitored them undera micro-scope. Theyknewfrom earlierworkthatmacrophages, a particulartype ofimmunecell, change shape dependingon whattheyare doing. Those thatdrive inﬂamma-tion spoutlongpseudopodsfrom their bo-dies. Those thatdo notlookroundish. The team reportthatmore than 80% ofthe macrophagestreated with lipopolysac-charide and then saline grewlongpseudo-pods. Lessthan 10% ofthe macrophagestreated solelywith saline had pseudo-pods. Butwhen the cellswere dosed withboth the agitatinglipopolysaccharide andthen with DrEbara’spolymer, lessthan20% ended up in pro-inﬂammation mode. Itisa longwayfrom the lab to the medi-cine cupboard. Buta betterwayto dampdown chronicinﬂammation would bewelcome. Some ofitsconsequences, likehayfever, are merelyannoying. Butit canalso constrictthe arteries, cause arthritisand even raise the oddsofcontractingformsofcancer.

On September15th, atacomputingconference held in Miami,Shyam Gollakota and hiscolleaguesat theUniversityofWashington are due to un-veil a gadgetthatcan do exactlythat—andwith onlya fraction ofthe powerrequiredbythe bestdevicescurrentlyavailable. DrGollakota’sinvention usesa tech-nologycalled “LoRa” (from “longrange”). Wireless data transmissionCheap andcheerfulAcleverwayto send data on the cheapcould help make smartcities a reality72ScienceandtechnologyThe EconomistSeptember16th20172Like Wi-Fi, thisallowscomputersto talk toeach otherwith radio waves. Unlike Wi-Fi,though, LoRa isnoteasilyblocked by walls,furniture and otherobstacles. Thatis partlybecause LoRa useslower-frequencyradiowavesthan Wi-Fi (900MHzratherthan2.4GHz). Such wavespassthrough objectsmore easily. More importantly, LoRa de-vicesmake use ofa technique called “chirpspread modulation”. Thatmeansthe fre-quencyofthe carrierwave—the basicradiowave, which isthen deliberatelydeformedin orderto carrydata—risesand falls in asawtooth pattern. Thatmakeseven faintLoRa signalseasyto distinguish from back-ground noise, which ﬂuctuatesrandomly.Generatingthatcarrierwave requires alotofpower. Butmodulatingit, in order toimpressdata upon it, can be done bya chipthatconsumesalmostno poweratall. Con-ventional LoRa transmittersdo both jobs.DrGollakota proposesto separate them. In histake on the system, a central trans-mitter, hooked up to a bigbatteryor to themains, broadcaststhe carrierwave, whilethe taskofimpregnatingitwith data isdone bya chip on the sensor. Itaccom-plishesthatbychoosingto earth its tinyae-rial, ornot, millionsoftimesevery second.When the aerial isearthed, partofthe car-rierwave will be absorbed. When itis not,itwill be reﬂected. Ifone ofthose casesisdeemed to stand for“1” while the otherrepresents“0”, the chip can relaydata backto a receiverwith the whole processcon-trolled bythree tiny, and thusveryfrugal,electronicswitches. DrGollakota reckonsthatsuch chipscan be made forlessthan 20 centsapiece.The signalstheygenerate can be detectedatrangesofhundredsofmetres. Yetwith apowerconsumption ofjust20 millionthsofa watt, a standard watch batteryshouldkeep them goinga decade ormore. In fact,itmightbe possible to powerthem fromambientenergy: DrGollakota and hiscol-leagueshave experimented with runningthe chipsfrom the electricitygeneratedwhen lightstrikesa small photodiode. LikeotherLoRa devices, the chipsare slow,transmittingdata ataboutthe speed of anold-fashioned dial-up modem. Butmostsmartsensorswill produce justa trickle ofdata in anycase. The researchersare keepingquiet, forthe time being, aboutthe ordersthey havereceived. Butearlyapplicationscould bemedical. The team have incorporated thechipsinto contactlensesand a skin patch.In hospitals, the chipscould help trackeverythingfrom patientgurneysto sy-ringesand stethoscopes. Lastyear, Dr Gol-lakota unveiled variantsofthe chips thatuse ordinaryWi-Fi, too.

He quipped to his eco-nomicadviserthat“Youare nothere to telluswhatto do, butto explain to uswhy wehave done it.” Itwasa remarkthathinted atthe com-mitmentto aristocraticamateurism thatmanyfeel the bankhasdisplayed forthreecenturies. Today’sbankismuch more pro-fessional, butitisnonethelessblamed bythe leftforfailingto preventthe ﬁnancialcrisisand bythe rightforitsbleak forecastsofthe economiccostsofBrexit. So there islikelyto be a readyaudienceforthisbookfrom David Kynaston, a dis-tinguished and tirelesshistorian who hasalreadywritten fourvolumeson the CityofLondon, amongotherworks. Asalways,MrKynaston’sgeneroususe ofhissourcematerial makesthisa heavyweighttome.Admittedly, there isa lotto cover. Thebankwasfounded in the 17th century. In re-turn fora loan thathelped William III ﬁ-nance a waragainstFrance, the bankwasgiven the rightto issue papermoney. Itwassuch a good businessthatGeorge Wash-ington remained a shareholderin the bankthroughoutthe American warofindepen-dence. Overtime, the bank’srole expand-ed to manage the government’sﬁnances,safeguard the value ofthe currencyand su-pervise the ﬁnancial system.Sometimes, in a crisis, itwashard to rec-oncile these objectives. Bythe 20th cen-tury, the bank, which wasa private com-panyuntil 1946, found itsaimsstarting toconﬂictwith those ofdemocratically elect-ed governments. In 1931, duringNorman’slonggovernorship, the bank’sinsistenceon publicspendingcutsto maintain thegold standard caused the collapse ofa La-bourgovernment. AnewConservative-dominated administration abandoned thestandard anyway, addingto Labourresent-ment; when the partycame backto powerafterthe war, itnationalised the bank.The post-1945 bankstruggled to adapt.Itsleadingﬁgureswere overwhelminglydrawn from the private schools; itswork-ingconditionswere Dickensian until the1960s. Bythe 1970s, itsreputation wasbad-lydented: itplayed a subordinate role ineconomicpolicyto the Treasury, while itsregulatorycompetence wascalled intoquestion bya bankingcrisis. MargaretThatcherreferred to Gordon Richardson,governorfrom 1973 to 1983, as“thatfoolwho runsthe BankofEngland”.Butitturned outthatpoliticians wereprettyhopelessatrunningthe economy;afterBritain’signominiousexitfrom theEuropean exchange-rate system in 1992, theintellectual fashion favoured greater inde-pendence forcentral banks. GordonBrown, then chancellorofthe exchequer,gave the bankthe rightto setinterest ratesin 1997. The currentgovernor, MarkCarney,isa more inﬂuential economicactorthanthe chancellorofthe exchequer; when hewashired atgreatexpense from the BankofCanada in 2013, itwasasifa British foot-ball team had hired Lionel Messi. MrKynaston isscrupulouslyfair, somuch so thatthe bookmighthave beneﬁt-ed from a more pointed analysisofwheth-erthe bankhasperformed itsmanyroleswell. Atleastthe modern bankismoretransparentthan ever, publishingdetailedassessmentsofthe economyand the mar-ketsthatoften reveal mistaken forecasts.Thatcandourwould have alarmed Nor-man who, when asked byan MP forthesource ofhisinformation, replied by sage-lytappinghisnose three times. 7The Bank of EnglandAbank ofmanytradesTill Time’s Last Sand: A History of the Bankof England 1694-2013.By David Kynaston.Bloomsbury Publishing; 896 pages; £35. Tobe published in America in November; $75The EconomistSeptember16th2017 Booksandarts75THE latestnovel from Nicole Krauss,“ForestDark”, openswith the mysteri-ousdisappearance ofJulesEpstein. This vi-tal man ofgreatappetitesand ﬁerce argu-mentshad spentnearlyseven decadesdevoted to the pleasuresofthisworld,swaddled in cashmere and surrounded byOld Mastersin hisposh Fifth Avenue ﬂat.Yetin the yearbefore he vanished, after thedeathsofhisparents, Epstein evinced asudden “longingforlightness”. He di-vorced hiswife of36 years, shed hiswealth(to the alarm ofhischildren) and ﬂed to Is-rael, where he mayhave whiled awayhisﬁnal monthsin a grottyJaﬀa ﬂat.Israel’sinviting“opennessand immedi-acy” also lure Nicole, a novelistwith writ-er’sblock, temporarilyfrom herBrooklynhome, crumblingmarriage and two youngsons. Like Epstein, Nicole isseeking an-swersto questionsshe hasnotquiteformed yet. And like Epstein’s, hertrip be-comesa confoundingadventure. These tales, which MsKraussunspoolsin alternatingchapters, are both largely setin Israel, a vibrant, complicated placewhere “so little washidden orheld back—howevermessyand intense.” Oddly, theseduellingnarratives—Epstein in the thirdperson, Nicole in the ﬁrst—neverquite in-tersect. Theirstoriesalso enjoydiﬀerentpacing. Epstein’sbitstend to be more lively,amusingand acutelyobserved, whereasNicole’smostlyinhabitthe realm ofherown thoughts. Yetthe resonancesbetween these char-actersare often profound. Both are search-ingfortheirtrue selves, an ocean awayfrom the old livesthathave tested theirfaith. In theireagernessfornewways for-ward, both are vulnerable to the sway ofcharismaticmen with bigplansforthem (arabbi forEpstein; a literaryprofessor withpossible tiesto Mossad and an unbeliev-able tale aboutKafka forNicole). Also,mostpoignantly, both narrativesoﬀer inci-sive observationsabouthowmarriagescan growinsidious, and howinstincts canbe deluding.Epstein, forexample, sometimesmisseshiswife’sbodyin bed (“Withouttherhythm ofherbreath the darkhad no mea-sure”), even ashe recognisesthat“ifhe wastouched bylonging, itwasnotforwhathe’d had and given up.” Nicole, mean-while, notesthatthe devotion she and herhusband share fortheirchildren longmasked the waytheywere driftingapart,until itseemed thatthisparental love “onlyshone a lighton howalone each ofus was,and, compared to ourchildren, howun-loved”. Thisiswhere hernovel shines. In-deed, MsKrauss’srecentdivorce makesitrathereasyto presume a level ofautobiog-raphyin the ruminationsofhernovelist al-terego with the same name. The plotof“ForestDark” often oscillatesbetweenloftyconceptsand shaggyimplausibility,butthe feelingsEpstein and Nicole haveabouttheirlivesand lovesfeel hard-earned and true.7New American ﬁctionChanged courses Forest Dark.By Nicole Krauss. Harper; 304pages; $27.99. Bloomsbury; £16.99ASTHE one-time loverand lifelong busi-nesspartnerofYvesSaintLaurent,Pierre Bergé wasDiaghilevto SaintLau-rent’sbrilliantStravinsky. Demanding,small ofstature and in possession of aﬁlthytemper, he was, to some, quite terri-fying. Yethe wasalso a bold and successfulbusinessman, a noted artcollector, a gener-ouspatron and philanthropistand a capa-ble administrator. He had a profound be-liefin the importance ofthe creativeimpulse. MrBergé, who died on September8th,wasa social liberal and a political conser-vative, a moverin the circlesofstate-fund-ed culture. He voted forValéryGiscardd’Estaing, the centre-rightpresident, in theelection of1981, butwenton to ﬂourish un-derthe winnerand MrGiscard’ssuccessor,FrançoisMitterrand, a socialist. The presi-dentmade him head ofthe Opéra Nationalde Parisin 1988; he oversawthe building ofanewopera house atthe Place de la Bas-tille in Paris, in honourofthe 200th anni-versaryofthe French revolution.He metSaintLaurentin Parisin 1958,three yearsafterthe designerhad been tak-en on byChristian Dior. The two mencould nothave been more diﬀerent: MrBergé wasstockywhere SaintLaurentwasasthin asa reed. MrBergé wasenergetic,opinionated, and liked good food, wineand conversation. He had grown up in afamilythatdid notcare thathe wasgay. ForSaintLaurent, who grewup in French Alge-ria, beinggaywasdeeplyembarrassing tohisconservative father. Sixyearsyoungerthan MrBergé, SaintLaurentwasexcep-tionallyshyand, although a brilliant de-signer, needed constantcare and reassur-ance. In fashion lore, itwasa coup defoudre: love atﬁrstsight. Though their ro-manticrelationship came to an end in 1976,when SaintLaurentretreated into drugs,alcohol and reclusiveness, the profession-al partnership between the two men con-tinued foryearsafterwards.The fashion house needed both men tosurvive. The ﬁnancial backerswho tookcharge ofChristian Diorafterthe ac-claimed couturierdied in 1957 proved ob-durate, asdid the house’solder, conserva-tive clients. The youngSaintLaurent feltshackled. So in 1961MrBergé sold hisﬂaton the Île Saint-Louisand the two men setup in businessasYvesSaintLaurent(YSL).Thirtyyearslater, in the depthsofreces-sion, he asked Wasserstein Perella, a bou-tique investmentbank, to ﬁnd a buyer forYSL, askingfor$1bn in cash.In the meantime, the two had becomeimportantcollectors. Decoratinga magniﬁ-centduplexin Rue de Babylone (one of themostbeautiful private apartmentsin Par-is), a chateauin homage to Proustin Nor-mandy, and Villa Oasis, theirmansion re-treatin Marrakech, gave MrBergé andSaintLaurentthe excuse to begin collectingartand antiques. In February2009, eightmonthsafterSaintLaurent’sdeath, MrBergé sold the lot: the three Mondrianpaintingsboughtto celebrate the launch ofSaintLaurent’siconicshiftdress, the EileenGraychair(a modernisticon) and the mag-niﬁcentsilver-giltornamentsmade innorthern Germanyin the 17th century. Thesale raised €374m ($448m): MrBergé divid-ed the proceedsbetween variousAIDScharitiesand a plan to build a museum inhomage to SaintLaurent.Thatproject, which will be unveilednextmonth, turned outto be two muse-ums. The ﬁrstwill be in Paris, where thetwo opened their fashion house, and thesecond will be in Marrakech, theirspiritualhome. Between them the two museumswill house 7,000 textiles, 8,000 sketches,8,000 accessoriesand 15,000 documents:in all 38,000 objectsthatthe two men col-lected obsessively. Theyalwaysknewtheywould one daybuild a museum to the de-signer, the ﬁrstofitskind in the world.7Pierre BergéMan atthe wheelThe demanding co-founderofYvesSaintLaurentwas crucial to its success76BooksandartsThe EconomistSeptember16th2017THE greatnovelsofthe Vietnam war,both in English and in Vietnamese,tend towardssurrealism. In Tim O’Brien’s“The ThingsTheyCarried”, an armymedicmanagesto have his17-year-old sweetheartﬂown in from Ohio fora visit, onlytowatch hertransform into a bloodthirstycommando sportinga necklace ofhumantongues. In Bao Ninh’s“The SorrowofWar”, ghostshauntthe Jungle ofScream-ingSouls, and severed limbsrain from theskyduringa B-52 raid. The two writers,who foughton opposite sides, are amongthe dozensofintervieweesfeatured in“The Vietnam War”, a ten-part, 18-hourhis-torybyKen Burnsand Lynne Novick. LikeMrBurns’searlierwork, the newseriesisencyclopaedicand solemn, butthistimethere isalso an elementofpsychedelicfrenzy. Thisispartlybecause, aswith thenovels, the material demandsit. Butit ispartlybecause the war, a decade-longnightmare thatkilled 58,000 Americansand over2m Vietnamese, remainstoo con-tested fora purelyelegiactreatment. Itspoliticsstill splitboth American and Viet-namese societytoday.One wayAmerica hastried to processthe warisbycastingitasan unnecessarytragedy. Like manyotherhistorians, MrBurnsand MsNovicktrace the pointsatwhich thingsmighthave taken a diﬀerentturn, such asthe briefalliance between HoChi Minh’sVietMinh guerrillasand theOSS (precursorto the CIA) atthe end of thesecond world war, and America’sunwisedecision to backFrance asittried to holdon to itscolony. Later, asPresidents Kenne-dyand Johnson are forced to deploytroopsin South Vietnam to protecttheirclientstate from a communisttakeover, the ﬁlm-makersreveal both men’ssecretdoubts. Inataped memo, Kennedyblameshimselfforapprovingthe militarycoup thatkilledSouth Vietnam’sautocraticpresident, NgoDinh Diem. Johnson tellsa senator, “Thereain’tno daylightin Vietnam,” even ashesendsin the ﬁrstMarines. Such presiden-tial qualmscreate a sense ofthe road nottaken; had Kennedylived orJohnson beenmore conﬁdent, theyimply, America mighthave heeded itsbetterimpulses.Yetthe uncomfortable truth isthatwhereasthe warwasin one sense an aber-ration from America’scharacter, itwas alsoan expression ofit. Kennedy’sintellectualarrogance and Johnson’scowboybravadowere two versionsofthe same typicalAmerican overconﬁdence. Throughouttheseries, the Americans’ misguided relianceon quantitative technical approachestocomplexproblemscomesup overandoveragain, from the “bodycount” measureused bythe haplessGeneral William West-moreland to the computer-processed paci-ﬁcation statisticsofRobertMcNamara, thedefence secretary. The American beliefthatmassive bombingwould dissuade theNorth Vietnamese from tryingto unifytheircountrybetrayed a cripplinginabilityto understand thatothers’ worldviewsmightbe diﬀerentfrom theirs. Oras JamesWillbanks, an armystrategist, describesthisapproach: “When McNamara wantstoknowwhatHo Chi Minh isthinking, he in-terviewshimself.”The serieswill be equallywrenchingforVietnamese viewers. The conﬂictwas acivil war, numerousVietnamese inter-vieweesinsist—“down to the familylevel”,saysDuongVan Mai Elliott, a Vietnamese-American academicfrom the South whosesisterwentnorth to join the communists.Thismightseem blindinglyobvious, ex-ceptthatthe governmentin Hanoi has al-waysresolutelydenied it. ForVietnam’scommunistrulers, the formerSouth Viet-namese governmentwasa “puppetre-gime” controlled byAmerica, and the warwasnotbetween two groupsofVietnam-ese butbetween the Vietnamese peopleand foreign invaders. To admitotherwisewould be to acknowledge thatthere couldbe more than one source ofpolitical legiti-macyin Vietnam.Americans, too, longridiculed SouthVietnam and the Armyofthe RepublicofVietnam (ARVN) ascorruptand sham-bolic. ButMrBurnsand MsNovick, likemanyhistorianstoday, recognise thatsome ARVN unitswere disciplined and pa-triotic, and thatthe country, forall itsﬂaws,wasrelativelyfree and had a strongcivilsociety. Today’sVietnamese government,byfailingto pursue a full rehabilitation ofthe formeroﬃcialsand soldiersofSouthVietnam and to allowa free debate aboutrightsand wrongson both sides, continuesto hamperthe country’sreconciliation.Partofthe force of“The Vietnam War”comesfrom itsstartlingprimarymaterial.The ﬁlm-makersinterviewed GeorgeWickes, then in hislate 80s, who waswiththe OSS mission thatmetHo in 1945. Theypersuade two ageingNorth VietnameseArmyveteransto acknowledge theNorth’smassacre ofthousandsofciviliansin Hue afterthe Tetoﬀensive in 1968, whichthe communistgovernmenthasalwaysdenied. Theyplayrecordingsfrom theOval Oﬃce in which Richard Nixon andHenryKissingeropenlyadmitthattheirprogramme to “Vietnamise” the war(ie, re-move American troopsand hand all re-sponsibilityto the ARVN) isdoomed, andisintended merelyto distance Americafrom the South’sinevitable collapse. Butthe powerofthe seriesalso derivesfrom itsdisturbingcontemporaryechoes.To listen to Nixon’sWhite House tapesis tofeel nostalgia fora time when political ly-ingwascoherentand directed towards ra-tional policyobjectives. One cannotwatchfootage ofconstruction workersbeatinganti-wardemonstratorsin NewYorkCityin 1970 withoutthinkingofCharlottesville;footage ofthe killingoffourstudents bythe National Guard atKentState inevitablyrecallstoday’sroilingcampusesand po-lice-brutalityscandals. (Atthe time, a pollshowed mostAmericansthoughtthe deadstudentshad itcoming.) MrBurnsnotesthathe and MsNovickﬁnished the ﬁlmsovera yearbefore Do-nald Trump’selection; the resonances, hesays, stem from history’shabitnotofre-peating, butrhyming. The seriesends withthe construction ofMaya Lin’sVietnamwarmemorial in 1982, the gradual easingoftensionsbetween supportersand oppo-nentsofthe war, and the normalisation ofrelationsbetween America and Vietnamin the 1990s. ButtodayAmerica’smercuri-al foreign policyisweakeningthatnewfriendship with Vietnam, and the hatredbetween the country’srightand lefthas ris-en to levelsnotseen for40 years. Adecadeago, itfeltasthough the Vietnam war hadbeen putto rest. Today, the rhymesof his-toryare uncomfortablyloud.7America and VietnamBuried ordnanceAnewseries digs up the Vietnam warjustas American politics have again becomeexplosiveTheir children will remember, too77The Economist September16th2017                                                                 Call for nominations for the IDB Prizein Islamic Banking and Finance for 1439H (2018G)The Islamic Development Bank Group is pleased to invite individuals, universities, academic, fi nancial and Islamic institutions throughout the world to nominate whoever they deem eligible to be awarded the IDB Prize for the year 1439H (2018G) in the fi eld of Islamic Banking and Finance.

NancyDupree waslookingforpapers. Anypa-pers. Magazines, UNreports, newspapersproduced byrival factionsofthe mujahi-deen, posters, comics, photographs. Itdidn’tmatteriftheyhad been used to lightaﬁre, orwrap meat; iftheywere legible,she wanted them. Anygoddamn thing, aslongasithad to do with Afghanistan. Hertaskwasone she would neverhavestarted on, had she notfallen crazily in lovewith thatpoor, war-ravaged, beautifulland. She wasreconstructing, documentbydocument, the recenthistoryofAfghan-istan from the Sovietinvasion in 1979.Those were timesto passoverin silence, asfarasAfghanistan’stextbookswere con-cerned: the yearsofSovietoccupation, therise ofthe warlords, the American inva-sion and the Taliban takeover, a period ofsuch chaosthateven she, who had livedthere fordecades, had leftforPeshawarand America. Butshe had notforgotten. The destination ofthose thousands ofpapers, aftertheyhad been putin sacksand senton horsebackthrough the KhyberPass, wasa newbuildingon the campus ofKabul University, herown AfghanistanCentre. Amid the blast-wallsand quick-ﬁxbuildingsofthe newcity, hercentre wasbuiltofAfghan cedarand white Herat mar-ble in the style ofa qala, orfort, around acourtyard bounded with poplars. In thiscalm, traditional setting, Afghanscouldnowdiscovertheirown history. Ofcourse, ittookso much bloody time.Butshe kepton pushing, hustlingany min-isterwith Why? orWhynot? Fortunately,afterenough years, theyseemed to forgetthatshe waseithera foreignerora woman.In herown mind she wasjust“GeneralBusybody” or“Nuisance”, buthernet-workingprowesswasso notoriousthatshe wasonce approached, to see ifshecould help with permitsto digtunnels inKabul, bythe youngOsama bin Laden.Bysheerpersistence she gotenoughmoneyforhercentre, from Estonia andNorwayamongothers. Even Hamid Kar-zai, atone time presidentofAfghanistan,helped to raise $2.5m forit. Ifa people didnotknowtheirhistory, she keptsaying, iftheydid notrevere theirculture orcare forthe monumentsaround them, theirnationcould notstayalive.She had embarked on thiswork—soonafterarrivingin Kabul in 1962, asthe boredbutgiddywife ofan American diplomat—bywritingthe ﬁrst-everguide to the mag-niﬁcentBamiyan Buddhas. Howcouldthere be no guide? she cried to the tourismminister. Itwasa scandal. Nothalfas bigascandal, atleastin Kabul, asherwild cock-tail-partyingaﬀairwith LouisDupree, amarried archaeologist. Butshe rode thatout, and married him. Louis’sotherlovewasAfghanistan’sprehistory; he had un-earthed the oldesttoolsand artever foundin the country. She added to thatbyde-scribing, in ﬁve booksand manyarticles,Afghanistan’srich Greekand Buddhistpastsaswell asitsIslamicone, and the trea-suresthatremained from each ofthem. Butthismixed historyonlyenraged theIslamistfanaticswho emerged victoriousafterthe Sovietyears. In 2001theyblewupherbeloved Bamiyan Buddhas, leavingjusta stump. The National Museum washitbyrocketﬁre, reducingmanyartefactsto dustand openingthe restto looters. Shewrote a reporton the destruction, reckon-ingthat70% ofthe collection had gone. Butgiven the historyofthisplace, anythingcould fall victim atanytime eitherto a mul-lah with matchesoran American bomb;and once somethingwasthoroughlybro-ken in Afghanistan, itseemed prettyHumpty-Dumptyish to tryto mend it. The bestsolution she knewwastomake Afghanscare abouttheirpast: notjustthe elite in Kabul, butalso the countrypeople whom the elite ignored. True, somecould notread orwrite, buttheywerebright, open-minded and thirstingto learn.So hercentre sentoutboxesﬁlled withpamphletsand bookson health, nutritionand farming, aswell ashistory, aslendinglibrariesforvillages. Yes, the governmentjibbed atit, and yes, she knewfrom tediousvisitswith bearded eldersthatsometimesthe boxeswere justlocked away, buteverybookthatgotthrough wasprogress. Tea and sympathyItwasalso an actoflove—asherwhole ca-reerwas. Louishad taunted her, in his pro-fane, charming, cavalierway, into doingmore guidebooks, and hisred Land Roverhad taken herall overheradopted country.He had taughtherthe prehistory, but hehad also started the greatcollection ofpa-persfrom the waryears. Afterhisdeath in1989 she wenton with it, aswell asthe li-brariesforthe countrypeople, because ofwhathe wanted. Beside him, withouthim,she wasjusta piﬄinglittle shadow. GoodGod, wasshe even still alive? “GrandmotherofAfghanistan” (asmanyfondlycalled her) wasnota bad title,though. She could be that. She recalledhowonce some village women hadbroughthertheirgummy-eyed childrenand asked forpenicillin forthem. Instead,like some wise woman ofthe hills, she sug-gested applyingstrong, fresh-brewed tea. Itworked. And she thought, lookingatthebabiesthen, thatthere wasnothingsolovelyasopened Afghan eyes. 7The land ofloveNancyHatch Dupree, “the grandmotherofAfghanistan”, died on September10th,aged 89ObituaryNancy Dupreeeconomistsubscriptions.com/1843October/November issue on newsstands September 20thANGELINA’S  CAMBODIAN DRAMAWhen children change gender Couture’s Aussie upstartsEurope’s heart of darkness Fabergé’s potatoFilming in the Killing FieldsThe award-winning magazine of ideas, lifestyle and cultureAlways one step ahead of the game.HYUNDAI is a registered trademark of Hyundai Motor Company.
