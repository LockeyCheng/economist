BusinessThe EconomistNovember18th201711TWO yearsago the worldpledged to keep globalwarming“well below” 2°Chot-terthan pre-industrial times. Cli-mate scientistsand campaign-erspurred. Politicianspattedthemselveson the back. Despitethe Parisagreement’sambigu-itiesand some setbacks, includingPresidentDonald Trump’sdecision to yankAmerica outofthe deal, the airofself-congrat-ulation wasstill on showamongthose who gathered in Bonnthismonth fora follow-up summit. Yetthe mostdamagingthingaboutAmerica’srenewedspasm ofclimate-change rejection maynotbe the eﬀect on itsown emissions, which could turn outto be negligible. ItisthecoverAmerica hasgiven othercountriesto avoid acknowledg-ingthe problemsofthe agreementAmerica isabandoning. The Parisagreementassumes, in eﬀect, thatthe world willﬁnd waysto suckCO2outofthe air. Thatisbecause, in anyreal-isticscenario, emissionscannotbe cutfastenough to keep thetotal stockofgreenhouse gasessuﬃcientlysmall to limittherise in temperature successfully. Butthere isbarely anypublicdiscussion ofhowto bringaboutthe extra “negative emis-sions” needed to reduce the stockofCO2(and even lessaboutthe more radical idea ofloweringthe temperature byblockingoutsunlight). Unlessthatchanges, the promise oflimiting theharm ofclimate change isalmostcertain to be broken.Don’tbe so positiveFully101ofthe 116 modelsthe Intergovernmental Panel on Cli-mate Change usesto chartwhatliesahead assume that carbonwill be taken outofthe airin orderforthe world to have a goodchance ofmeetingthe 2°Ctarget. The total amountofCO2to besoaked up by2100 could be a staggering810bn tonnes, asmuchasthe world’seconomyproducesin 20 yearsattoday’srate(see page 20). Puttingin place carbon-removal schemesof thismagnitude would be an epicendeavoureven iftried-and-test-ed techniquesexisted. Theydo not. Afewpowerstationsand industrial facilitiescapture CO2thatwould otherwise end up in the airand store itawayunderground, a practice known ascarbon capture andstorage. Butthislong-touted approach to cuttingemissions stilloperateson onlya verysmall scale, dealingwith just a fewtensofmillionsoftonnesofCO2a year. And such schemesmerelyloweremissions; theydo notreverse them. Whatmight? One option isto plantmore forests(which actasa carbon sink) orto replace the deep-ploughingof ﬁeldswith shallowtillage (which helpssoilsabsorb and retain moreCO2). Anotheristo applycarbon capture and storage to bio-mass-burningpowerplants, stashingthe carbon sucked up bycropsortreesburntasfuel. Fancierideasexist. Carbon couldbe seized directlyfrom the air, usingchemical ﬁlters, andstored. Ormineralscould be ground up and sowed over landorsea, acceleratingfrom aeonsto yearsthe natural weatheringprocessthatbindsthem to CO2to form carbonate rocks.Whetheranyofthese technologiescan do the job in time isunknown. All ofthem are veryexpensive and none isprovenatscale. PersuadingEarth’sswellingpopulation to plantan In-dia’sworth ofnewtreesorcropsto produce energy, as the cli-mate simulationsrequire, lookshighlyimprobable. Changingagricultural practiceswould be cheaper, butscientists doubtthatthiswould suckup enough CO2even to oﬀsetthe green-house gasesreleased byfarming. Directaircapture and en-hanced weatheringuse lessland, butboth are costlier. Thoughrenewable energycould proﬁtablygenerate a fairshare oftheworld’selectricity, nobodyknowshowto getrich simply byre-movinggreenhouse gases.When the need isgreat, the science isnascentand commer-cial incentivesare missing, the taskfallsto government andprivate foundations. Buttheyare fallingshort. More science would serve asa collective insurance policyagainsta grave threat. However, thisyearBritain became justthe ﬁrstcountryto devote cash to such projects; America iseye-inggrants, too, despite MrTrump. Britain’sone-oﬀ£8.6m($11.3m)isfootling. Roughly$15bn a yeargoesto research intoall low-carbon technologies; thatpotneedsto increase, andmore ofitshould be channelled to extractingcarbon. Anotherform ofclimate denialAbigmarketforCO2would provide an extra incentive to mineitfrom the atmosphere. Butitsusesare still limited. Ifregula-torsforced industriesthatcannotconvertto electricity, such asaviation, to use syntheticfuelsratherthan fossil ones, demandforthe CO2thatisthe rawmaterial forthose fuelscould in-crease greatly. The industries, though, would resist. Ifthe marketwill notprovide an incentive, governmentscould. The case fora properprice on carbon (thispaper hasfa-voured a tax) isstrong. Itsabsence isone ofthe reasons carboncapture and storage hasnottaken oﬀasa wayofreducingemissionsfrom fossil-fuel plants; the kitneeded can doublethe price ofelectricity. Yet, settinga price high enough to en-courage negative emissionswould asphyxiate the economy. Subsidiesare anotheroption. Withoutthem, renewableswould have taken longerto compete with fossil fuels. Buttheyare wasteful. Germanyhaslavished $1trn on low-carbon elec-tricity, and even then still dependson fossil fuelsfor overhalfitspower. Still, governmentscould oﬀera reward for everytonne ofCO2thatisextracted and stored. In theorysuch abountyshould be paid from a fund bankrolled bycountries ac-cordingto theircumulative historical emissions(top comesAmerica followed byEurope, with China rapidlyclosing thegap). In practice no mechanism existsto getthem to cough up.Indeed, facingthe shortcomingsofParisisbeyond mostgovernments. UnderMrTrump, America isnotprepared to re-duce the ﬂowofemissions, letalone the stock. Butthe problemwould notmagicallybe solved even ifAmerica returned to thefold. Manyrich countriessaytheyare alreadydoingtheir bitbycuttingemissionsmore steeplythan developingcountries.In fact, takingcarbon dioxide from the atmosphere is notan al-ternative to belchingoutlessgreenhouse gas. Itisnecessary initsown right. Unlesspolicymakerstake negative emissions se-riously, the promisesofPariswill ringevermore hollow.7Whattheydon’ttell youStopping the ﬂowofcarbon dioxide into the atmosphere is notenough. Ithas to be sucked out, tooLeaders12LeadersThe EconomistNovember18th2017CALIGULAwanted to makehishorse consul. RobertMugabe wanted hiswife, Grace,to take overfrom him aspresi-dentofZimbabwe. The compar-ison isa bitunfair. Caligula’shorse did notgo on lavish shop-pingtripswhile Romansstarved; norwasitaccused ofassaultinganyone with an elec-triccable in a hotel room. Grace Mugabe’sonlyqualiﬁcationforhigh oﬃce washermarriage to MrMugabe, a man 41yearsherseniorwith whom she began an aﬀairwhile hisﬁrst wifewasdying. Herambitionswere thwarted thisweekwhen thearmyseized power, insistingthatthiswasnota coup whilemakingitperfectlyclearthatitwas(see page 39). Thus, sordidly, endsthe era ofone ofAfrica’sgreatdictators.MrMugabe hasmisruled Zimbabwe for37 years. AsThe Econo-mistwentto press, he wasin detention butunharmed. Even ifhe isallowed to keep histitle, hispowerisgone. At 93, frail andforgetful, he hasﬁnallylostcontrol ofthe country he ruined.The wonder—and the shame—isthathe lasted so long. There ismuch to learn from the failure ofhisrevolution.Coup de GraceMrMugabe wasonce widelyadmired (and still is, amongthose who thinkanti-imperialistrhetoricmattersmore thancompetence). He foughtagainstwhite rule in the 1970s, in whatwasthen called Rhodesia, and legitimatelywon an election in1980. He preached reconciliation with the white formerop-pressors. Buoyed byaid, global goodwill and good harvests,the newcountryofZimbabwe prospered fora while. Butlike so manyrevolutionaries, MrMugabe could not tol-erate anychallenge to hisrule. Viewingthe second-largest eth-nicgroup, the Ndebele, asdisloyal, he used a minorinsurrec-tion asan excuse to crush them. In 1983 he unleashed hisspecial forces(trained byNorth Korea) on the Ndebele, raping,torturingand murderingthousandsofcivilians. Survivors ofvillage massacreswere forced to dance on theirneighbours’massgraves, singingpraise to the rulingparty, Zanu-PF, in thelanguage ofthe Shona majority. Unlike, say, Saddam HusseinorIdi Amin, MrMugabe did notparticularlyenjoyviolence,buthe neverhesitated to use enough ofitto stayin power. Hisgrasp ofeconomicswasrevolutionaryin the worstsense. He liked the language ofsocialism because itlet himbosspeople around while posingasa champion ofthe poor.He spentpublicmoneywildly—some ofiton good things likeeducation, butmuch ofiton patronage. When he ran out ofcash, he started seizingthings, such aswhite-owned commer-cial farms, and givingthem to hissupporters. Hisdisregard forpropertyrightsscared oﬀinvestors. He printed money to paythe armyand the civil service, sparkinghyperinﬂation so se-vere that, atone point, Z$1trn would notbuya boiled sweet. Hetried to ﬁghtinﬂation with price controls, causing shopsto runoutofbasicgoods. All the while hiscroniesgleefully looted thecountry’spublicpurse and diamond mines. AfternearlyfourdecadesofMrMugabe, Zimbabweansare on average a ﬁfthpoorer. Thisyeara quarterofthe population were short offood; perhaps3m-5m outof17m have emigrated in despair.Will the coup improve matters? Itishard to be optimistic.Coupsare neverlegal and usuallyspread misery. The generalsand ruling-partyold guard who engineered thisone are notre-formers; theyare partofthe grubbysystem MrMugabecreated. Manyhave proﬁted handsomelyfrom it, and inter-vened thisweeknotoutofprinciple butto stop MrsMugabeand heryoungersupportersfrom takingtheirplacesat thetrough. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the 75-year-old man whomayend up in charge, isa longtime Mugabe loyalistand everybitasnastyashisex-boss. (He wassecurityminister duringtheNdebele massacres; duringan election campaign in 2000 hissupportersburned hisopponent’shome down.) Thisblood-stained crewofplottersmake unlikelynational saviours.Abig ditch to climb outofNonetheless, there isa sliverofhope. Zimbabwe’srulingelitehave longhonoured the formsofdemocracy, and have occa-sionallylostelectionsdespite cheatingon a grand scale. MrMnangagwa maybe a thug, buthe isa pragmaticone, free ofthe Messiah complexthatcaused MrMugabe to lose touchwith reality. He knowsthatthe treasuryisempty, and thatZim-babwe needsurgenthelp from donorssuch asthe IMF. He hasputoutfeelersto the opposition. He talksofending some ofMrMugabe’swoeful policies, such asthe lawrequiringall compa-niesabove a certain size to be majority-owned byblack Zim-babweans(in practice, ruling-partyfatcats). An election isdue to be held bythe middle ofnext year. Anyaid to a new, transitional governmentshould be conditionalon a free and fairballot. Exiles, whose remittanceshave savedcountlessZimbabweansfrom destitution, should be allowedto vote. The pollsshould be monitored byneutral observerssuch asthe UNand the EU. South Africa will no doubtplay arole in the transition, butitmaynotbe a constructive one un-derJacob Zuma—anotherrulerwho toleratesgrotesque cor-ruption and wantsto puthisformerwife on the throne. China,which propped up MrMugabe fora while butthen decided hewasa deadbeat, hasnotmade itsintentionsknown. There are two moralsto drawfrom MrMugabe’slong, igno-miniouscareer. The ﬁrstisthatbad policies, corruptly imple-mented, can wrecka countrywith alarmingspeed and go onwreckingitlongafteryouwould have thoughtthere was noth-ingleft. Venezuela haslittle in common with Zimbabwe cultur-ally, buthasalso achieved disastrousresultsbyembracing aLatin version ofMugabenomics. Bycontrast, Botswana, Zim-babwe’sculturallysimilarbutwell-governed neighbour, wasroughlyasrich in 1980 butisnowseven timesricher. The second moral isthat, forall itsdisappointments, de-mocracyremainsthe bestantidote forbad rulers. Had Zimba-bweansbeen allowed to choose, theywould have tossed MrMugabe and hishenchmen outlongago. Were there an honestvote now, hissuccessorwould startoutwith real legitimacy.The world hasabandoned Zimbabwe to itsfate too manytimesbefore. Thistime, outsidersshould oﬀera hand to help itclimb outofthe ditch into which MrMugabe drove it.7Acoup in ZimbabweFall ofthe dictatorAfter37 years RobertMugabe has been sidelined bythe army.

One reason local governmentsin China are dysfunctionalisthe waytheirﬁnanceswork(see page 28). Theyhave verylimited tax-raisingpowersoftheirown. Issuingbonds requirestrickyhigh-level approval. Much ofwhattheyraise has to behanded overto the centre, which then redistributesmoneybackto the provinces—supposedlyaccordingto theirneeds. Tosee howwell thatworks, compare the shabbystate-runschoolsand hospitalsofrural countieswith theirsmart coun-terpartsin wealthycities. No wonderlocal oﬃcials often turnto dodgywaysofgeneratingcash, such asusingshadowy “ﬁ-nancingvehicles” to borrowmoneyfrom banks.Atthe rootofall thisisdisharmonybetween central and lo-cal governments. Youmightthinkthat, in China ofall places,the centre reigned supreme. Ata CommunistPartycongresslastmonth, itsleader, Xi Jinping, acquired even greater powerbyﬁllingjobswith hisallies.

Both girlsand boysare lessconstrained bytheirsexthan everbefore. Wom-en can notonlyvote and ownproperty, butstand forelection and run companies. Men cancare forchildren—and fortheirappearance. Both sexes are freeto love, and in manycountriesmarry, whomevertheywish.Butforsome, even today’scapaciousgenderrolesdo not ﬁt.The numberoftransgenderadults—those who do notidentifywith the sexon theirbirth certiﬁcates—seemsto be rising (seepage 51). More are changingtheirnames, clothingand pro-nouns, takingcross-sexhormonesand seekinggender-reassignmentsurgery. Theirrightsand statushave become thecasusbelli forthe latestculture war.The ﬁercestﬁre isleft-on-left. Some feministsreject theclaim thattranswomen (people registered male atbirth whohave made the transition to a female identity) are indeedwomen, ratherthan men who eschewstereotypicallymalebehaviour. Butto transpeople beingthus“misgendered” feelsdownrightcruel. Such feministsare called “transphobes” andaccused ofhate speech. The hard wordsﬂyboth ways: witnessGermaine Greerdeclaringthat“justbecause youlop oﬀyourdick” doesnotmake youa woman.None ofthisisedifying. Whatisunforgivable isthat chil-dren are caughtin the crossﬁre. Soaringnumbersare seekinghelp forgenderdysphoria—the distressingconviction that thesexon theirbirth certiﬁcate isthe wrongone. Ifthey are un-lucky, whathappensnextwill have more to do with an adultbattle overidentitythan with whatisrightforthem.Genderreassignmentisa momentouschoice, since itcausesirreversible physical changesand, ifsurgeryis done toreshape the genitalia, perhapsalso sterility. Forgender-dys-phoricchildren the clockisticking, since pubertymoulds bo-diesin waysno drugsorscalpel can undo. Waitinguntil adult-hood to startthe transition therefore meansworse results. Some clinicsbuytime with puberty-blockers, which sup-pressthe action ofsexhormones. Butthese mayhave harmfulside-eﬀects. Furthermore, mostgender-dysphoricchildrenwill probablynotbecome transgenderadults. Studiesarescarce and small, butsuggestthat, withouttreatment, a maj-oritywill end up comfortable in theirbirth sex, so treatmentwould be harmful. Unfortunately, no one knowshowto tellwhich group iswhich. Yetsome transactivistshave throwncaution to the wind. Specialistswho startbytryingto help gen-der-dysphoricchildren settle in theirbirth identities, ratherthan makinga speedyswitch, riskbeinglabelled transphobesand forced outoftheirjobs. Feware willingto saythat somesuch children mayactuallybe suﬀeringfrom a diﬀerent under-lyingproblem, such asanorexia ordepression.Won’tsomeone thinkofthe children?Itisbad enough thatdoctors, parentsand gender-dysphoricchildren mustmake high-stakeschoicesagainsttime withoutgood evidence aboutwhatwill happen. Worse isthatchil-dren’splightisbeingused byadultsasan opportunity formor-al grandstanding. The child’sinterestsdepend noton the feel-ingsoftransgenderactivists—northose offeminists—but onfactsthatstill need to be established. Doctorsneed to knowmore abouthowto tell when genderdysphoria islikely to per-sist. Until theyhave thatinformation, theyshould not rush inwith drugs. Before acting, doctorsshould have reasonablegroundsforthinkingthattheyare doinggood. 7Transgender identityCaughtin the crossﬁreChildren are the mostvulnerable victims ofthe latestidentity-driven culture warIncumbentshave good reason to hoard the bestspots onthe schedule. Theyare allocated accordingto IATA’sguidelinesatno cost, butthe moneytheygenerate goesto the carrier. Ashortage oflandingslotsin Europe inﬂatesthe fares passengerspayatbusytimesby€2.1bn ($2.5bn) a year, accordingto SEOAmsterdam Economics, a consultancy, and Cranﬁeld Univer-sity. Thatextra moneyﬂowsstraightto the luckyairlines. Carri-erscan also sell some slots. The moneyon oﬀerforslots withgenuine scarcityvalue isastonishing, especiallyamong hubairlinesthatrelyon a central airportto transferconnecting pas-sengers. LastyearAirFrance-KLM, a legacycarrier, sold a singledailylandingand take-oﬀslotatLondon Heathrow, Europe’smostcongested airport, to Oman Airfor$75m. The slotsowned byMonarch are worth an estimated £60m ($79m).None ofthisisfair, neutral ortransparent. Legacy carrierscan pocketthe proceedsfrom plum slotstheydid notpay for.Upstartsare keptata distance, unable to compete for the ser-vicesthatconsumersprize most. The value ofslotsis obscure.Abettersolution would be slotauctions, in which carriersbid to hold slotsforstaggered periodsofﬁve orten years. Regu-latorsin America and China have thoughtaboutthissort ofapproach. An alternative would be to adopta congestion-pric-ingmodel forrunways, in which airlinespaymore to land ortake oﬀatbusiertimesofthe daythan quieterones. Facinghighercostsforusingprized early-morningslots, airlineswould have a greaterincentive to ﬁll planesto capacity and togetrid ofslotstheycannotuse. The extra moneycould be putinto a central infrastructure potto build more airport capacity.AirfairNo system isperfect. The sumsofmoneyneeded to be paid up-frontto win an auction, given the necessityofdoing so forhubcarriers, maybe too high fornewﬁrms. The burden of makingpaymentscould destabilise the ﬁnancesofsome carriers. Ifcongestion chargestrulyreﬂectthe scarcityvalue of a runwayslotata crowded airport, farescould rise. Airlines’ share priceswould certainlyfall. Butthe case forchange isnonethelessclear.

ANDY ARMSTRONGEdinburgh7Letters20The EconomistNovember18th20171SWEDEN’Sparliamentpassed a lawinJune which obligesthe countryto have“no netemissions” ofgreenhouse gasesinto the atmosphere by2045. The clue is inthe wording. Thisdoesnotmean thatthreedecadesfrom nowSwedesmustemitnoplanet-heatingsubstances; even ifall theirelectricitycame from renewablesand theyonlydrove Teslas, theywould presumablystill wantto ﬂyin aeroplanes, oruse ce-mentand fertiliser, the makingofwhich re-leasesplentyofcarbon dioxide. Indeed,the lawonlyrequiresgrossemissions todrop by85% compared with 1990 levels.Butitdemandsthatremainingcarbonsourcesare oﬀsetwith newcarbon sinks.In otherwordsgreenhouse gaseswill needto be extracted from the air. Sweden’spledge isamongthe world’smostambitious. Butifthe global tempera-ture isto have a good chance ofnotrisingmore than 2oC above itspre-industrial lev-el, asstipulated in the Parisclimate agree-mentof2015, worldwide emissionsmustsimilarlyhit“netzero” no laterthan 2090.Afterthat, emissionsmustgo “netnega-tive”, with more carbon removed from thestockthan isemitted. Thisisbecause whatmattersto the cli-mate isthe total amountofcarbon dioxidein the atmosphere. To keep the tempera-ture belowa certain level meanskeepingwithin a certain “carbon budget”—allow-ingonlyso much to accumulate, and nomore. Once youhave spentthatbudget,youhave to balance all newemissionswith removals. Ifyouoverspend it, the factthatthe world takestime to warm upmeansyouhave a briefopportunityto putthingsrightbytakingoutmore than youare puttingin (see chart1on nextpage). Beingable to remove carbon dioxidefrom the atmosphere is, therefore, a crucialelementin meetingclimate targets. Of the116 modelsthe Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC) looksatto chart theeconomicallyoptimal pathsto the Parisgoal, 101assume “negative emissions”. Noscenariosare atall likelyto keep warmingunder1.5oC withoutgreenhouse-gasre-moval. “Itisbuiltinto the assumptions ofthe Parisagreement,” saysGideon Hender-son ofOxford University.Climate scientistslike MrHendersonhave been discussingnegative-emissionstechnologies(NETs) with economistsandpolicywonkssince the 1990s. Theirdebatehasturned liveliersince the Parisagree-ment, the phrasingofwhich stronglysug-geststhatcountrieswill need to inventnewsinksaswell ascuttingemissions. Butso farpoliticianshave largelyignored theissue, preferringto focuson curbing cur-rentﬂowsofgreenhouse gasesinto the at-mosphere. NETswere conspicuousbytheirabsence from the agenda ofthe annu-al UN climate jamboree which ended inBonn on November17th.In the shortterm thismakessense. Themarginal costofreducingemissionsis cur-rentlyfarlowerthan the marginal cost oftakingcarbon dioxide straightfrom the at-mosphere. Butclimate isnota short-termgame. And in the longterm, ignoringtheneed fornegative emissionsiscomplacentatbest. The eventual undertaking, after all,will be gargantuan. The median IPCCmodel assumessuckingup a total of810bntonnesofcarbon dioxide by2100, equiva-lentto roughly20 yearsofglobal emissionsatthe currentrate. To have anyhope ofdo-ingso, preparationsforlarge-scale extrac-tion oughtto begin in the 2020s.ModellersfavourNETsthatuse plantsbecause theyare a tried and true technol-ogy. Reforestinglogged areasor“aﬀorest-ing” previouslytreelessonespresents nogreattechnical challenges. More controver-sially, theyalso tend to invoke “bioenergywith carbon capture and storage” (BECCS).In BECCS, powerstationsfuelled bycropsthatcan be burned to make energyhavetheircarbon-dioxide emissionsinjectedinto deep geological strata, ratherthan re-leased into the atmosphere. The technologyfordoingthe CCSpartofBECCShasbeen around fora while;some scenariosforfuture energygenera-tion relyheavilyon it. Butso farthere areonly17 CCSprogrammesbigenough to dis-pose ofaround 1m tonnesofcarbon diox-ide a year. PromotingCCSisan uphillstruggle, mainlybecause itdoublesthecostofenergyfrom the dirtypowerplantswhose ﬂuesitscrubs.

Af-ﬁxed to bioenergygeneration, though, CCSdoessomethingthatotherformsofgener-ation cannot. The carbon which the plantsthatserve asfuel originallytookfrom theatmosphere above issentinto the rocks be-low, makingita negative emitter.The problem with aﬀorestation andBECCSisthatthe plantsinvolved need ahuge amountofland. The area estimatedrangesfrom 3.2m square kilometres(roughlythe size ofIndia) to asmuch as9.7m square kilometres(roughlythe size ofCanada). Thatisthe equivalentofbetween23% and 68% ofthe world’sarable land. Itmaybe thatfuture agricultural yields canbe increased so dramaticallythat, even in aworld with atleast2bn more mouthstofeed, the area ofitsfarmscould be halved,and thatthe farmersinvolved mightbehappywith thisturn ofevents. Butit seemshighlyunlikely—and blithelyassuming itcan be done isplainlyreckless.Negative thinkingLessland-intensive alternativesexist—atleaston paper. Some are lowtech, likestimulatingthe soil to store more carbonbylimitingorhaltingdeep-ploughing. Oth-ersare lessso, such ascontraptions to seizecarbon dioxide directlyfrom the air, ormethodsthataccelerate the natural weath-eringprocessesbywhich mineralsin theEarth’scrustbind atmosphericcarbonoveraeonsorthatintroduce alkaline com-poundsinto the sea to make itabsorb morecarbon dioxide. Accordingto JenniferWilcoxofthe Col-orado School ofMines, and hercolleagues,the technologywith the second-highesttheoretical potential, afterBECCS, isdirectaircapture (see chart2 on nextpage). ThisusesCCS-like technologyon the open air,ratherthan on exhaustgases. The problemisthatthe concentration ofcarbon dioxidein the air, while veryhigh byhistoricalstandards, isverylowbychemical-engi-neeringones: just0.04%, asopposed to the10% ormore oﬀered bypower-plantchim-neysand industrial processessuch as ce-ment-making. The technologiesthatexisttoday, underdevelopmentbycompaniessuch asGlo-bal Thermostatin America, Carbon Engi-neeringin Canada orClimeworksofSwit-zerland, remain pricey. In 2011a reviewbythe American Physical Societyto whichMsWilcoxcontributed putextraction costsabove $600 pertonne, compared with anaverage estimate of$60-250 forBECCS.Enhanced weatheringisatan even ear-lierstage ofdevelopmentand costsare stillharderto assess. Estimatesrange from $25pertonne ofcarbon dioxide to $600. Onaverage, 2-4 tonnesofsilicate minerals (ol-ivine, sometimesused in Finnish saunasbecause itwithstandsrepeated heatingand cooling, isa favourite) are needed foreverytonne removed. To extract5bntonnesofcarbon dioxide a yearmayre-quire up to 20bn tonnesofmineralsthatmustbe ground into ﬁne dust. Grinding isenergy-intensive. Distributingthe powderevenly, on land orsea, would be a logisticalchallenge to putitmildly.Ideasabound on a small scale, in labsorin researchers’ heads, butthe biggerme-chanical schemesin existence todaycap-ture a paltry40m tonnesofcarbon dioxideayear. Mostinvolve CCS and have prevent-ed more carbon dioxide escapinginto theatmosphere from fossil-burningpowerplants, ratherthan removingit. Removing8bn-10bn tonnesby2050, asthe more san-guine scenariosenvisage, letalone the35bn-40bn tonnesin more pessimisticones, will be a vastundertaking.Progresswill be needed on manyfronts. All the more reason to testlots oftechnologies. Forthe time beingeven re-searcherswith a horse in the race are un-willingto beton a winner. Pete Smith ofAberdeen UniversityspeaksformanyNETsexpertswhen he saysthat“none isasilverbullet, and none hasa fatal ﬂaw.”Itwill also notcome cheap. WITCH,constructed byMassimo Tavoni ofPolitec-nico di Milano, isa model which analysesclimate scenarios. Unlike mostsimula-tions, italso estimateshowmuch research-and-developmentfundingisnecessarytoachieve roll-outatthe sortofscale thesemodelsforecast.Forall low-carbon tech-nologies, itputsthe ﬁgure at$65bn a yearuntil 2050, fourtimesthe sum thatrenew-ables, batteriesand the like attract today.MrTavoni saysa chunkofthatwould obvi-ouslyneed to go to NETs, which currentlygetnextto nothing.Even the lessspeculative technologiesneed investmentrightaway. Treestake de-cadesto reach theircarbon-suckingpoten-tial, so large-scale plantingneedsto startsoon, notesTim SearchingerofPrincetonUniversity.Directaircapture in particularlooksexpensive. Boostersnote thata fewyearsago so did renewables. Before tech-nological progressbroughtpricesdown,manycountriessubsidised renewable-en-ergysourcesto the tune of$500 pertonneofcarbon dioxide avoided and often spenthuge sumson it. Christoph Gebald, co-founderofClimeworks, saysthat“the ﬁrstdata pointon ourtechnological learningcurve” is$600, atthe lowerend ofpreviousestimates. Butlike the price ofsolar panels,he expectshiscoststo drop in the comingyears, perhapsto aslowas$100 pertonne. However, the fallingprice ofsolar pan-elswasa resultofsurgingproduction vol-umes, which NETswill struggle to repli-cate. AsOliverGeden ofthe GermanInstitute ofInternational and Security Af-fairsobserves, “Youcannottell the green-growth storywith negative emissions.” Amarketexistsforrooftop solarpanels andelectricvehicles; one forremovingan in-visible gasfrom the airto avertdisaster de-cadesfrom nowdoesnot.Much ofthe gascaptured byClime-worksand otherpure NETsﬁrms(asop-posed to fossil-fuel CCS) issold to makersofﬁzzydrinksorgreenhousesto helpplantsgrow.

Barelyhidinga sense of relief, ifnottriumph, Malcolm Turnbull, the primeminister, called the result“overwhelm-ing”. He promised thata parliamentaryvote to legalise gaymarriage would followbyChristmas.Atralliesaround the country, suppor-tersofchange cheered the prospect. But theissue haslongdivided MrTurnbull’scon-servative Liberal Party. The Marriage Actoriginallyleftthe meaningofmarriage un-deﬁned. John Howard, a Liberal primeminister, had itamended in 2004 to speci-fy“the union ofa man and a woman”. Aleaderofhisparty’sprogressive wing,MrTurnbull once favoured reversingthischange with a parliamentaryvote. But asadelayingtacticTonyAbbott, MrTurnbull’spredecessor, proposed a non-bindingpleb-iscite.

Itdid notrequire parliamentaryapproval,since itwasnota formal vote. YetAustra-lianstookitseriously. Almostfour-ﬁfths of16m eligible votersparticipated. David Ka-lisch, the head ofthe statistical bureau thatoversawthe proceedings, callsthis“out-standingfora voluntarysurveyand wellabove othervoluntaryexercisesconduct-ed around the world”.The campaign washard-fought. In full-page newspaperadvertisementsMrHow-ard warned ofthreatsto “parental rights,freedom ofspeech and religiousfreedom”ifAustraliansvoted forgaymarriage. TheAnglican church in Sydneydonated A$1m($760,000) to the No campaign. AlanJoyce, the openlygayhead ofQantas, Aus-tralia’sbiggestairline, donated A$1m ofhisown moneyto the Yescamp. JenniferWest-acott, the head ofthe BusinessCouncil ofAustralia, a lobbygroup, declared that shehad been in a same-sexrelationship for 30yearsand had “spentmywhole life feelinglike an outsider”. The focuswill nowshiftto parliament.Dean Smith, an openlygayLiberal mem-berofthe Senate (the upperhouse), intro-duced a bill to allowgaymarriage withinhoursofthe surveyresult. The oppositionLaborPartysupportsit. Liberals, previous-lybound bytheirparty’sopposition to gaymarriage, will nowhave a free vote. JamesPaterson, a conservative Liberal,wantsnotonlyclergy(asin MrSmith’sbill)butalso businessesto be free to refuse toparticipate in gayweddings.

So preciousis thedelicacyto localsthattravellersat Kol-kata’sairporthave to be reminded that“Liquidsabove 100ml (IncludingRoso-golla) are NotAllowed”.ItwasnotjustBengali ego thatwas onthe line. India passed a lawto protect geo-graphical indicationsin 1999. In 2004 itreg-istered itsﬁrstprotected productwith theWTO: Darjeelingtea, anotherprized itemfrom Bengal. Darjeeling’ssmall estateswere tired ofseeingtheirgood name usedto sell inferiorteasabroad.

Butthe state ofMadhya Pra-desh, which includesa tinycornerof theGangesbasin, wantsitsrice-growersto beable to use the name.

Localities, however,keep pushingback.known asa “local governmentﬁnancingvehicle”, orLGFV. Such ﬁrmsused state-owned land and sharesin local state ﬁrmsascollateral to raise moneyfrom banks, thebond marketand consumers. The purpose ofthisborrowingwas usu-allyto build houses, roadsand other infra-structure. Butitwaslargelyunregulated.LGFVswere notbanks,so theywere notsubjectto the same ﬁnancial rules. Neitherwere theylocal-governmentdepartments,which are subjectto central controls. Theywere setup asstate-owned enterprises,which allowed them to ignore budgetcon-straintsand often to keep theirbalance-sheetshidden from publicview. Kicking the tyresAlarmed bythe growth ofLGFVs, the cen-tral governmentsetoutto investigate. In2013 itcounted over10,000 ofthem andcalculated theirtotal borrowingat7trnyuan ($1.1trn, or13% ofGDP). MainlandChina has31provinces, 330 prefecturesand2,800 county-level administrations, so thisworksoutatmore than three perjurisdic-tion. Atthe end of2015 total local-govern-mentdebt, mostlyinvolvingLGFVs,amounted to 15trn yuan, or24% ofGDP.Compared with China’stotal outstandingcredit, amountingto 250% ofGDP atthattime, thiswasnotsuch a bigshare. ButmostborrowingbyLGFVswas“oﬀbud-get”, thatis, unreported. Ithad explodedduringthe previousdecade. In 2014 the central governmentbegantryingto sortoutthe messbybanning localauthoritiesfrom raisingmoneythrough ﬁ-nancingvehicles. Instead, itsaid, theycould issue bondsand use the moneyto re-ﬁnance LGFV debt. By2018 all such debt issupposed to be converted into bonds. Thisimpliesissuingabout15trn yuan, a hugeamount. Byputtinglocal borrowingontothe books, the governmenthopesto bringsome transparencyto the debtproblem. ByUnderChina’speculiarﬁscal system,local governments—those atprovincial,cityand countylevels—have strictlylimit-ed revenue-raisingpowers. Until 2014 theycould notborroworissue bondswithoutthe centre’spermission. Localitiesdependon ﬁxed sharesofcertain taxes: 50% ofval-ue-added tax, forexample, and 40% ofper-sonal income tax.The share isneverenough.

The national governmentbeganto include assessmentsoflocal oﬃcials’borrowingdecisionsin theirannual per-formance reviews. Theywould be held re-sponsible even aftermovingto anotherarea. The centre also banned some dodgyincentivesthatlocal governmentshadused to attractprivate investors. Most am-bitiously, the ﬁve-yearplan foreconomicdevelopmentthattookeﬀectin 2016 prom-ised thatthere would be a newrevenue-and tax-sharingdeal between the centraland local levels. Itall made excellentsense. Yetin July2017 MrXi made clearthatthe ﬁxeswerenotworking. He told a conference on the ﬁ-nancial system thatlocal-governmentdebtwasstill one ofthe two biggestthreats toChina’sﬁnancial stability(the other wasdebtbuiltup bystate-owned ﬁrms). Theproblem wasthatlocal governmentswerestill usingeverytrickin the bookto dis-guise theirshenanigans.Houze Songofthe Paulson Institute, anAmerican think-tank, sayslocal oﬃcialshave been reclassifyingloansso they nolongerappearin oﬃcial statistics.

In principle,itoughtto be possible to make a clearer di-vision oftax-raisingpowersbetween thecentre and periphery, a prospectraised inthe ﬁve-yearplan and reiterated byMr Xi atapartycongressin October. Such a dealwould lessen the mismatch betweenspendingand revenues. In particularapropertytax, promised in 2013, would givelocal governmentsa newtaxbase. The trouble isthatcentral and local gov-ernmentsdo nottrusteach otherenoughto negotiate such a deal. To make mattersworse, theyhave drawn diﬀerentlessonsfrom the LGFV debtsaga. The centre thinkslocal authoritiesneed to be reined in, notgiven theirown taxbase. The peripheryseemsto have decided thatincreasinglyelaborate schemesare needed to defendwhatlittle ﬁnancial autonomytheyhave.Localitiesalso worrythata property taxmightlowerhouse prices—and no onewantsto be blamed forthat.MrXi haslongcomplained thatlocal of-ﬁcialsare obstructinghispoliciesand sayshe needsmore powersto force changesthrough. The partycongresshasgiven himthose. The local-debtcrisiswill be a testofwhetherhe plansto reform the system ofgovernmentin China, orwhetherhe willbe contentmerelyto have itstop layerstacked with hisallies. 7AFTERundergoinghypnosisata clinic inChongqing, PengYanhui—who goesbythe name Yanzi—wastold to lie on asofa, thinkabouthavingsexwith anotherman and move hisﬁngerifhe feltany emo-tional orphysical reaction. “Then, whenmyeyeswere closed, the clinician sudden-lyturned on the electroshockmachine,” herecalls. “I jumped up screamingloudly.When I said I wasscared, he justsmiledand said thatwaswhathe wanted.”Yanzi (pictured in 2014 outside a courtin Beijingatwhich he successfullysued theclinic) had good cause to be frightened. Buthe wasnotsurprised. Asa gay-rights activ-ist, he had volunteered forthe abusive“conversion” therapyto expose the preva-lence ofsuch treatmentsin China, whichmostdoctorsin developed countriescon-siderto be unethical and medicallyfalla-cious.

But, asinothercountries, pseudoscientiﬁcattemptsto “cure” gaypeople persist. In China,where there isa strongcultural belief in apatrilineal familysystem, itismainly menwho are subjected to such treatment. Mosturban parentshave onlyone child, partlyasa resultofonce strictfamily-planningrules. Iftheironlyson isgay, they fearthatthe familyline will be severed.Some ofthose who endure the therapyattemptsuicide, and some lie to their fam-iliesaboutwhatthe treatmenthasachieved, saysYingXin, directoroftheBeijingLGBT Centre, an advocacygroupforpeople who are lesbian, gay, bisexual ortransgender. She saysshe doesnotknowanyone forwhom the treatmenthasworked. “It’slike anyotherkind oftor-ture,” she says. “Some people eventuallysaywhatevertheyare pressured to say.”The courtthatheard Yanzi’scase did notrule thatthe treatmenthe wasgiven was it-selfillegal—onlythatthe clinician hadlacked a licence and had engaged in falseadvertisingbyoﬀeringa cure forsome-thingthatwasnotan illness.

Inthe ﬁve yearsfollowingthe end ofthe re-cession in June 2009 wagesand salariesrose byonly8.7%, while pricesincreased by9.5%. In 2014 the median worker’sinﬂa-tion-adjusted earnings, byone measure,were no higherthan theywere in 2000.

Dur-ingthose two years, poorerhouseholdsgained more, on average, than richerones.The latestdevelopment—one thatwill beofparticularinterestto MrTrump—is thatblue-collarwageshave begun to rocket.

TurkeyaccusesMrGulen ofmastermindinglastyear’sfailedcoup (chargesthe clericdenies) and haslongsoughthisreturn.The plan wasallegedlydiscussed dur-ingmeetingslate lastyearbetween MrFlynn, then a seniorcampaign adviser, andTurkish oﬃcials.

MrFlynn’sattorneycalled the allegations“outrageous” and “false”; Turkey’sembas-sycalled them “ludicrousand groundless.”Stephen Vladeck, a professoratthe Uni-versityofTexasspecialisingin national-se-curitylaw, saysthe allegationsagainst MrFlynn provide “the ﬁrstclearprospectofstate criminal charges”. The alleged plotwascooked up in NewYork; MrTrump canonlypardon federal crimes, and thuswould be unable to oﬀerMrFlynn thesame lifeline he could oﬀerPaul Manafort,MrTrump’sformercampaign chairman,and RickGates, a lobbyist, whom MrMuellerhasindicted on federal charges.Notto be outdone, JeﬀSessions, MrTrump’sattorney-general, then testiﬁedbefore the House JudiciaryCommittee.

The Obama administration con-vened a committee ofexpertsto do this in2009. Itbegan publishingestimatesthatyear. In March, PresidentDonald Trump is-sued an executive orderdisbandingthecommittee and withdrawingall ofitstech-nical guidance (ithad published social-costestimatesforothergreenhouse gaseslike methane and nitrousoxide too).Because regulationsare subjectto law-suits, MrPruittissomewhatconstrained inwhathe can do atthe EPA.

Thegrandson ofa coal minerand a steelworker, MrJoneswas borninto a familyofDemocrats. Butwhen the South wentRepublican,afterLyndon Johnson ended segregation in 1964, mostofthe Jo-neseswenttoo. “Mosteverybodyvoted Republican more thantheyvoted Democratin recentyears,” reﬂectsthe avuncular63-year-old, duringa recentcampaign pit-stop in Mobile. In otherwordsMrJones, who casthisﬁrstvote forJohnson’sRepublicansuccessor, Richard Nixon, isa Democratbychoice, notcultural in-heritance, which in turn giveshim an unusual grasp ofthe pas-sionsaroused acrossAmerica’spolitical divide. Given thathemustwoo thousandsofRepublican votersto have a prayer ofvic-toryin a state thatpicked Donald Trump overHillaryClinton by28 percentage points, thisisa useful advantage.Abiggerone, itmustbe admitted, isthatMrJones’sopponentisa gay-hating, Muslim-baiting, religiouszealot, who has twicebeen removed from hisposition asAlabama’schiefjustice fordisregardingthe constitution in favourofhisinterpretation oftheBible. Assoon asRoyMoore clinched the Republican nomina-tion, MrJones’schancesofmakinghistoryrose from roughlynon-existentto slim. FollowingrevelationsthatMrMoore alsohasa special fondnessforpost-pubescentgirls, theyare evens.Speakingthe dayafterfourwomen accused hisrival in theWashington Postofhittingupon ormolestingthem asteenagers,MrJoneswasreluctantto sayhowthismighthelp him. In thelightoffurtherallegations, includingthatMrMoore tried to forcehimselfupon a 16-year-old, itseemslikelyto help him a lot. MitchMcConnell sayshe believesMrMoore’saccusersand the judgeshould be replaced with a lessoﬀensive candidate; ifthat hap-pens, MrMoore’sname would remain on the ballot, potentiallysplittingthe Republican vote. The Republican National Commit-tee hasstopped supportingMrMoore’scampaign. Asked wheth-erhe would vote forhim, JeﬀFlake, a Republican senator, saidthathe would instead “run to the pollingplace to vote fortheDemocrat”. Opinion pollssuggestthe race istoo close to call. The Democratshave a recenthistoryofmistakingclementelectoral circumstancesfora compellingcandidate. Yet even be-fore MrMoore landed the Republican ticket, MrJones’sstrengthswere apparent.

Thishasgiven him ca-chetacrossAlabama’sracial gulf—which dividesblackand whiteDemocratsalmostasmuch asRepublicansand Democrats. Thisenabled MrJones, who wasendorsed earlyon byCongressmanJohn Lewisamongotherblackluminaries, to breeze through theDemocraticprimary.

Thatisdoublywise in Alabama, where the Democrats’ name ismudand recentscandalsin the state governmenthave made careerpoliticiansmore-than-usuallyhated. MrJones’spromise, oﬀeredlessin Trumpian furythan with the exasperation ofa frustratedcitizen, isto rise above destructive partisanship and deal witheconomicproblemsin a consensual fashion: “I thinkpeople areverytired ofthe gridlock…Theysee nothingbutchaos”.Asa peace oﬀeringto sceptical Republicans, thismessage im-pliesboth a desire to avoid unnecessaryﬁghts, and criticism ofMrJones’sown party. He describesthe health-care system asbro-ken, despite BarackObama’sreformsto it. He hasalso distancedhimselffrom Democraticleaders: he hasallowed onlyJoe Biden,an old friend, and MrLewisto campaign with him. Atthe sametime, covered byhiscallsfor“common ground”, he stateshisownprogressive positions—includingstaunchlypro-choice views in apro-life state—unapologetically. He saysthisisnotjust a matterofprinciple, butalso because votersdetesta phoney. “We can agreeto disagree. Butwhatyousee iswhatyouget.”Moral lessons from BamaWith manyDemocratsoutside Alabama arguingfora more bel-ligerent, left-wingplatform, there isa lotin MrJones’spragma-tism to admire. Indeed, forthose lookingfornational meaning inAlabama’scontest, thatisonlythe start. IfMrJoneswins, itwillpersuade Democratsthattheycan take control ofthe Senate nextyear. With the pollssuggestingthatMrJonesisrunning well inthe suburbsofBirmingham and with non-whites—a similar pat-tern to the recentDemocraticsweep in Virginia—itmight evenconvince them theyhave a shimmeringpath to recoveryacrossthe South. Thatwould transform American politics—notleast in aregion where single-partyrule hasbred torporand corruption. Ifthe admired MrJoneslosesto the reviled MrMoore, on the otherhand, such a recoverymightseem unimaginable.Buteven thatisnotthe main stake in Alabama. Sexual propri-etyand otherold-fashioned virtueshave taken a pummelling inAmerican politicsoverthe past18 months, and nowAlabamianshave an opportunityto startputtingthatright. MrMoore isunﬁt,incapable and repugnant. Hisopponent, who happensto be aDemocrat, though he doesn’talwayssound like one, isdecentand substantial.

MsYetgrievanceshave builtup. Chile’shy-brid welfare state, in which citizens oftenpartlypayforservicesprovided byprivateﬁrms, isa disappointmentto many. Newlymiddle-classChileansfearthatitdoes notprotectthem from slippingbackinto pov-erty. Lastyeartensofthousandsofpeopleprotested againstthe privatelymanagedpension system, which paysoutlowerbeneﬁtsthan some ofthe pensionershadhoped. “No more AFPs(pension-fundmanagers),” theydemanded. In 2011-13 stu-dentsheld demonstrationsagainstthe roleofthe private sectorin education. Chile’sdistribution ofincome ismoreunequal than in anyothermemberoftheOECD(a groupingofmostlyrich coun-tries), barIreland. Taxesand beneﬁts do lit-tle to correctthis, in contrastto most otherOECDnations. Chileansthinktheircoun-tryiscrime-ridden, even though itsmurderrate isamongthe lowestin Latin America.In MsBachelet’ssecond term, whichbegan in 2014, the countryentered a funk.Chile’spotential GDP growth rate hasdropped overthe pasttwo decadesfromabout5% a yearto 3-3.5%, in partbecausethe workforce hasaged and regulation dis-couragesinvestment. Overthe pastfouryearsgrowth hasaveraged lessthan 2%,partlybecause ofa fall in copperprices. Aseriesofreformsinitiated bythe pres-identdid notsolve these problems.

The damage to the publicpursesin padded contractsran to over$3bn. Theintangible costto the credibilityand pres-tige ofdemocraticpoliticsin Latin Ameri-ca isincalculable.The reverberationsfrom the Ode-brechtscandal come atthe worstpossibletime. Startingwith Chile on November19th, seven Latin American countrieswillchoose presidentsoverthe next12months. Theyinclude the two regionalgiants, Brazil and Mexico. An eighth, Ven-ezuela, isdue to vote byDecember2018,though itsdictator, NicolásMaduro, isun-likelyto allowa faircontest. Afurther sixpresidential ballotsare due in 2019, notleastin Argentina. The region’spoliticalfuture isup forgrabs.Latin Americansare beingcalled tovote justwhen pollsindicate thatthey aremore cynical abouttheirdemocraciesthan theyhave been for15 yearsorso.Largelybecause ofcorruption, there isastronganti-establishmentmood. Thepopulartemperhasnotbeen improvedbyworseningcrime in some countries,and byeconomicsluggishnessafteranearlierboom, which hasleftmanyLatinAmericanswith raised expectationsandstagnantincomes. All thishasstoked fearsofa resurgence ofpopulistnationalism—justwhen the region appeared to be shak-ingoﬀthe latestversion ofthis. Thatisa risk, notablyin Mexico whereAndrésManuel LópezObrador, a popu-listofthe left, leadsthe opinion pollsforJuly’selection. Butthere are otherfactors atwork. One isa move awayfrom the left,dominantformore than a decadein SouthAmerica, which began with Mauricio Ma-cri’striumph in Argentina in 2015. Thestrongshowingofhisbusiness-friendly co-alition in a congressional election in Octo-berconﬁrmed thattrend. Victoryfor Sebas-tián Piñera in Chile would extend it.Anothertendencyispolitical fragment-ation. The electionsin both Brazil (a dozenormore hopefuls) and Colombia (a score)are wide open. Thathasallowed outsiders,such asJairBolsonaro, an extreme right-wingpopulist, to ﬁgure in the early opin-ion pollsin Brazil. Fragmentation carriesanotherdanger. Newpresidentsmaystruggle to command a legislative majorityjustwhen the region needsreformsto re-turn to fastergrowth.Yetfragmentation doesnotmean thatﬁrebrandswill win. Because partyloyal-tiesare weaker, manyvotersare still unde-cided. Centristpartiesin Brazil and Mexicohave yetto settle on candidates; those whoemerge from the packwill see theirstand-ingin the pollsimprove. Middle-classLatin Americans, a biggershare ofthe electorate than in the past,tend to be angrieraboutcorruption thanthe poor, buttheyhave more to lose andmaythusbe intolerantofadventurism.Forthatreason, MrLópezObradorlost thepasttwo presidential electionsin Mexicoafterleadingin opinion polls. Main-stream media in Latin America have suf-fered lessfrom competition with digitaloutletsthan those in otherregions; theywill subjectoutsidersto interrogation. Even in an era ofweakened parties,political machinescan be decisive. Thatappliesin Paraguay’selection due inApril, where the rulingColorado Partyhasa tightgrip. In Honduras, which issetto vote on November26th, the conserva-tive incumbent, Juan Orlando Hernán-dez, obtained a questionable courtrulingallowinghim to run forre-election.

Arun-oﬀin Brazil could pitMrBolsonaro againstLuizInácio Lula da Sil-va, the left-wingformerpresidentwhohasbeen convicted ofcorruption (whichhe isappealingagainst). Yetcentrists arelikelyto do betterthan earlypollssuggest.

Although she unnerved investors,she calmed voters’ tempersbylimitingpo-litical spendingand introducingfree uni-versityforstudentsfrom familiesin thebottom halfofthe income scale. Herpro-posalsto raise more moneyforpensionshave quietened demandsto abolish AFPs.MsBachelet“managed a real crisisofgo-vernance”, saysEugenio Tironi ofTironiand Associates, aconsultancy. There is lesstalkofscrappingthe “neoliberal” model. Afewyearsago a political neophytelike MrGuilliermighthave been just whatvoterswere lookingfor. Buthe hasbeen anuninspiringcandidate, and hashad a hardtime explainingwhathe would do aspresi-dent, aside from addingan extra dash ofstate protection to MsBachelet’sreforms.SupportersofherNewMajoritycoalitionare splitbetween him and Carolina Goicofthe centristChristian Democrats. MsSánchez, who haseven lesspoliticalexperience than MrGuillier, himselfa sen-atoronlysince 2014, ismore credible as achange candidate. She would transformChile into a European-style welfare state,with much highertaxes. Butsupportforherhasdropped, perhapsbecause shescaresvoters. Franco Rodríguez, an engi-neeringstudent, agreeswith MsSánchezthatthe private sectorplaystoo big a role inpublicservicesbutthinksshe is“a popu-list”. He plansto vote forMsGoic. Mr Guil-lierhopesthe supportersofboth womenwill vote forhim in the second round. Thatwill probablynotbe enough todenyvictoryto MrPiñera. He isnotlovedand hasbeen deﬂectingcriticism in recentdaysofhis(legal) manoeuvresto lower hisown taxes. Apolitical allydescribes him as“an eﬃcientguy”, but“nota dreamer”.

Thatispartofa plan to spend anextra $14bn overfouryears, about1.4% ofGDPa year, on pensions, health, infrastruc-ture and education. Justhowhe means topayforthatisunclear; halfthe money willcome from “ineﬀective” programmesand“unnecessary” spending, he claims. Heplansto encourage investmentbysimpli-fyingcorporate taxesand cuttingred tape. Even ifhe wanted to, MrPiñera couldnotmove Chile sharplyto the right. Underan electoral reform enacted byMsBache-let’sgovernment, the nextcongressislikelyto be more diverse than the outgoingone,which isdominated byNewMajorityandChile Vamos. Whoeverthe nextpresidentiswill probablyhave to seeksupport fromoutside hisorhercoalition, eitherin a sta-ble coalition orlawbylaw. Chileans maybe cranky, butthe governmenttheyelectwill probablynotabandon the centre. 7THE ﬂurryofelectionscomingup in Lat-in America will notonlychoose newleaders. Itwill also provide a check-up onthe health ofdemocracyitself, which inmostcountrieson the continenthasbeenin place foronlya fewdecades. LatinAmericansappearto be losingsome oftheirenthusiasm forit. In the latest editionofthe region-wide surveyconducted an-nuallybyLatinobarómetro, a pollsterbased in Chile, the share ofrespondentssayingdemocracyisthe bestform ofgov-ernmenthititslowestlevel in a decade, at53% (in 2010 itwas61%). The proportionsayingtheyhad no preference fordemoc-racyoverothersystemsreached an all-time high of25%, up from 16% in 2010.HowworryingisthisforLatin Ameri-can democracy? One indicatorwill be vot-erturnout. Participation isonlya roughproxyforpolitical vibrancy. Some citizensmightstayhome because theyare satisﬁedwith theirgovernmentand conﬁdentthatitspolicieswill continue. Othersmightvote because theyexpectthata clientelisticgovernmentwill reward itsbackers.Nonetheless, there isa rough consensusamongpolitical scientiststhathealthy de-mocraciesand high turnoutoften go handin hand. When turnoutishigh, politiciansseekingre-election need to addressmorepeople’sconcerns. Thisisparticularlypressingin Latin America, where the poorand uneducated are leastlikelyto cast bal-lots. Governmentsin low-turnoutcoun-triesmaybe lessresponsive to their needi-estcitizens. Moreover, Latin Americanstateswith high voterparticipation havealso tended to score highlyon othermea-suresofdemocraticﬁtness, such ascivilrightsand regularalternation ofpower.Overall, Latin America hasperformedreasonablywell on turnout.

However, thisstabilitymaskswide variations. Since 1995, countriesinthe southern halfofSouth America haveboasted turnoutratesin the mid-70s, withUruguayleadingthe wayat87%. Colombiahasmanaged just43% (see chart).To determine whetherthe worrisomepollingtrendsportend an epidemicof elec-toral apathy, The Economisthasbuiltamodel thataimsto explain whyLatinAmerican turnoutratesdiﬀer. The biggestdeterminantsare rulesand the type ofelection. Turnoutis12 percentage pointslowerin non-presidential ballots. In coun-trieswhere votingismandatory, itis 11pointshigherthan where itisnot. The next-most-persistentpattern is thatelectoratesvote more when theyfeel theirdemocraciesare workingwell. Conversely,theyexpressdispleasure bystayinghomeorspoilingtheirballots, ratherthan byﬂockingto the polls. Countrieswhere peo-ple expressthe mostsupportfordemocra-cy, and particularlywhere theytrust politi-cal parties—which have get-out-the-voteoperations—lead the regional league table.These variablescan accountforchangeovertime within countries, too.

Youngerthan herhusband by41years, she plainlysoughtto inherit thethrone. Yetshe overplayed herhand. With-in a weekthe armed forces’ commander,alongside an arrayofgenerals, declared,withoutnamingher, thatMrsMugabemustbe stopped. He demanded, also with-outnamingnames, thathernemesis, Em-merson Mnangagwa, mustbe reinstated asheirapparent.

The Mugabe era wasatlastin-gloriouslyover. AsThe Economistwenttopress, eventswere still unfoldingpell-mell.Butthe latestsignalssuggestthatthe fate ofdepartmentin 1980 wasto visitthe policestation where he had been tortured by thewhite regime afterhiscapture fortrying toblowup a train. The leg-ironsfrom whichhe had been hungupside down were stillthere, aswere the white oﬃcerswho hadbeaten him. Yet, accordingto an account byMartin Meredith, a historian, he promisedthem a “clean slate” in the newcountry.Soon enough, however, he wasmakinghisown use ofsuch men. He isaccused ofcomplicityin the brutal suppression of theminorityNdebele tribe in the early1980s,when about20,000 people, mostofthemcivilians, were murdered bythe Zimba-bwean army. (He deniesthis.) He had ahand in the Zimbabwean army’sdeploy-mentin the 1990sto the DemocraticRe-publicofCongo, which itplundered. In2008, when MrMugabe and hisrulingZanu-PFpartylosta parliamentaryelec-tion and the ﬁrstround ofthe presidentialone, he orchestrated a lethal wave of vio-lence thatforced the winningchallenger,Morgan Tsvangirai, to withdrawfrom thesecond round. Standingforelection to aparliamentaryseatagainstthe main oppo-sition party, he washimselftwice embar-rassinglydefeated. ButMrMugabe en-sured he would alwaysretain a seniorgovernmentorpartypost.

MrsMugabe’sbid forpowerhashad alonggestation. Backed bya relativelyyoungercoterie ofZanu-PFministersknown asthe “G40” (“Generation 40”),she had alreadymanaged to ejectone rival,Joice Mujuru, from the vice-presidency in2014. In gunningforMrMnangagwa—afewdaysearliershe had described him as“the snake [who] mustbe hiton thehead”—itseemed she wasﬁnallybiddingto replace herhusband. Ata church meet-ingearlierthismonth, itwasreported thatshe declared she wasreadyto succeed him,saying“I sayto MrMugabe youshould...leave me to take overyourpost.” The formersecretary, who had becomeMrMugabe’smistressashisﬁrstwife laydying, did notrealise howdespised she iswithin the rulingZanu-PF party. She rashlypicked ﬁghtswith two ofitssturdiest fac-tions—the securocratsand formerbushﬁghters—in herbid to eliminate rivals forthe presidency. Yetthe biggestfall was notthatofGrace butofMrMugabe himself, aman who wasamongthe lastofAfrica’spresidents-for-life. Hisreign lasted so longthatthe vastmajorityofZimbabweans re-memberno otherruler. And he braggedthatitwould continue “until God sayscome join the otherangels”.Despite hisviciousnessand incompe-tence, he washailed asa hero bymany Af-ricans. Some sawin him a symbol ofresis-tance to the old imperialistpowers. Atmeetingaftermeetingofthe African Un-ion, he could counton a rousingovation, ashe railed againstwhitesand the injusticesthathe imagined rich countries, chiefamongthem Britain, and mysteriousgroupsofhomosexuals, were inﬂicting onZimbabwe. Yetforall hisbluster, blame forthe immiseration ofZimbabwe restschief-lyon hisshoulders. Hisruinouspoliciescaused the economyto collapse, impover-ished hispeople and destroyed theirhealth (see chartson nextpage).Thatneed nothave happened. Forafewyearsafterindependence, Zimbabweprospered. MrMugabe shelved the full-blown Marxisteconomicpolicieshe hadespoused duringthe yearsin prison and inthe guerrilla camps. He allowed the whitefarmers, who had once wanted him dead,to preserve Zimbabwe asthe region’sbreadbasket. There wasan unwritten un-derstanding, he felt, thattheyshould growfood and tobacco butkeep outofpolitics. He wasfarlesstolerantofthe Ndebele,aminorityethnicgroup who continued tobackhislong-standingrival fornationalleadership, Joshua Nkomo. He pretendedthatscattered instancesofbanditryamounted to a massive armed revolt, andordered hisNorth-Korean trained Fifth Bri-gade to crush it. The massacres, torture andrape he inﬂicted on the Ndebele were on alargerscale than anythingthatoccurredduringthe longwaragainstwhite rule. Inthose earlydays, Western governmentsand aid agencies, keen to promote Zimba-bwe asa donor-funded successstory, gen-erallylooked the otherway. Duringthe 1990s, however, corruptionbegan to erode MrMugabe’sauthority. To-wardsthe end ofthatdecade, a group ofag-grieved and landless“warveterans”,manyofthem obviousimpostors, success-fullyagitated forbighandouts, after com-plainingthattheyhad missed outon thepatronage dished outto the bloated elite.Thisblewa hole in the budgetand causedthe IMF to withdrawsupport. Instead ofpullingback, MrMugabespentmore. “Have youeverheard ofacountrythatcollapsed because ofborrow-ing?” he asked, ashe opened the taps onspendingand threatened to grab white-owned farmsand hand them to hissup-porters. Soon after, he called a referendumon a constitutional change to bolster hispoweraspresidentand enable him to con-ﬁscate land withoutpayingcompensation.Atthispoint, in 1999, a trade union-ledmovementrose up, with the help ofsomewhites, includingsome ofthose farmershitherto protected byMrMugabe in returnfortheirquietlyprosperouslife. After hisconstitutional proposal wasvoted down,by55% to 45%, he losthistemper, setting oﬀarecklesscampaign ofland grabs. In re-markablyshortorderone ofAfrica’smostadvanced economiescollapsed. Shortoftaxesand revenuesraised from the exportofcropssuch astobacco, the governmentsoon began to run outofmoney. GideonGono, then governorofthe Reserve BankofZimbabwe, simplyprinted more ofit.“Traditional economicsdo notfullyapplyin thiscountry,” he said. “I am goingtoprintand printand sign the money…be-cause we need money.” Inﬂation reached500 billion percent, accordingto the IMF,or89.7 sextillion percent, accordingto SteveHanke ofJohnsHopkinsUniversity. (Mea-suringhyperinﬂation ishard.)Atthe same time, MrMugabe em-barked on a murderouscampaign to quellthe opposition, led bya courageousifsometimesclumsytrade unionist, MorganTsvangirai, who refused to give up. In 2008he soundlydefeated MrMugabe in the ﬁrstround ofa presidential election, while hispartywon, more narrowly, the generalelection. MrMugabe wasevidentlyshakento the core, perhaps, like so manydictators,because he had come to believe thathispeople loved him. Forﬁve weeks, a cowed electoral com-mission refused to divulge the result, even-tuallymassagingthe ﬁgure ofMrTsvangi-rai’svictorydown to justunder50%, thusrequiringa second round.

Butduringhisown two turns asprime minister(from 2009 to 2011, and 2016to the present) he accomplished little, asthe powerofSunnis, like himself, waned.When Saudi Ogershutdown thisyear, hiscountrymen had little sympathy.

MrVona will have a tough taskconvincingmanyvotersthatthe party’stransforma-tion isreal. Butthere mayindeed be a gap in themarket. Hungarylacksa small-state con-servative party; and manyvotersthink theincessantcampaign ofViktorOrban, theprime minister, againstGeorge Soros, aHungarian-born philanthropistand ﬁnan-cier, isbatty. MrOrban claimsthatMr So-rosplansto swamp Hungarywith mi-grantswith the backingofthe EU. (Howhemightactuallydo thisisunclear, and MrSorosstronglydenieshavinganysuchplan.)

ATHENSAnewpartyforRussian exiles 46EuropeThe EconomistNovember18th2017TO STEPinto the ringwith Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’sbruiserofa president, takescourage and self-belief. Meral Ak-senerhasplentyofboth. Atthe launch ofhernewpolitical partyon October25th, some ofMrsAksener’ssupportersbroke intochantsof“Prime MinisterMeral!” She replied: “No, notprimeminister. President.” Aprominentnationalistand formercabinetminister, she hasnotyetdeclared hercandidacyforelections thatare due to be held in 2019. However, everyone assumesshe will.“Myfriendsreallywantme to run,” she says, referringto col-leaguesfrom hernewlyunveiled, innocuouslynamed Iyi (Good)party. “I mighthave no otherchoice.” Those who challenge MrErdogan tend to pay. The lastto do so,Selahattin Demirtas, jointleaderofthe pro-Kurdish Peoples’DemocraticParty(HDP) and a candidate in the 2014 presidentialelection, wasthrown in prison lastyearon spuriousterrorismcharges. MrsAksenerherselfgota taste ofMrErdogan’smedicinethisyearwhen she campaigned againstproposed amendmentsto the constitution givingthe presidentsweepingnewpowers. Inthe run-up to a referendum on the changes, which passed onlybythe thinnestofmargins, some ofMrsAksener’srallieswerebanned, she wasgiven practicallyno airtime on television, andthe electricitywascutto a hotel where she wasaboutto deliveraspeech. She dared the authoritiesto go even further. “Ifyou’restrongenough, come and arrestme,” she told one rally. MrsAksener, known to hersupportersas“Asena” afteramythical she-wolf, hasshown a rebelliousstreaksince her earli-estdaysin politics. In 1997, when the armypressed the govern-mentto resign, MrsAksenerrefused to go quietly, accusing thegeneralsofstaginga coup. One threatened to impale her “on anoilystake”. Lastyear, asa memberofthe NationalistMovementParty(MHP), she led a mutinyagainstthe group’sancientleader,DevletBahceli, who had endorsed MrErdogan’sconstitution. MrBahceli survived and had MrsAksenerand hersupporters kickedoutofthe party. Withoutcitingplausible evidence, pro-govern-mentnewspapersaccuse heroflinksto the Gulen movement, theIslamistsectbelieved to have led lastyear’sfailed coup.On paperand in person, MrsAksenerseemscapable ofap-pealingto a wide range ofvoters. She isdevoutand prays regular-ly, butdoesnotwearthe headscarf. She isa captivating perform-er, pepperingherspeecheswith wisecracksand jokes. As thename ofherpartysuggests, she isdetermined to be all thingstoall people. (To hone hereverywoman image, she ﬂeweconomyclassto herﬁrstrally.) Whereasthe secularopposition refersto MrErdogan asa dictator, MrsAkseneravoidssuch bluntness so asnotto alienate conservative voters. Instead she fulminatesagainstthe system he hascreated. She promisesto restore the ruleoflaw, on which MrErdogan hastrampled overthe pastyear bylockingup 60,000 civil servants, academicsand soldiers, onlyafraction ofwhom were directlyinvolved in the coup, as well asovera hundred journalistsand a dozen MPs. She saysshe wantsto rightthe wrongscommitted duringthe purges, butwill contin-ue rootingoutGulenistsfrom the bureaucracy. “We need tothwarttheirdreamsofrunningthe state,” she says. She alsopledgesto dismantle the newconstitution, to reform educationand to repairTurkey’srelationship with itsWestern allies. Tosome ofherfans, heartened bypollsthatsuggestthe Good Partycan counton double-digitsupport, she isalreadyTurkey’sbesthope ofreversingthe descentinto absolute rule. The generousviewisthatitisfartoo earlyto tell. The realisticone isthat, asa contenderforthe presidency, MrsAksener facesvirtuallyimpossible odds. To have a shotatdefeatingthe popularMrErdogan, anycandidate mustwin overthe vastmajority ofsecularand nationalistvoters, a share ofdisaﬀected supportersofthe president’sown Justice and Development(AK) party, andmanyofthe country’s15m orso Kurds. MrsAksenermightdo rea-sonablywell with the ﬁrstthree groups, butstandsnext to nochance ofwooingthe last. She wasinteriorministerat the heightofthe army’sscorched-earth campaign againstKurdish insur-gentsin the south-east, and she continuesto surround herselfwith ultranationalists. Liberals, who cringe atthe far-right pag-eantryon displayatMrsAksener’srallies, mightvote forher asthe lesseroftwo evils. Notso the Kurds. Unlike MrErdogan, whooﬀered them some language rightsand launched peace talkswith the PKK rebels(before respondingto a spate ofattacks bylev-ellingtheirneighbourhoodswith artilleryﬁre), MrsAksener hasalwaysbeen a hardliner. There isno “Kurdish problem” in Turkey,she says. “To anyone who saystheywantgroup rightsbecausetheyare diﬀerent,” she declares, “I openlysayno.” Teeth orno teeth?MrsAksener’sbestchance ofmakinga diﬀerence will be at theparliamentaryelection, which will be held atthe same time asthe presidential one. Byeatinginto AK’ssupport, she and theGoodscould deprive MrErdogan ofhismajority. Some criticshave argued thatthiscountsforlittle, since the newconstitutionisexpected to renderparliamenttoothless. Butno one knows ex-actlyhowthe newsystem will work. An opposition-dominatedparliamentcould actassomethingofa brake on the president. The biggerissue iswhetherMrErdogan, who relishespowerasmuch ashe fearsrelinquishingit, will allowa free election totake place. The referendum on the newconstitution washeld in aclimate ofrepression and censorship, and prompted claims ofex-tensive vote-rigging. The state ofemergency, which allows MrEr-dogan to rule bydecree, lookssetto lastindeﬁnitely. Some ofMrsAksener’sassociatesacknowledge the riskofnewsmearcam-paignsand even arrestsasthe election drawscloser. She saysthatwould betrayweakness. “Tayyip Erdogan won’tletanyone saythathe wasscared ofa woman,” she says. Butnotbeingafraid ofMrErdogan mightbe MrsAksener’sbiggestdraw. 7She-wolfvsultanDoes Meral Aksenerhave a chance againstTurkey’s president?

Butanotherisexcessive rigidity and apremature closingdown ofoptions. Thishasoften made the talksbetween DavidDavis, the Brexitsecretary, and Michel Bar-nier, the EU’schiefBrexitnegotiator, need-lesslyconfrontational.The EU27 are byno meansblameless inthis. PretendingthatBrexitwasa problemforBritain alone and thattheyhad morepressingmattersto attend to hasnothelped. Insistingthatthe talkscannotmove to a second phase until the divorceterms, includinga large exitbill for Britain,are settled wasalwayslikelyto lead todeadlock. Failure to progressto the secondphase in Decemberwould be a blowto theEUaswell asto Britain.Even so, Britain isthe biggerculprit.Since the election in June, Theresa May’smandingparliamentaryapproval forthetermsofBrexit, MrDavisoﬀered a pre-emptive concession bypromisinganotherbill, mostlikelynextautumn, to give eﬀectto whateverdeal the governmenteventu-allynegotiatesin Brussels.Buthe undid thisapparentlyemollientgesture in two ways. The ﬁrstwasto an-nounce hisown amendment, namingMarch 29th 2019, two yearsafterthe invo-cation ofArticle 50, asBrexitday. The sec-ond wasto insistthat, were Parliament sig-niﬁcantlyto amend oreven to reject thebill on the deal, the onlyoption left, giventhe time constraints, would be to leave theEUwith no deal atall.There isno reason whyMPsshould bebrowbeaten into acceptingthis.

MrsMayhasalreadyacceptedthatBritain should stayin both during anytransitional period.Asforrejectingthe deal altogether,there iscertainlya riskthat, in accordancewith the two-yeardeadline ﬁxed byArticle50, thiscould lead to Brexitwithout anydeal. Butitwould nothave to. AsJohn Kerr,aformerBritish diplomatcloselyinvolvedin draftingArticle 50, pointed outata re-centeventhosted byOpen Britain, a pro-European lobbygroup, itallowsthe two-yeardeadline to be extended byunani-mousagreement.

Afterthe election asensible governmentwould have conced-ed thatitslossofa Commonsmajoritymeantithad to paymore attention to MPsand granta greaterrole to Parliament. Amain motive forBrexitwas, afterall, to re-patriate sovereigntyfrom Brusselsto West-minster. Yetthe governmenthassought tosabotage all parliamentaryattemptstohave more sayoverthe termsofexit.

MostEUlawyersagree, al-though some saythe article isunclear. Ulti-matelyonlythe ECJcan decide on the mat-ter. ButLord Kerrnoted thatmanyEUleadershave gone outoftheirwayto saythatBritain could still change itsmind.Chuka Umunna, a pro-European LabourMP, said voterswho backed Brexitin thereferendum were, in eﬀect, promised ashinynewcarwith all the trimmings; ifwhatison oﬀernextyearisjustan oldbanger, theyshould notbe made to buy it.Anysuggestion thatBrexitmightnothappen is, ofcourse, a red ragto Brexiteers.Thisweekthe DailyTelegraphsplashed un-derthe headline “The Brexitmutineers”photosof15 ToryMPswho had merelyex-pressed theiropposition to writingBrexitdayinto the withdrawal bill. Asithappens,there islittle sign thatpublicopinion hasaltered since the referendum. Butthatcould change. The economyhasslowed,even asithaspicked up in the restof Eu-rope. Pollssuggestmostvotersdo not ex-pectthe governmentto geta good Brexitdeal. And thisweekthere were claims ofRussian involvementin the referendum,through massfake Twitteraccounts.

The House ofCommonsisone ofthe oldestrepresenta-tive institutionson Earth. The country’slastviolentrevolutionwasin the middle ofthe 17th century. With politiciansasdiﬀerentasClementAttlee and MargaretThatcherdenouncingthem as“adevice fordictatorsand demagogues”, Britain avoided nation-wide referendumsuntil 1975 and hasonlyused them three times.The British erectstatuesto statesmen and women in Parliamentratherthan to “the people”.YetBritish politicsiscurrentlybeingreshaped bypopulism.The essence ofpopulism isthe beliefthatsocietycan be dividedinto two antagonisticclasses—the people and the powerful. Thepeople are presumed to have a single will. The powerful are pre-sumed to be deviousand corrupt: determined to feathertheirown nestsand adeptatusingintermediaryinstitutions(courts,media companies, political parties) to frustrate the people. Youcan see evidence ofthiseverywhere in British politics.The Brexiteers’ clinchingargumentisalwaysthe same: “The peo-ple have spoken.” The DailyMailhasbranded the judgesoftheHigh Courtas“enemiesofthe people” and urged Theresa Mayto“crush the saboteurs”. On November15th the DailyTelegraphtried to out-Mailthe Mail byprintingphotographsofthe 15 ToryMPswho had indicated thattheywould vote againstMrsMay’sattemptto enshrine the date thatBritain leavesthe European Un-ion into lawand brandingthem “the Brexitmutineers”.Farfrom ﬁghtingoﬀthe virusofpopulism, Britain is becomingitsmostsurprisingvictim. British politiciansmaylook civilisedcompared with, say, Hungary’sViktorOrban orAmerica’sDo-nald Trump. ButMrOrban rulesa countrythathasbeen scarredbycommunism and MrTrump ishedged in bychecksand bal-ancesgalore. Americanswill be rid ofMrTrump by2021or2025.The Brexitreferendum will continue to shape British politics fordecadesto come.Britain hassuccumbed to the populistvirusbecause it decid-ed to applythe mostpowerful tool in the populisttoolbox—thereferendum—to the mostprofound question in British politicaleconomy—itsrelationship with itsmain political and economicpartner. The subsequentdebate pitted Britain’sentire rulingclass,from the leadersofthe three main political partiesto the headsofmultinational companies, againsta ragbagarmyofrebels, trou-blemakersand mavericks. ByvotingLeave, the British not onlyelected to change theirrelationship with the European Union butalso to reordertheirpolitical system.The mostvisible resultofthisreorderingisthe chaos ofdailypolitics. Since the referendum two ofBritain’sthree main partieshave losttheirleaders, Theresa Mayhasfoughta botched elec-tion, the cabinethasbeen paralysed byinﬁghtingand JeremyCorbyn, Labour’shard-leftleader, hasbecome prime-minister-in-waiting. The lessvisible resultisa constitutional revolution. Be-fore the referendum, Parliamentwassovereign (though, as Brexi-teersrightlypointed out, the EU keptencroachingon thatsover-eignty). Now, forthe ﬁrsttime in Britain’slongparliamentaryhistory, mostMPsfeel obliged to vote fora policythatthey op-pose—in otherwords, to give in to a populistrevolution. Three-quartersofMPsvoted forRemain. Onlytwo parties, with a com-bined total ofnine MPs—the UK Independence Partywith oneand the DemocraticUnionistswith eight—supported Brexit. Still,the chancesofParliamentscupperingthe withdrawal are small.Whydid a traditionallycautiouspeople decide to take such aradical step? RoyJenkins, a formercabinetminister, once pro-nounced thatthe British voted to stayin the European Communi-ty(asitthen was) because they“tookthe advice ofpeople theywere used to following”. David Cameron, the unwittingFaust ofBritain’spopulistrevolution, chose to call the referendum atatime ofmaximum disillusionmentwith those “people theywereused to following”. Votersfelttheyhad little in common with pol-iticianswho seemed to come with identikitbackgrounds(a poshuniversityand a spell in a think-tank) and identikitviews (cosmo-politan liberalism).And theyfeltthatpoliticianshad messed upthe governmentofthe country. Both Labourand the Tories hadclaimed to knowhowto harnessglobalisation forthe commongood. Butthe ﬁnancial crisisof2008 had led to the deepestreces-sion fordecades, with real wagesfallingand productivitygrowthstalling. ManyBritonsused the referendum asan excuse to deliv-era one-ﬁngered salute to theirsupposed betters.Here to stayThe strongestjustiﬁcation ofthe referendum isthatit wasa one-oﬀvote to settle the vexed constitutional question of Britain’sre-lationship with the EU: once Britain hasreasserted itsindepen-dence, the sovereigntyofParliamentwill be restored and popu-lism contained. Thisiswishful thinking. IfBritain withdrawsfrom the EU,the economicshockwill be profound. Those whowill suﬀermostwill be the verypeople who voted forBrexit asacryofdeﬁance (the depreciation ofsterlingsince the referendumhasalreadydisproportionatelyhitthe lowest-paid, bypushingup the price offood and fuel). Meanwhile, ifParliament some-howscuppersthe process, there could be riotsin the streets.The biggestbeneﬁciaryofthisturmoil isMrCorbyn. He hasal-waysbeen a populist. Along-standingadmirerofﬁrebrands suchasFidel Castro and Hugo Chávez, he believesthatParliament isonlyone arena forthe people’sstruggle againstthe powerful. Hissupportershave alreadytoyed with de-selectingMPswho do nottoe the hard-leftpartyline and with engagingin direct action tobringdown MrsMay’sgovernment. Theyhave also builta perso-nalitycultaround MrCorbyn asthe true voice ofthe people in acorruptpolitical world.

Mostsuﬀeronlya minorgenital anomaly, butdoctorswill struggle to classifya fewasmale orfe-male. The genitalia ofsome such “inter-sex” people are a combination ofmale andfemale. Some XXpeople produce unusu-allyhigh levelsofandrogens(male hor-mones) in the womb, and some XYonesdo notrespond to androgensin the usualway. Theymaybe born with bodiesthatare more typical ofXYorXXpeople, re-spectively. Theirbirth registrations mayclash with theirgenes. Lostin classiﬁcationUntil recentlyintersexchildren usually re-ceived the surgerydoctorsthoughtmostlikelyto produce a bodytypical forone sexorthe other. Nowmanythinkdoctorsshould waituntil children can decide whatto do themselves. In 2013 the UN specialrapporteuron torture condemned gender-normalisation surgeryforchildren. Eric Vi-lain, a medical geneticistin Washington,DC, isleadinga longitudinal study on thetreatmentofintersexchildren. “Rightnow,we’re exploringa lotofdiagnoses, withoutthe appropriate research,” he says. Intersexpeople are unusuallylikely toswitch genderidentityatsome point, per-hapsbecause those identitiesare less sta-ble ortheywere misclassiﬁed in child-hood. Theirexistence, and theirvaryinggenderexpressions, showthatbiologicalsexisneithercleanlybinarynorinsepara-ble from genderidentity. Butmostgender-dysphoricpeople have no known anoma-lyofhormones, physique orbrain struc-ture. Some neuroscientiststhinkthey havefound atypicalitiesin such people’sbrains;othersare unconvinced. Lackingan observable cause, trans peo-ple can ﬁnd ithard to convince others oftheirfeltidentities. Somethingso inward ishard to demonstrate. Itisalso hard to ex-plain. Danielle Castro, who worksattheCentre ofExcellence forTransgenderHealth in San Francisco, isa transwoman.Asked whyshe transitioned from the maleidentityon herbirth certiﬁcate, she search-esforwords: “myown innate sense ofself…I feel more comfortable; thisiswho Iam.” Itisharderto explain transgenderidentitiesto “cisgender” people (“cis” istheLatin preﬁxfor“on thisside of”) than toconvince heterosexual people ofthe reali-tyofhomosexual desire, she says. “It’seas-ierto acceptthat‘love islove’.”Gender-dysphoricadultsmaybe of-fered genderreassignment. The estab-lished protocol isto take cross-sexhor-monesand live in the targetidentity forayearortwo. Ifpsychiatristsagree, they maythen be oﬀered the delicate surgerywhere-bygenitalsare reshaped. Manytranspeo-ple do only“top” surgery—breastreductionorenlargement. “Some ofthe mosthelpfulsurgeriesare chestand facial because thatiswhatpeople see,” saysColtKeo-Meier, apsychologist(and transman). Doctorsnaturallyworrythata patientmayregretsuch life-alteringtreatment. Notall the changeswroughtbycross-sexhor-monesare reversible, and genital surgerymaycause sterility. Conversely, some transpeople ﬁnd itfrustratingto have to con-vince doctorsto permitthem to transition.Thismayfeel like panderingto stereo-types. Sam Blanckensee, a 23-year-old Irishtransman, sayshe resented havingto acthyper-masculine to getsurgery. After hav-ingtop surgeryand no longerneeding toconvince anyone, he feelscloserto non-bi-nary. “In the eyesofmydoctorsI wouldhave been seen asbinary. I stuckwith thatidea because itwaseasierto getthe rightmedicinesand procedures.”And yettranspeople themselvescanalso fall backon genderstereotypes—pro-vokingfuriousrowswith feminists. InMarch Jenni Murray, the hostofBBC Radio4’s“Women’sHour”, wrote ofinterview-ingtwo transwomen: India Willoughby, atelevision presenter, and Carol Stone, anAnglican vicar. MsWilloughbyendorsedworkplacesrequiringwomen to wearmakeup, and said unshaven legson wom-en were “dirty”. The RevStone said hermain concern aftertransitioningwaswhatto wearto meetparishioners. “‘Feelinglike’ a woman seemsto implyfeelinglike wearingmascara, heels, hair ex-tensionsand stockings,” wrote Lionel Shri-ver, a novelist(who haswritten forthisnewspaper), lastyearin an essaytitled“Gender—Good forNothing” in Prospect, aBritish magazine. “The version offeminini-tyoﬀered up byCaitlyn Jennerisforeign tome—exaggeratedlycoiﬀed, buﬀed and cor-seted.” That“version offemininity” rilesmanyfeminists. Simone de Beauvoir’sfamousremarkthat“a woman isnotborn,butmade” wasintended asa criticism ofthe arduousfeminine ideal thatdeformedwomen’slives, notasa promise that attain-ingthatideal conferred womanhood.Buta woman who takessuch a linenowrisksbeingcalled a TERF, asMsMur-rayand MsShriverhave been. Indeed, anyexploration oftransgenderidentities canbe risky(astranspeople knowbetter thananyone). Rebecca Tuvel, a philosopher atRhodesCollege in Memphis, waspilloriedforherarticle, “In Defence ofTransracial-ism”, published in March. Itargued from aviewpointsympatheticto transgenderidentitiesthatRachel Dolezal, a whitewoman who described herselfasblack,should be accepted in herchosen racialidentity. More than a hundred academicscalled foritsretraction, sayingthat itcaused “harm” to transpeople, forexam-ple by“dead-naming” a transwoman, thatis, referringto herbyherformermalename. Theyomitted thatthe transwomanin question wasMsJenner, who often talksaboutlife asBruce.Attemptsto make language more inclu-sive oftranspeople mean thatin somequartersthe verywords“man” and “wom-an” are fallingoutofuse. Some sexual-health clinicsnowtalkabout“people withprostates”, “people with vaginas” and soon. An article in the Tab, a studentmaga-zine, aboutstressand the menstrual cycleavoided the words“female” and “wom-en”, notingthatovera third of“studentswith uteruses” atCambridge had missedperiods. Such redeﬁnitionscan be merely awayofsignallingpolitical virtue. And theycause more trouble forwomen than formen, since itiswomen who more oftenneed to organise and speakcollectively, forexample aboutmaternal and contracep-tive services, discrimination and harass-ment, and sexual violence.Rowsin America overwhich lavatoriestranspeople should use, and whethertranswomen should be allowed intowomen-onlyevents, have aligned somefeministswith the conservativesthey nor-mallyoppose in the culture wars.

Butfortranswomen exclusionfrom the group qualiﬁed to entersuchspacesstrikesattheirself-conception.Acrucial conceptforthose who workwith transpeople, saysMsCastro, is “gen-der-identitythreat”—an attackon a transperson’sidentity. Asan example, she de-scribesprojectsshe workson to reduce thenumberoftranswomen who are HIV-pos-itive. Theymayengage in riskysexto shoreup theirsense offemaleness, she says, inresponse to remarksorsituationsthatthreaten thatsense, forexample beingtreated in anti-HIV programmesdesignedforgaymen—orexcluded from women-onlyspaces. CuttingHIV transmission re-quires“genderaﬃrmation”—reinforcingtheiridentitiesin constructive ways, forex-ample with supportgroupsorcounselling. In the earlydaysgender-reassignmentclinicssawmore maleswishingto changesexthan females. Manypeople thoughtthisreﬂected a psychological diﬀerence be-tween the sexes. The conventional wis-dom nowisthatthe reason wassocial. Par-entswere more bothered by“sissy” sonsthan “tomboy” daughters. And men whodressed and acted like women faced mock-ery, more so than the otherwayround.In recentyearsthe balance hasshiftedhugely. The British gender-dysphoria ser-vice nowseesfourtimesasmanygirls whoare suﬀeringasboys. Thismaybe becauseconstraintson male behaviourhave loos-ened. Itmayalso be because havinga fe-male bodyhasbecome more onerousforchildren. Some girlsseem unable to ﬁnd aplace forthemselvesin a sea ofsparklypinkprincessdresses, and then, after pu-berty, in a hypersexualised pop culture. “Ifthe mind cannotbe changed to ﬁtthe body, then perhapswe should considerchangingthe bodyto ﬁtthe mind,” ran thepressnotice when America’sﬁrstgender-reassignmentclinic, atJohnsHopkins Hos-pital in Baltimore, opened in 1965. Thatwording, which seemed so progressive atthe time, would nowbe regarded bysomeactivistsasstartingfrom a false premise.The “gender-aﬃrmative” approach takeslastinggenderdysphoria to signal a cross-genderidentitythatneedsno explanation.The JohnsHopkinsclinic’simplication—thatan attemptto change the mind shouldprecede one to change the body—isseen asakin to discredited “conversion therapies”to turn gaypeople straight.In 2015 Kenneth Zucker, a Canadianpaediatrician specialisingin genderdys-phoria, wassacked and hisclinicshut afteracampaign byactivists. Hisstarting pointhad been to tryto help gender-dysphoricchildren become more comfortable withtheirbiological sex, and to waitand see iftheychanged theirminds. In a BBC docu-mentarylastyear, he drewan analogy: “Afour-year-old mightsaythathe’sa dog—doyougo outand buydogfood?”The comparison caused outrage. But DrZuckerwasmakingan importantpoint:gender-dysphoricchildren are notall setfortransgenderadulthood. In the late1960sand early1970sRichard Green, a psy-chiatristand sexologistthen atUCLA, stud-ied boyswith markedlyfeminine identi-ties. Some four-ﬁfthsofthose followed toadulthood matured into gayorbisexualmen. Onlyone wastransgender. Studies inCanada and the Netherlandshave sincefound ratesof12-39% forpersistence oftransgenderidentityinto adulthood. Thisispuzzling: genderidentity isdis-tinctfrom sexual orientation. Mostgaypeople neverdoubttheirgenderidentities.Plentyoftranspeople are homosexual;ProfessorGreen estimatesthata third ofthe post-surgerytranswomen he sawbe-tween 1995 and 2007 while workingatCharingCrossHospital in London, whichhad the world’slargesttransgendertreat-mentprogramme atthe time, were attract-ed to women. Bruce Jennerwasheterosex-ual; in VanityFairCaitlyn said she didn’tyetknowwhere hersexual interestslayand that“ifyouhave a listoften reasons totransition, sexwould be numberten.” And yetmuch evidence suggeststhatgenderdysphoria dependspartlyon asociety’sattitudes, notonlytowardsgen-dernonconformitybuttowardshomosex-uality. The penaltyformale homosexual-ityin Iran isdeath, forexample, but theayatollahsbelieve thata person can be“trapped” in the wrongbody. GayIranianmen are pressed to acceptcross-sexhor-monesand gender-reassignmentsurgery.Though some ﬂee the countryto avoidchangingsex, othersﬁnd doingso allowsthem to live more comfortably.The majorityviewamongthose whosee them in clinical settingsisthat childrenwith settled genderdysphoria should begiven drugsthatdelaypuberty, so theyhave more time to decide whatto do be-fore theirbodiesgrowinto whatmaybethe wrongadultform. “We can’tidentifywith certaintywhich caseswill persist,”saysPollyCarmichael, the directorof Brit-ain’snational gender-identityservice. “Sowe have to pace treatmentcarefully.” Butlittle isknown yetaboutthe life courses ofchildren who startsuch “pubertyblock-ers”. Delayingpubertymaybe harmful, ifmanychildren who saythey“feel like” theopposite sexare expressingwhatwill,post-puberty, settle into an unconven-tional genderidentityorsame-sexattrac-tion. Itmayshort-circuitthe processwherebysome gender-identityissueswould naturallyhave been resolved. All thisputsdoctorsin a quandary.Transitioningearliermeansbetterphysicalresults. Waitingmeansneedlessdistressforchildren who will notchange theirminds. Butwhataboutthe others? Willsome ofthose whose identityswitcheshave been reported in television showsand magazinesend up feelingregret? Willtheybe able to ﬁnd a wayback? And someofthose who do notregrettransitioningmightalso have been contenthad they notdone so, in which case theywill, on bal-ance, have been harmed. ProfessorGreencites“the medical consequences, the hor-mones, the riskofimperfectsurgeryandperhapsunwanted infertility.” Asfortheprobabilitythatsome would otherwisehave grown up cisgenderand gay, he says:“I’ve been seeingtranssexualsfor50 years.Ican tell youthatbeinga gayman or lesbi-an woman isone hell ofa loteasier.” Gender-mendingMostpeople are comfortable with theirgenderidentities, perhapswithouthavinganystrongsense ofbeingmale orfemale.MsShriverwrites: “I have no idea whatit‘feelslike’ to be a woman—and I am one.”Astraditional and legal constraintsonmen’sand women’sbehaviourloosen,thatgroup maygrowand, with luck, thenumberofchildren who feel stiﬂed bytheirgenderroleswill fall.

Butthe formerscrap-metal dealer,whose home wasonce owned bythe Roth-schild family, ismuch lessblackand white.On hisstartlingpurchase thisyearof 21% ofthe sharesofAnglo American, one oftheworld’sbest-known mininggroups, he issphinx-like. The onlythingthatisclear ishisambition to be one ofthe world’sbig-gestminingmoguls. Anglo American ispartofthatvision. MrAgarwal, 63, hasmade mostofhisfortune bettingon India—often with bor-rowed money. Hissalespitch issimple. In-dia, like China, isa countrywith gallopingdemand forrawmaterials. Unlike China,itsmetalsconsumption perperson isstillasmuch as80% belowthe global average.Hissprawlingarrayofﬁrms, which are list-ed asVedanta Limited and Hindustan Zincin India and Vedanta Resourcesin London,are mainlya playon Indian growth and ur-banisation; theymake mostmoneysellingzincwithin India to turn into galvanisedsteel. MrAgarwal pursuesgrowth ambi-tiously. He speaksofundisclosed plans toinvesta further$8bn overthe nextseveralyears, mostlyto produce more oil, gas, zinc,aluminium and copperwithin India.Often histransactions, such asthe$14.5bn acquisition ofCairn India, thecountry’slargestprivate oil and gas com-pany, are complex, and demonstrate littleregard forminorityshareholders. But heshowsmuch more consideration forthedisadvantaged: he haspledged three-quar-tersofhiswealth, estimated byForbesat$3.2bn, to charity. Ofthe world’sbiggestminingcompa-nies, fewcome closerto Vedanta forcom-plexitythan Anglo American, whose ori-ginsare in South Africa. Asitstruggledunderheavydebtduringthe commoditiesslump in 2015-16, MrAgarwal proposed tothe London-listed companya mergerwithHindustan Zinc, which isone oftheworld’slowest-costzincminers. Anglo rejected the idea, butMrAgarwalbided histime. He boughtthe Anglo sharesin two stageswith the proceedsofa bond.Afterthree yearshe can eitherredeem thebond with cash and keep the shares, or re-payitwith the sharesthemselves. He de-scribesthiscomplextransaction asa “pas-sive investment”. Otherssee itaspassiveaggression. The second stage ofthe acquisi-tion wastimed an hourbefore Anglolaunched itscentenarycelebrationsinSouth Africa in September. Itlefta bittertaste in some mouths. Since then, hisinterventionshave beenpuzzling. Until recently, investorshad beenpushingAnglo to streamline itsoperationsaround core mineralssuch asdiamonds,copperand platinum, while sellingSouthAfrican iron-ore and coal assets. But MrAgarwal hasargued againstthat. “I keep re-mindingthem thatthiscompanyisSouthAfrican and theyshould notforgetthat,”he says. When asked why, he isvague, in-sistingonlythat“origin isveryimportant”. Despite a controversial miningcharterin South Africa, which domesticﬁrms dis-like, MrAgarwal isbullish on the country’sminingindustry. BesideshisAnglo stake,he isinvesting$1bn in one ofhiszincmines, Gamsberg, in the Northern Cape,which will startproducingnextyear. Itused to be owned byAnglo.Some see broaderpolitical orstrategicinterestsatplaybetween India and SouthAfrica, notingthatMrAgarwal hastrav-elled to South Africa with Narendra Modi,India’sprime minister. Buthe denies this,and dismissesthe notion thatIndia is try-ingto replicate China’sscramble forre-sourcesin Africa. He saysMrModi is sim-ply“sentimentallyattached” to SouthAfrica because ofthe legacyofMahatmaGandhi.He deniesthathe hasanyintention inthe shortrun ofresurrectinga merger withAnglo—though he hasto be circumspect toavoid beingrequired to launch a formaltakeoverattempt. Some argue thata dealwould be hard to pull oﬀanyway, becauseAnglo’sshareholderswould notwantVe-danta’sshares. Butfewdoubtsome of An-glo’sassetsare appealingto MrAgarwal. IfAnglo continuesto underperform itspeers, global minerswill seekto swoop onitsbestassets. With a ringside seat on theshare register, MrAgarwal would be well-placed to join the fray. 7MiningThe sphinxofzincAn Indian tycoon’s raid on AngloAmerican is a riddle Agarwal contemplates his next move56BusinessThe EconomistNovember18th2017The EconomistNovember18th2017 Business57Allergan and the MohawksApatentploy“BRAZEN” and “absurd”: Allergancertainlydrewa reaction fromAmerican lawmakerswhen ittransferreditspatentsforRestasis, a dry-eye drug, tothe SaintRegisMohawkTribe in Septem-ber.

These included mea-suresto force carriersto use theirexistingcapacitybetter, such asraisingthe “use itorlose it” level from 80% to 85%. Butthechangeswere puton ice in 2012, partlydueto lobbyingbyairlines. Othercountriesare tryingmore radicalsolutions. In 2008 America’saviation regu-latorproposed auctioningslotsatNewYork’sairports. Thiswould reduce the rentairlinesgain from theirslots’ scarcityvalue.Butthe idea wasdropped afterairlineschallenged itin court. LastyearChina ex-perimented with a slotauction atGuang-zhouand a slotlotteryatShanghai.Sky’s limitIATA claimsthatauctionsdo nothelp newentrants, which maynotbe able to aﬀordbigupfrontslotfees. Abetteridea, says MsAdler, iscongestion pricingforrunways—where airlinesare charged more to useslotsatbusytimes. London’sGatwickair-port, which hasmade stepsin thisdirec-tion, hasseen 50% growth in passengerssince 2010, asthe changeshave encouragedairlinesto make fulleruse oftheirslots andto release underused onesto newentrants.Unlike auctions, no upfrontfeesare pay-able, reducingbarriersto entry.One idea isto putthe moneyraisedfrom congestion pricingin a central pot,outside the control ofairports, to fund im-provementsin aviation infrastructure.Withoutexpansion beyond thatalreadyplanned, 19 ofEurope’sbiggestairportswill by2035 be ascongested asHeathrowtoday, which operatesatfull capacity, saysOlivierJankovecofACI Europe, a tradegroup.

Along-standingdilemma iswhetheritmakessense to combine“pipe” companiesthatconnectcustomersbymobile orﬁxedlines, and “content” ﬁrmsthatmake and bundle packagesofTVshowsand web content. Mostﬁrmshave been inconsistent andmade several U-turnsoverthe years, ﬂittingbetween “vertical”integration (owningpipesand content) and horizontal scale (hav-inga high marketshare in eitherone orthe other).Todaythere isdisorderunderheaven again, sparked by therise ofNetﬂixand Amazon Prime, and the media ambitions ofothertech ﬁrmssuch asApple. No one issure howto react. RupertMurdoch tried to bulkup in the traditional contentbusiness in2014, bybiddingforTime Warner, buthasrecentlybeen in talkstoexititbysellinghisﬁrm, 21stCenturyFox, to WaltDisney.

Overthe pastthree yearssuch price riseshave boosted proﬁtsbyabout14%—withoutthem Time Warnerwould be almoststagnant. Thisisthe bubblingearnings streamthatNetﬂixand Silicon Valleyﬁrmsare keen to divert.Second, the numbersdo notadd up. Atthe oﬀerprice of$108pershare, AT&Twill make a lowlyreturn on capital of5.5% on thedeal. Ifithitsitscost-cuttingtargets, thiswill rise to about6%. Evenifyouthinkthe newﬁrm will make the same advertising proﬁtspercustomerasFacebook, the return would still be a subpar 8%. AT&Tcould boostreturnsbyusingitsmuscle in the pipes busi-nessto force clientsto buyTime Warner’scontentratherthan thatofrivals. IfTime Warner’smarketshare rose from 20% to 35%, thedeal’sreturn would rise to a decent11%. Butthisapproach wouldrun up againstthe third problem: regulation. Even ifthe deal isal-lowed, regulatorswould demand thatAT&Tran Time Warnerwithoutdiscriminatingagainstotherpipe orcontentﬁrms. Thiswould make itharderforAT&Tto extractbeneﬁtsthatother ﬁrmscould not. Avertical deal between Comcastand NBCUniversal,in 2011, had similarconditions.Curb yourenthusiasmPerhapsAT&Tthinksthatitcan outwitregulatorsbyagreeing tosuch termsand then dancingaround them once the deal is com-pleted.

Ifener-gypricesare excluded from the calcula-tion, inﬂation waseven weaker. Whyhasinﬂation lagged behind—anddoesitmatter? One reason isthatwageshave notrisen asfastasexpected. The payofworkersin cyclical, insecure positions,such asyakitori waiters, hasrisen fairlyquickly. Butthe same isnottrue ofJapan’s“core” workers, who accountforthe bulkofthe country’swage income.

Itwashard foranyactivemanagerto keep gainingmarketshare;eventually, theirperformance tooka hit.Butpassive managersbeneﬁtfrom econo-miesofscale. The more fundstheyman-age, the lowertheirfeescan become, andthe more attractive the product.Since passive managerslike BlackRockand Vanguard own the sharesofeverycompanyin an industry, the fearis thattheymightplaya role reminiscentof themonopoly“trusts” ofthe late 19th century.Studieshave argued thatthe concentratedownership ofsharesisassociated withhigherfaresin the airline industry andfeesin the bankingsector.These criticismscannotsurelyboth betrue. Theyrequire indexfundssimulta-neouslyto be uncritical sheep-like inves-torsand ruthlesstop-hatted capitalists de-voted to gougingconsumers. Furthermore,passive investors, in the form ofmutualfundsand exchange-traded funds, ownonly12.4% ofthe American equitymarket.Itseemsremarkable thattheycan havesuch a bigimpacton the corporate sectorwith such a small stake. Itisworth examiningthe criticisms indetail. The Marxistcriticism implicitly as-sumesthatthe investmentcommunityisdivided into two—passive investorsandactive managersdevoted to combatingcor-porate excessand ferretingoutexcitingnewbets.

To go into force, membersmakingup atleast85% oftheircombinedGDPhad to ratifyit. Three daysinto hispresidency, Donald Trump announcedthatAmerica wasout. With 60% ofmem-bers’ GDPgone, thatdeal wasdoomed. Buton November11th, anotherbegan torise in itsplace, crowned with a tongue-twistingnewname: the Comprehensiveand Progressive Agreementforthe Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership (CPTPP). Ministersfromits11membersissued a jointstatementsay-ingthattheyhad agreed on itscore ele-ments, and thatitdemonstrated their “ﬁrmcommitmentto open markets”. The politi-cal symbolism waspowerful. AsAmericaretreats, otherswill lead instead.The CPTPPisstill farfrom ﬁnished,however. Thisinconvenienttruth isunsur-prising. Resuscitatingthe deal without itsbiggestmemberwasalwaysgoingto behard. WithoutAmerica, uncomfortableconcessionsmade in the old TPPcan seemlessworthwhile. Butanyattemptata fullrenegotiation risked the entire deal unrav-elling. Ifcountriesused the opportunity tograb newconcessionsin theirpetareas,otherscould make counterclaimsand talkscould descend into a protectionistmess.The fewunresolved areasreﬂectthesechallenges. Malaysia wantsmore time toadjustto rulesgoverningitsstate-ownedenterprises. Brunei wantsa more lenientapproach to itscoal industry. And Vietnam,which stood to gain mostfrom extra accessto the American clothingmarket, wantsmore time before itcould face sanctions forviolatingthe pact’slabourlaws.

Fortheirpart, Japanese negotiatorswere keen to create an incentive forAmeri-ca to join the CPTPPin the future. Some ofthe original rulescould beneﬁtAmericaeven outside the pact, bluntingitsincen-tive to rejoin. Butditchingtoo many ofthem mightcause the beneﬁtsofthe origi-nal to be lost. Aside from the areasstill underdiscus-sion, the ministerial statementlisted 20carve-outsfrom the original pact. Rulesthatgave special treatmentto express ship-ments, a sop to American companieslikeDHLand Federal Express, will be suspend-ed.

Thanks tomandatory, tax-deductible saving, theDutch have stored up a collective pensionpotofnearly€1.4trn ($1.6trn), roughlydou-ble GDP. Mercer, a consultancy, marks thecountryassecond onlyto Denmarkin aglobal rankingofschemes. YetDutch people’sfaith in theirpen-sionshassunkaslowastheirtrustin banksand insurers. In March a political party foroldervoters, 50+, won fourseatsin theDutch parliament, largelythanksto its pro-mise to “stop the pension raid”. ABP’sownmembersmarkitatjust5.9 outof10. The discontentstemsfrom unmetex-pectations. MarcHeemskerk, from Mercer,saysthat, in members’ eyes, fundslike ABPoverpromised and now“face a gigantictrustcrisis”.

One expla-nation is that industries are getting lesscompetitive. Work by The Economistfound that two-thirds of American in-dustries were more concentrated in thehands of a few ﬁrms in 2012 than in 1997.Research by AXAInvestment ManagersRosenberg Equities into the languageused in American annual reports points inthe same direction. Sherlock Holmesfamously talked of the signiﬁcance of thedog that did not bark in the night. It maybe similarly important that companiesrefer to rivals much less than they did;usage of the word “competition” in annu-al reports has declined by three-quarterssince the turn of the century. Business isless cut-throat than it used to be.CompetitionINTHE ﬁrstquarterof2018 thousandsofbankswill looka little lessproﬁtable. Anewinternational accountingstandard,IFRS9, will oblige lendersin more than 120countries, includingthe European Union’smembers, to increase provisionsforcreditlosses. In America, which hasitsown stan-dard-setter, IFRS9 will notbe applied—butby2019 banksthere will also have to fol-lowa slightlydiﬀerentregime.The newrule hasitsrootsin the ﬁnan-cial crisisof2007-08, in the wake ofwhichthe leadersofthe G20 countriesdeclaredthataccountingstandardsneeded an over-haul. Amongtheirothershortcomings,bankshad done too little, too late, to recog-nise losseson wobblyassets. Underexist-ingstandardstheymake provisionsonlywhen lossesare incurred, even ifthey seetrouble coming. IFRS9, which comesintoforce on January1st, obligesthem to pro-vide forexpected lossesinstead.UnderIFRS9 bankloansare classiﬁedin one ofthree “stages”. When a loan ismade—stage one—banksmustmake a pro-vision equivalentto the expected loss on itoverthe next12 months, howeversmall.There itstaysunlessthingschange: if creditriskincreasesbutthe loan isstill good (sup-pose, when a bankhaslentmoneyto ahouse-builder, thatthe propertymarkettakesa tumble), itshiftsto stage two. Thebankmustincrease the provision, to the ex-pected lossoverthe life ofthe loan; itspro-ﬁtstake a one-oﬀhit. Ifthe loan goes bad, itpassesto stage three. The provision is thesame asin stage two, butfrom then on thebankbookslessinterestrevenue, in pro-portion to the expected losson the loan. (Inthe American rule, banksmustrecogniselifetime expected lossesfrom the oﬀ.)In theory, the change makessense. Theold rule ﬂattered performingloans. On theone hand, interestratesreﬂected a borrow-er’screditrisk; on the other, provisions didnot. So loansto riskierborrowersmeanthigherrevenuesbutno correspondingpro-visions; and no provision wasmade whencreditworthinessdeclined, aslongas bor-rowerskeptservicingtheirloans. Banks’proﬁtsand capital positionswere thus, ineﬀect, overstated until loanswentawry.Timelierprovisionsmightnothave pre-vented the crisis, buttroublesmight havebeen admitted to sooner.In practice, bankswill increase theirloan-lossprovisions—in the EU, by13% onaverage, accordingto a reportpublished inJulybythe European BankingAuthority(EBA), a supervisor. The EBAestimatesthattheiraverage ratio ofcommon equitytorisk-weighted assets, a keymeasure of cap-ital strength, will drop by0.45 percentagepoints(ratiosare typicallyin lowdoubleﬁgures). Bankswith biggerstocksof duﬀloansthan average will take biggerhits.Forregulatorypurposes, the impactwill be softer. In calculatingcommon-equ-ityratiosand othergauges, the standardwill be phased in overﬁve years, in muchthe same wayaspost-crisiscapital stan-dardsknown asBasel 3. However, reckonsManusCostello ofAutonomousResearch,marketsare likelyto lookatthe full impactfrom the oﬀ, astheyhave with Basel 3.Noteveryone isconvinced thatIFRS 9 isan improvement. Quarterlycalculationsofthe 12-month expected losseson a widevarietyofsound assetsworth trillions ofeuroswill involve a lotofinformed guess-work. Thatwill give bigbanksa fairamountofdiscretion in modelling. Na-tasha Landell-MillsofSarasin & Partners,an assetmanager, worriesthatrather thanmakingprovisionsthatare too little, toolate, bankswill instead do “too much, toolate”. Forlong-term investors, she says,“upsand downsare nothelpful.”The EBAreported that72% ofbanksin-deed expectthe newstandard to make pro-ﬁtsmore volatile. When recessionsbiteand a lotofloansare moved from stage oneto stage two, provisionsmayrise sharply,in a “cliﬀeﬀect”. Thatcould in turn causebanksto curb lendingand worsen the eco-nomicdownturn. Thatsaid, the cliﬀmaynotbe vertiginous. MrCostello notes thataccordingto the EBA, underIFRS9 stage-three loanswill accountfor78% ofprovi-sionsand stage 2 forjust14%. So mostprovi-sionswill be more orlessastheyare now.Will banksprovide anymore prudently?Forthe answer, waitforthe nextcrisis.7Accounting and banksStage frightTimelierloan-loss provisions maymakeearnings and lending choppier66FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistNovember18th2017IFMAKINGAmerica greatagain isthe aim, youcould do worsethan bringbackthe economicgrowth ratesofthe late 1990s.PresidentDonald Trump’steam reckonsthatthe Republican taxplan makingitswaythrough Congresswill do justthat. “We arecreatinga model thatcreateseconomicgrowth in thiscountry,”saysGaryCohn, the directorofMrTrump’sNational EconomicCouncil. Kevin Hassett, who runsthe Council ofEconomic Ad-visers, reckonsthe bill should push growth above 4% peryear. Such heightsare notbeyond the realm ofpossibility, butifAmerica reachesthem taxreform will have little to do with it.Thatisnotbecause ofthe speciﬁcsofthe plan. Rather, itreﬂectsan underappreciated reality: taxreform can accomplish manythings, butraisinglong-run growth isnotgenerallyamong them.Mostassessmentsofthe Republican taxproposals, like mostanalysesofmosttaxplans, conclude theireﬀectson growth willbe small. The Penn Wharton BudgetModel, a non-partisan pub-lic-policyinitiative, projectsthatGDP in 2027 will be between0.4% and 0.9% higherasa resultofthe bill. Nonsense, saythe adherentsofthe supply-side school ofthinking. Economicgrowth can be broken down into changes inthe supplyoflabourand in labourproductivity. Supply-sidersreckon thatlowertaxrateson labourincome should raise itssup-ply; lowertaxeson capital income should, byincreasing savingand investment, nurture innovationswhich will eventuallyboostproductivity.The actual economics, alas, are lessstraightforward (see ta-ble). Taxcutsthatboostincome from employmentraise the costoftime oﬀ; this“substitution eﬀect” impliesthatpeople shouldworkmore when taxratesdrop. Butthere isan oﬀsetting “incomeeﬀect”: asearningsrise, demand formostamenities, includingleisure, also goesup. Although theorysuggestscutsto marginal taxratesshould fa-vourthe substitution eﬀect, the evidence ismore ambiguous. Insummarisingthe literature on the subject, the Congressional Re-search Service, the legislature’spublic-policygroup, notesthat inpractice neitherlabour-force participation norhoursworkedmove much in response to taxchanges. Amonghigh-incomemen, the eﬀectson laboursupplyare non-existent. Reported labourincome doesrise in response to income-taxcuts, thanksmostlyto reductionsin taxavoidance. That certainlymatters; eﬀortspenteludingUncle Sam representsan economicloss. Itisjustnotlarge enough to have a detectable eﬀect on long-run growth.The evidence issimilarlyambiguousaboutthe eﬀects oftaxcutson income from capital. In practice, savingsrates respond lit-tle, ifatall, to taxchanges. American savingsrateshave fallenoverthe past40 yearsdespite a decline in the eﬀective rate oftaxon capital income. Domesticsavingsare notthe onlysource ofin-vestable funds; Republicansclaim theirplan will attract agrowth-boostingwave ofmoneyfrom abroad. Butsuch ﬂowstend to occurslowlyand incompletely: a blessing, perhaps, forthe Trump administration, given the massive trade deﬁcits thatwould resultfrom a rapid, large-scale inﬂuxofcapital. Taxreform mightaﬀectﬁrms’ investmentdecisions. Butﬁrms’abilityto deductthe costofnewinvestmentsfrom their taxbillmutesthe incentivisingeﬀectsofchangesin the corporate-taxrate. And asLarrySummersofHarvard Universityhaspointedout, cutsto corporate taxdo notsimplyreward hungryinnova-tors, butalso increase the return on proﬁtsearned by behemothswith marketpower. Given evidence thatrisingindustrial concentration in Ameri-ca isunderminingcompetition, there isgood reason to worrythatrate cutswill pad the walletsofoligopolistsand theirshare-holders. (Awkwardly, CEOsconvened bythe Wall StreetJournalthisweekto attend a discussion with MrCohn mostlydeclined toraise theirhandswhen asked whethertheywould make newcapital investmentsifthe Republican taxplan were passed.) All told, a cutin the corporate-taxrate often percentage pointswould raise long-run outputbyonly0.15%, accordingto an analy-sisbythe Congressional Research Service. National incomewould rise still less, since much ofthe gain in GDPwould ﬂowtoforeign investors. Aswith income taxes, cutsin corporate-taxratesmake avoid-ance lessworthwhile; justimagine freeingup the time and talentspentcookingup clevertax-limitingstrategieslike the “Dutchsandwich” orthe “double Irish”. Yetsuch costsscarcelyregister inlong-run growth ﬁgures.Asome-zero gameIn otherrespects, however, changesto taxmake a world ofdiﬀer-ence. Theycan aﬀectgrowth a lotin the shortrun, especially afterarecession, when there isspare capacityaround waiting to be ac-tivated byincreased demand. Thatcountsforlessatthe moment.America haslessslackthan itdid earlierin the recovery, and theFederal Reserve, fearinginﬂation, mightoﬀsetthe stimulative ef-fectoftaxcutswith higherinterestrates. The budgetimplicationsare much bigger. The implacable re-sistance to governmentborrowingdisplayed byRepublicans inthe immediate aftermath ofthe GreatRecession, when biggerdeﬁcitsmighthave done a lotofgood, hascrumbled. GOPleadersacknowledge thattheirbill will increase governmentdebt by$1.5trn, orabout8% ofcurrentGDP, overthe nextten years. Moststrikingofall are the distributional consequences. Ac-cordingto an analysisbythe TaxPolicyCentre, the bill introducedin the House ofRepresentativeswill reduce the taxburden ofthetop 0.1% ofearnersbyan average of$278,000 by2027, comparedwith an average cutof$10 forthe bottom 20% ofearners.The Republican taxplan would eliminate ineﬃciencies in thetaxcode. Thatshould help the American economyrun a littlemore smoothly. Yetwith thisreform, asany, distributional andbudgetaryconsequencesare notsecondaryeﬀectsto be subordi-nated to a broadergrowth dividend. Theyare the main event.

In 2016 therewere about4,000 ofthem scatteredaround the world’shospitals, and theytookpartin 750,000 operations. Mostofthose procedureswere on prostate glandsand uteruses. Butrobotsalso helped sur-geonsoperate on kidneys, colons, heartsand otherorgans. Almostall ofthese ma-chineswere, however, the productsof asingle company. Intuitive Surgical, of Sun-nyvale, California, hasdominated the sur-gical-robotmarketsince itsdevice, da Vin-ci, wascleared foruse bythe AmericanFood and DrugAdministration in 2000. That, though, islikelyto change soon,fortwo reasons. One isthatthe continualminiaturisation ofelectronicsmeansthatsmartercircuitscan be ﬁtted into smallerand more versatile roboticarmsthan thosepossessed byIntuitive’sinvention. This ex-pandsthe range ofproceduressurgical ro-botscan be involved in, and thusthe size ofthe market. The otheristhatsurgical robot-icsis, asitwere, aboutto go generic. ManyofIntuitive’spatentshave recentlyexpired.Othersare aboutto do so. Asa result, bothhopeful startupsand established health-care companiesare planningto entertheirown machinesinto the ﬁeld. Though the word “robot” suggestsamachine thatcan do itsworkautomatical-ly, both da Vinci and itsputative competi-operatingtable asa surgeon pleases, orfrom one operatingtheatre to another asthe demandsofa hospital dictate. Thisway, the hospital need notdedicate a spe-ciﬁctheatre to roboticsurgery, and thenumberofarmscan be tailored to the pro-cedure athand. Unlike a da Vinci arm, which islike thatofan industrial robot, a Versiusarm isbuiltlike a human one. Ithasthree joints, corre-spondingto the shoulder, the elbowandthe wrist. Thismeans, accordingto MartinFrost, CMR’schiefexecutive, thatsurgeonswill be able to use anglesand movementstheyare alreadyfamiliarwith, instead ofhavingto learn a robot-friendlyversion ofaprocedure from scratch. The companyhasyetto decide howmuch the armswillcost, butMrFrostexpectsthatoperationswhich employVersiuswill workoutto beonlya fewhundred dollarsmore expen-sive than those conducted byhumansalone. With da Vinci, the diﬀerence canamountto thousands.Versiuswill compete with da Vinci onitsown turf—abdominal and thoracicsur-gery. Others, though, wantto expand ro-boticsinto newareas. Medical Micro-instruments(MMI), based nearPisa, inItaly, hasrecentlyshown oﬀa robot intend-ed forreconstructive microsurgery, a deli-cate processin which a surgeon repairsdamaged blood vesselsand nerveswhilelookingthrough a microscope. Thisrobotallowsthe surgeon to control a pairof min-iature roboticwrists, 3mm across, thathave surgical instrumentsattheirtips. MMI’sdevice doesawaywith the con-trol console.

Thatmeanshe can move as iftorsare controlled byhuman surgeons.Theyare waysofhelpinga surgeon wieldhisinstrumentsmore preciselythan if hewere holdingthem directly. Da Vinci itselfhasfourarms, three ofwhich carrytinysurgical instrumentsand one ofwhichsportsa camera. The surgeon controlsthese with a console ﬁtted with joysticksand pedals, with the system ﬁltering outanytremorsand accidental movementsmade byitsoperator. That, combined withthe factthatthe system useskeyhole sur-gery(wherebyinstrumentsenterthe pa-tient’sbodythrough small holesinstead oflarge cuts, makingprocedureslessinva-sive), reducesrisksand speedsup recovery.Butatmore than $2m forthe equipment,plusup to $170,000 a yearformainte-nance, da Vinci isexpensive.

If theydo, though, theyare usuallylethal if leftinsitu—butmuch harderto remove thanwhen theywere small. Auris’sdesigncould ease thisdilemma bypassingsurgi-cal instrumentsfrom the mouth into thetrachea and thence to the precise point in-side the aﬀected lungwhere theyare need-ed, in orderto cutawayonlyasmuch tissueasrequired. Auris, CMRand MMIare all startups.Buttwo giantsofthe medical industry arealso joiningthe questto build a better sur-gical robot. One isMedtronic, the world’slargestmakerofmedical equipment. TheotherisJohnson & Johnson, which hasteamed up with Google’slife-science divi-sion, Verily, to form a jointventure calledVerb Surgical.Like Auris, Medtroniciskeepingquietaboutthe design ofitsrobot. Butit hassaidthatitplansto begin usingiton patients in2018. Also like Auris, though, some infor-mation can be deduced from othersources. In particular, Medtronichas li-censed MIRO, a robotdeveloped byGer-many’sspace agencyforthe remote con-trol ofmechanical armsin space. MIROismade oflightweight, independentarms.These, presumably, could be ﬁxed directlyonto the operatingtable. Arobotbased on MIROwould letsur-geonsrelyon touch aswell assight, sinceMIRO’sinstrumentsare equipped withforce sensorsthatrelayfeedbackto the joy-sticksused to operate them, and thus to theoperator’shands. The lackofsuch hapticfeedback(the abilityto feel the softness oftissues, and the resistance theyoﬀer to thesurgeon’smovements) haslongbeen a crit-icism ofda Vinci. Surgeonsoften rely ontouch, forexample, to discern healthy fromtumoroustissue. Verb Surgical wasformed in 2015 anddemonstrated itslatestprototype to inves-torsearlierthisyear. ScottHuennekens, theﬁrm’sboss, saysthe machine will be par-ticularlysuitable forgynaecological, uro-logical, abdominal and thoracicsurgery. Robot, teach thyselfVerb wantsnotjustto build surgical ma-chines, butto getitsrobotsto learn fromone another.

One reason isthat“cancer” isan um-brella term thatcoversmanydiﬀerent dis-eases. Although the fundamental mecha-nism isalwaysthe same—the uncontrolledproliferation ofcells—the detailsvary enor-mously. Leukaemia isnotthe same asco-lon cancer. Even within a particulartype ofcancer, one patient’sdisease will diﬀerfrom another’s. Diﬀerentmutations, for in-stance, will aﬀectdiﬀerentgeneswithin atumour. The resultisthatcancercan befrustratinglydiﬃcultto treat.Medicine, though, isgettingbetter atac-countingforthese diﬀerences. In a paperjustpublished in Nature Medicine, a teamled byMeritxell Huch, a biologistat theGurdon Institute, a cancer-research centreatthe UniversityofCambridge, describesatechnique thatcould, one day, help doc-torsdesign bespoke treatmentsfortheirpatients, tailored to the precise characteris-ticsofthe cancerstheyare suﬀering from.DrHuch and hercolleaguesworkwith“organoids”, tinyreplicasoffull-sized or-gansthatcan be grown in the lab.

Cancerouscellscan alreadybe culturedin testtubes, where theyare available forpokingand proddingbyresearchers. But,saysDrHuch, when researchersextractsuch tissue theyoften bringhealthycellsalongwith it. Thatcan complicate geneticanalysisofthe tumours, bymixinghealthyDNAwith the mutated sort. Because tu-mouroidscontain onlycancerouscells, an-alysingthem should be easier. Amore signiﬁcantbeneﬁtisthat tu-mouroidsreplicate the structure ofthe tu-moursfrom which theyare derived in awaythatordinarycell culturesdo not.Cellsin a livingorganism are often notsymmetrical. The cellsthatmake the intes-tines, forinstance, need to knowwhichside facesinto the intestine and which sidefacesthe restofthe body. That, in turn,meansdiﬀerentgenesare expressed in dif-ferentpartsofa cell. In a conventional cellculture, much ofthisstructure islost. ButDrHuch’stumouroidspreserve it, makingthem a much more faithful reproductionofthe cancerfrom which theyare derived.Havingcopiesofa tumourin a dishmakesiteasierto conductexperiments onthem.

Nineteen ofthe 30 mostover-activegeneswere alreadyassociated with a poorprognosis, but11were newgenesforwhichsuch a linkhad notbeen suspected.

Forone, an inhibitor ofatype ofprotein vital fortumourgrowth,the researchershave managed to publishthe ﬁrstevidence suggestingthatit mightindeed be eﬀective. The abilityto growaccurate replicas ofreal tumoursshould help the huntfor bet-tercancerdrugsmore generally.

DrHuch hopeshertu-mouroidsmighthave directclinical appli-cations, too. The goal, she says, would be totake a patientwith livercancer, growcopiesofhistumourin a lab, and then testseveral diﬀerentdrugcandidatesatonce toﬁnd the mosteﬀective. Because tumour-oidsfaithfullyreplicate the cancers fromwhich theyare derived, a drugthatworksin the testtube should workin the patientaswell.

Hehasseen the tech industrygo from being abunch ofstart-upsrun bycountercultureidealiststo global companies. He nowworksatMicrosoft.

ButMrAmanatisa skilfulnarratorwhose use ofsourcesand anec-dotesisilluminating. Hisbookshould beread byanyone who iscuriousaboutthehistoryofpolitical philosophyand ideas. Itisespeciallystrongon cultural, liter-aryand intellectual historyand the rolethishasplayed in Iran’sinterpretations ofpolitical and clerical authority. MrAmanatdipsinto the livesand worksofkeyﬁgures,from those who articulated the country’sresponsesto European imperialism, suchasMirza Malkom Khan, a prominentmod-ernistwho died in 1908, to the ideologuesofthe Islamicrevolution of1979. These in-clude Jalal Al-e Ahmad and the left-leaningzealotsand poetswho used a mixofMarx-ism, Islamism, the Shia tropesofmartyr-dom and FrantzFanon’sthird-worldism togive Iran’sIslamicrevolution itsdistinctivecharacteristics. ItisMrAmanat’sabilityto drawout thebiggerthemesin Iran’shistoryasa Shiapowerhouse state thatsetsthe bookapart.He beginswith the creation ofthe Safavidstate in the early16th century. He explainsthe competingtensionswithin Persian Shi-ism oftemporal and spiritual legitimacy,intertwined with messianicrevivalism,mysticism and dissent. Putsimply, in a bat-tle between God and the crown, who winswhat, and why? Until 1979, the state had the upperhand.The clergywere there to preach, educateand sitin judgmenton the nation’ssouls. Apoliticallyactive clergywas, and still isformanyleadingShia thinkers, a heretical in-novation. MrAmanatexcelsatestablish-ing, through eventsand through thethoughtofitsleadingphilosophers, howPersian Shia political philosophycreatesthisnatural separation ofmosque andstate, aslongasthe state allowsfreedomand safetyofShia religiouspractice.MrAmanathighlightsanotherimpor-tantpointin Iran’spolitico-religiousmake-up when he tracesthe cyclical na-ture ofdivine revelation in “Twelver” Shiathought, through the 12 imams(descen-dantsofProphetMuhammad), and the12th imam’s“occultation” in 874. ThisfacetofShia philosophyoﬀersPersian politicalculture the potential formillenarian trendsto appearattimesofpolitical and socialcrisis. PresidentMahmoud Ahmadinejad’sconviction thatthe 12th imam waspoisedto return to dailylife in Iran meant that,amongotherlessinnocentactions, hewould layan extra place forthe 12th imamathisweeklycabinetbrieﬁngs. AyatollahKhomeini came to be known asan imam,which constituted a breakwith the notionofa quietist, apolitical clergy. This washe-retical amonglocal Shia communitiesandyetalso had precedentin Iran’smodernhistory, asMrAmanatillustrates.The exploration ofthiscentral tensionlendsMrAmanat’saccountofthe Islamicrevolution a deep historical resonance.The booktracesthistension through Iran’sturbulentengagementswith Western im-perialism into itslaterentanglements with20th-centurysuperpowers. Central to thedebate surroundingthe constitutional rev-olution thatbegan in 1905 wasthe place ofShiism in Iranian political life. Would theclergyretain theircontrol oversharialawand itsrole in shapingprivate life, orwouldtheybe subsumed bythe advance ofsecu-larWestern political ideas? Thatquestion came to dominate the na-tion’spolitical discourse, often under theshadowofreal and imagined threatsfromthe West. Ayatollah Khomeini’scontrover-sial doctrine ofvelayat-e faqih, the “guard-ianship ofthe jurist”, and itsapplication asthe ideological and constitutional blue-printforthe Islamicrevolution, was theﬁrsttime in Iran’sShia historythatthe cler-gyhad explicitlyarticulated a theory ofgovernment.

Theirbid forpowerchallenged the verysoul ofShia ortho-doxy. Itwasnota complete triumph, forthe 1979 revolution and itsaftermathcrushed the clergy’scenturies-old inde-pendence from the state. Despite the book’sextraordinaryrangeand detail, the readerisleftwonderingaboutthe ultimate place ofIslam and poli-ticsin Iran, and howthismightdevelop. Alegitimate question iswhetherthe IslamicrepublicofIran hasbeen the harbinger ofthe destruction ofthe Iranian clergy, bothin the mindsofthe Iranian people and asapolitical force. Have the clergybecome socrippled byassociation with the horrors ofthe Islamicrepublic—with itsmasspurges,itspolitical prisonersraped and tortured,and the children who were forced to walkovermineﬁeldsduringthe Iran-Iraq war—thattheyhave lostall moral authority withIranians? Mightthere be an upsurge in or-thodoxclerical opposition to the Islamicrepublicasthisuneasyexperimentin Shiapolitical activism comesto an end of sorts? MrAmanatdoesnotaddressthesequestions, butperhapshe doesnotneedto. He endswith the disputed elections of2009 in which MrAhmadinejad contro-versiallyreturned to poweramid repres-sion and violence.

Whyare we still doingmonologues?”Asa formerdirectorofthe Royal Col-lege ofArtin London who wenton toshape NewYork’sperformance-artscenein the 1970s, MsGoldbergwaswell-placedto diagnose artistictorpor. She workedwith artistssuch asLaurie Anderson, Phil-ip Glass, RobertLongo, Meredith Monkand CindySherman asa curatorattheKitchen, a renowned downtown venue.ButNewYorkin 2000 seemed to have littleinterestin artthatcouldn’tbe boughtorsold, and experimental artistswere in-creasinglydecampingto Berlin, Londonand Shanghai. To revive the performancescene in NewYork, MsGoldberglaunchedPerforma, a biennial ofperformance art, in2005. “I justthought, howcan we havethingsbubble up from the bottom?” MsGoldberginjected fresh energy intothe ﬁeld bycoaxingvisual artiststo createunique three-dimensional experiences.The resultingperformances, which haveincluded Rashid Johnson reimagining“Dutchman”, a raciallyfraughtplay, in anEastVillage bathhouse, and MsNeshat envisioninga theocratictrial in Iran, havehelped transform whathaslongbeen themostchallenging, leastaudience-friendlyart-form into must-see events.AsPerforma 17, the biennial’sseventhedition, splashesoutin venuesacross thecity(until November19th), manycreditMsGoldbergwith bringingthe medium intothe mainstream. “Performa wasmyeduca-tion,” saysJennySchlenzka, the newartis-ticdirectorofPerformance Space 122, oneofthe city’soldestperformance-artven-ues. Before she became a performance curatoratthe Museum ofModern Art(MoMA), MsSchlenzka studiouslyattend-ed everyPerforma event. Thisexposed herto worksbypioneerssuch asMarina Abra-movicand Joan Jonas, and introduced herto international artistsand up-and-com-ers, such asAdam Pendleton, whose workshe hasgone on to commission herself. “Nowyou’ll have a hard time ﬁnding acontemporary-artinstitution thatdoes notengage in performance art,” saysMsSchlenzka, noddingto more recentpro-grammingatMoMA, Tate Modern and theWhitneyin NewYork, amongotherplaces.The Shed, a centre forperformance and ex-perimental art, will open in NewYork in2019. “I do believe Performa played a rolein that.”Partofthe festival’sappeal isthe way itillustratesthe possibilitiesofperformance.ThisyearMsGoldbergcommissioned apiece from William Kentridge, a South Afri-can artistbestknown forhispolitically potentcharcoal drawings, printsand ani-mations.

Itdescribesten winter dayson a Finnish icebreaker, one ofa ﬂeet thatworksatperilouslyclose quarterswith ice-trapped cargo shipsin the BayofBothnia atthe northern limitofthe BalticSea. Itisa si-lentregion, almostemptyofbirdsand ani-mals, tidelessand still. He writesof seeingsilence, and the ship itselfseemsto him nomore than “the tip ofa pencil line trailingoﬀinto emptyspace”. Bythe end ofthe journey, the “shudder-ingemptiness”hasgotto MrClare. He de-scribesa nightmare in which he foresees aworld populated solelybyhumansandmachines: “no bird…no ﬂourish ofbeingin landscape, no iteration ofspiritin form”.Itisthe culmination ofa steadydrumbeatthrough the bookaboutpollution, warm-ingseasand human rapacity. All theworld’sshipsatsea today, he says, mea-sured asone nation, constitute the seventhmostpollutingcountrythere is. Hisship-matesare themselvesimplicated. One ofthem tellshim thaticebreakersalone canconsume 100 tonnesoffuel every24 hours,againstthe 1.5 tonnesa yearthatmightbeconsumed bythe average Finnish familyhouse. And yet, saysMrClare, the world remainslargelyunperturbed—“betterourgreat-grandchildren run outofplanet thanourchildren should lackforwhatever wecan grab.”Butforall that, MrClare’sbookissur-prisinglylighthearted, even playful. Thevoyage isa homage to a dearfriend, a manof“ludicdash and charisma”, whose un-timelydeath coincided with the birth ofMrClare’sson. In thatmoment, he wasseized with the sense that“some blaze-brightlightofwill and life”had passedfrom one to the other. Thatlightﬁlls hiswriting. MrClare isintoxicated byelemen-tal extremes, dizzied, broughtclose tolaughter. Hisdead mineral world—all crys-talline ice and hard metal—stirsand quick-ens. Ice “sidlesaboard, rindsthe rails withicicles…isall butalive”. While down be-low, in the engine room, there grow“vinesofcopperpipingand sproutingthermo-meters, the fuel pumpsbudded with boltsand ﬂoweringstopcocks”.Asforhisfellowseafarers, aroundwhom MrClare weavesmuch Finnish history, literature and politics, these “gentle, inward men”become, in a sense,hiswitnessesto the human spirit. He lovesthem fortheirjokesand stories, for theircourage and even fortheirFinnish silences:“relaxed silences, companionable…un-happy, charged and thoughtful silences,even lyrical silences”. MrClare isa greatenjoyer—ofpeople, landscape, and aboveall oflanguage.

Both assailantswere armed withmilitary-style riﬂes. WhydoesAmericanlawletpeople buysuch weapons? The answeristhe Second Amendmentto the constitution, which reads: “Awellregulated Militia, beingnecessaryto thesecurityofa free State, the right ofthe peo-ple to keep and bearArms, shall not be in-fringed.” (Commaswere used diﬀerentlyin the 18th century, butthese do notaﬀectmeaning.) Gun-rightsadvocatesinsist thesecond halfofthatsentence isabsolute. Those in favouroftighterregulationinsistthatthe framersused the ﬁrst clauseto tie gun-rightsto the need fora militia.Since no American state hasthe sort ofmilitia thatexisted in the 1780s(consistingofall able-bodied men, subjectto call-upatanytime and expected to bringtheirown weapons), thiswould make widercurbson gunslegal.Whatisthatclause doingthere? In the1960sPaul Grice, a philosopher, wrote hisseminal workson the unspoken rules oflanguage, howoften people observethem, and whattheydo when theybreakthem. He codiﬁed these into several max-imsofconversation nowfamousamonglinguists. One isthe “maxim ofrele-vance”: ifsomeone randomlyveersoﬀ-topictheybreakthatmaxim. The other isthe “maxim ofquantity”: speakersshould sayenough, butnottoo much. These maximscan be broken. Butbe-cause the maximsare so widelyunder-stood and observed, Grice argued, break-ingthem issigniﬁcant. When youhear aspeakerbreakthem, yourﬁrstinstinct istolookfornewmeaning. Forexample, imag-ine a man arrivinghome, and hiswifeasking: “Where were you?” Ifhe replies: “Iam notcheatingon you,” she would berightto be worried. Perhapsthe informa-tion wassupposed to be reassuring. But bybreakingthe maxim ofrelevance itsendsan entirelydiﬀerentmessage. Ortake the maxim ofquantity. Infor-mation should onlybe included fora rea-son. So whatisthe militia clause there for?Antonin Scalia tried to explain itin the Su-preme Court’sopinion in DCvHeller,which in 2008 upheld an individual rightto own and carrygunsforhunting, self-defence or, really, foranyreason. LikeGrice, Scalia thoughtthatthe clause shouldbe relevant. In fact, he insisted that itwas.England’sStuartkingshad disarmed thoselikelyto be disloyal. So an arms-keepingcitizenryreadyto musterasa militia, evenagainstitsown rulers, wasindeed “neces-saryforthe securityofa free state”. Scaliasaid thatprefatoryclausescan announce alaw’spurpose—butcannotrestrictit.Whyhave them, then? The writersofthe constitution could have included allmannerofphilosophical navel-gazing inthe prefatoryclause: “The rightofself-defence beinginalienable…” and soforth. Some state constitutionsdid men-tion self-defence in theirgun-rightsclauses. The federal constitution does not.Thismakesthe prefatoryclause a ratherodd bitofthroat-clearing. Ifthe framersmeantto include self-defence, itviolatesthe maxim ofquantitybysayingboth toolittle (itdid notmention self-defence) andtoo much (bynotbeingneeded atall).AlinguistatSan Diego State Universi-ty, JeﬀreyKaplan, arguesthatthe prefa-toryclause isfalse.

Hesaysthatin parallel constructions like “To-daybeingStPatrick’sDay, I will buydrinksforeveryone in the bar,” ifitturnsouttodayisnotin factStPatrick’sDay, thepromise in the main clause needs“re-pair”: a chance to cancel the oﬀeror nego-tiate somethingelse with the patrons. Heputthe StPatrick’sDayproblem to 50 ex-perimental subjects—80% said thatifthepresupposition wasfalse, the oﬀer wasnolongeroperative.

Oversupply in the market is likelyto continue as 140bn cubic metres ofliquefaction capacity that is under con-struction comes onstream, mostly inAmerica and Australia. Conventional gascurrently makes up 80% of global gasproduction; unconventional sources,such as shale, should account for morethan half of the addition to output.

Butmuch ofthe eﬀortexpended inpropulsion iswasted too: nobblylimbstend to create extra commotion.

Afarbetterapproach wastotal im-mersion. Notstayingin the waterfor ever,much ashe mighthave liked to had hebeen born with gillsora blowhole, butmental immersion in the art(more than ascience, he said) ofslippingthrough it. Since he coined the term in 1989, “TotalImmersion” hasbecome a bestsellingbook, a much-watched seriesofvideos, acoachingbusinessand a catchphraseamonghydrophilesthe world over. Itturned even the mosttimid novicesintosmooth, conﬁdentstrokemakers, andhoned the technique ofchampions.Armed with itsbreathingand concentra-tion techniques, swimmerscould leavetheirheated poolsand, like him, embarkon even the mostdauntingopen-waterswims, in cold, choppyseasacrosslongdistances. Strokes and folksThe idea waseasilyexpressed. Swim si-lently. Worrylessaboutthe powerof yourengine, and more aboutthe sleeknessofyourfuselage.

Thread yourhand through an imagi-naryslotin the water, he said, treating itlike the prowofa ship.

And each stroke, wheth-erthe ﬁrstorthe ten thousandth, should bethe same.Puttingitinto practice, though, washard, with the job mostlydone bythemind notthe body.

Hewasjustborn with heavylegs, he reck-oned. Theydragged behind him, lowin thewater, slowinghim down unlesshe madeprodigious, exhaustingkicks. Itdid notstop him beingan acclaimed swimmingcoach, buthe wasunderno illusionsabouthisown prowess: “terminal mediocrity”,he called itlater. Asa swimming-mad teen-ageron LongIsland, he had been too slowto win a place even in hisundistinguishedhigh-school team. He wasnevergoingtobe the bestswimmerin the pool, he reck-oned, so would have to settle forbeing thehardest-working. Itwasonlyin mid-careerthatthe lightbegan to dawn. Balance came ﬁrst: swim-ming“downhill”, with hishead low, shift-ed the body’scentre ofgravity, lifting thelegs. Afterthat, the insightsmushroomed.

Hisadvice wasindeed easyto caricature, buthe disarmed hiscritics byagreeingwith them. More muscle and fast-erpropulsion were great. Formostswim-mers, though, the biggestgainswouldcome notfrom extreme ﬁtnessbutintenseconcentration. The real gulfwasthathisapproach’smental focusand discipline owed more todance, tai chi and yoga than to the sweatyworld ofweightsand circuits.
