Itis divid-ed into ﬁve basins: the Paciﬁc,the Atlantic, the Indian, the Arc-ticand the Southern oceans.Were all the planet’swaterplaced overthe United States, itwould form a column ofliquid 132km tall. The ocean provides3bn people with almosta ﬁfth oftheirprotein (making ﬁsh abiggersource ofthe stuﬀthan beef). Fishingand aquacultureassure the livelihoodsofone in ten ofthe world’speople. Cli-mate and weathersystemsdepend on the temperature pat-ternsofthe ocean and itsinteractionswith the atmosphere. Ifanythingoughtto be too bigto fail, itisthe ocean.Humanshave longassumed thatthe ocean’ssize allowedthem to putanythingtheywanted into itand to take anythingtheywanted out. Changingtemperaturesand chemistry, over-ﬁshingand pollution have stressed itsecosystemsfor decades.The ocean storesmore than nine-tenthsofthe heattrapped onEarth bygreenhouse-gasemissions. Coral reefsare suﬀering asaresult; scientistsexpectalmostall coralsto be gone by2050.Bythe middle ofthe centurythe ocean could contain moreplasticthan ﬁsh byweight. Ground down into tinypieces, itiseaten byﬁsh and then bypeople, with uncertain eﬀects on hu-man health. Appetite forﬁsh growsnevertheless: almost 90%ofstocksare ﬁshed eitheratorbeyond theirsustainable limits(see pages18-20). The ocean nurtureshumanity. Humanitytreatsitwith contempt.Depths plumbedSuch self-destructive behaviourdemandsexplanation. Threereasonsforitstand out. One isgeography. The bulkof theocean isbeyond the horizon and belowthe waterline. Thedamage beingdone to itshealth isvisible in a fewliminalplaces—the GreatBarrierReef, say, orthe oysterfarms ofWash-ington state. Butforthe mostpart, the sea isoutof sightand outofmind. Itistellingthatthere isonlya single ﬂeeting referenceto the ocean in the Parisagreementon climate change. Asecond problem isgovernance. The ocean issubject to apatchworkoflawsand agreements. Enforcementishard andincentivesare often misaligned. Watersoutside national juris-dictions—the high seas—are a global commons. Withoutde-ﬁned propertyrightsora communityinvested in their upkeep,the interestsofindividual actorsin exploitingsuch areaswinoutoverthe collective interestin husbandingthem. Fish areparticularlytrickybecause theymove. Whyobserve quotas ifyouthinkyourneighbourcan haul in catcheswith impunity? Third, the ocean isa victim ofother, biggerprocesses. Theemission ofgreenhouse gasesinto the atmosphere ischangingthe marine environmentalongwith the restofthe planet. Theocean haswarmed by0.7°Csince the 19th century, damagingcoralsand encouragingorganismsto migrate towardsthepolesin search ofcoolerwaters. Greaterconcentrations ofcar-bon dioxide in the waterare makingitmore acidic. That tendsto harm creaturessuch ascrabsand oysters, whose calciumcarbonate shellssuﬀerasmarine chemistryalters. Some ofthese problemsare easierto deal with than others.“Ocean blindness” can be cured byaccessto information. Andindeed, improvementsin computingpower, satellite imagingand dronesare bringingthe ocean into betterviewthan everbefore. Workisunderwayto map the sea ﬂoorin detail usingsonartechnology. On the surface, aquaticdronescan get to re-mote, stormyplacesata farsmallercostthan manned vessels.From above, ocean-colourradiometryisimprovingunder-standingofhowphytoplankton, simple organismsthatsup-portmarine food chains, move and thrive. Tinysatellites,weighing1-10kg, are enhancingscrutinyofﬁshingvessels. Transparencycan also mitigate the second diﬃculty, ofocean governance. More scientiﬁcdata oughtto improve theoversightofnascentindustries. Assea-ﬂoorsoundings prolif-erate, the supervision ofdeep-sea mining, which isoverseenbythe International Seabed Authorityin areasbeyond nation-al jurisdiction, should getbetter. More data and analysis alsomake iteasierto police existingagreements. Satellite monitor-ingcan provide cluesto illegal ﬁshingactivity: craft thatswitchoﬀtheirtrackingdeviceswhen theyapproach a marine pro-tected area excite suspicion, forexample. Such data make iteasierto enforce codeslike the PortState MeasuresAgreement,which requiresforeign vesselsto submitto inspections atanyportofcall and requiresportstatesto share information onanysuspected wrongdoingtheyﬁnd. Clearerinformation mayalso help align incentivesand al-lowprivate capital to reward good behaviour. Insurance ﬁrms,forinstance, have an incentive to askformore data on ﬁshingvessels; ifshipsswitch oﬀtheirtrackingsystems, the chancesofcollisionsrise, and so do premiums. Greatertraceabilitygivesconsumerswho are concerned aboutﬁsh a wayto pressseafood ﬁrmsinto behavingresponsibly. SunkcostsThanksto technology, the ocean’sexpanse and remotenessarebecominglessformidable—and lessofan excuse forinaction.AUN meetingon the ocean nextmonth in NewYorkisa signthatpolicymakersare payingmore attention to the state ofthemarine realm. Butsuperiorinformation doesnotsolve thefundamental problem ofallocatingand enforcingpropertyrightsand responsibilitiesforthe high seas. And the eﬀective-nessofincentivesto take care ofthe ocean varies. Commercialpay-oﬀsfrom givingﬁsh stockstime to recover, for example,are large and well-documented; butthe rewardsthataccruefrom removingplasticfrom the high seasare unclear. Above all, bettermeasurementofglobal warming’seﬀecton the ocean doesnotmake a solution anyeasier. The Parisagreementisthe single besthope forprotectingthe ocean anditsresources. ButAmerica isnotstronglycommitted to thedeal; itmayeven pull out. And the limitsagreed on in Pariswillnotpreventsea levelsfrom risingand coralsfrom bleaching.Indeed, unlesstheyare drasticallystrengthened, both pro-blemsriskgettingmuch worse. Mankind isincreasingly able tosee the damage itisdoingto the ocean. Whetheritcan stop it isanotherquestion. 7Deep troubleHumans are wrecking the ocean.

Butnone could be more innocentthan eight-year-old Saﬃe Rous-sos, left. She wasone ofthe chil-dren, mostofthem teenagers,who ﬂocked to see Ariana Gran-de give a concertin Manchesteron May22nd.

Itsucceeded.ForBritain, which had been spared deadlybomb blastssince the attacksin London in 2005, thiswasproofofhowharditisto foil everyploteverytime (see page 45). Forthe world,which suﬀersattackscontinually, itraisesonce again the ques-tion ofhowto stop people who are determined to kill.You’ll neverknowThe motivesofthe bomber, a 22-year-old Libyan Briton calledSalman Abedi, mayneverbe clear. Some have suggested thatMsGrande, a conﬁdent, sexuallyliberated woman who in-spiresteenage girls, stood foreverythingjihadistsdespise.When IslamicState (IS) isin retreatin itsbase in Syria and Iraq,and isstrugglingin Libya amid civil warand oppression (seepage 38), perhapsthe attackwasa showofstrength.Butthere isa third possibility. IS hassaid thatitwantstoforce sympatheticMuslimsoutofa “greyzone” in which theydo notfullyembrace the jihadists’ “caliphate” because theystill feel loyaltyto the countrywhere theylive. If so, IScan useextreme violence to provoke an oﬃcial clampdown and tofeed the indiscriminate suspicion ofMuslims. With repeatedattacksin France overthe pasttwo yearsand horriﬁc crueltythisweek, ISmaybe tryingto triggeran anti-Muslim backlashthatitcan exploitto drive sympathisersinto itsarms.The reaction in Britain to the Manchesterbombingis a goodwayto thwartIS’splans. Aritual hasgrown up afterterrorist at-tacksthatincludesvigils, memorialsand testimonials. Itletspeople expresstheircollective griefin a secularsociety. ItalsogivesMuslim groupsa chance to distance themselvesin publicfrom jihadistsand forothercivicleadersto saythat the threatfrom ISdoesnotcome from Islam in general. Thatsends a sig-nal to Muslimsand non-Muslimsthatnow, ofall times, theymustbe tolerant. ItispreciselywhatISdoesnotwantto hear.YetifISsucceedsin stagingrepeated attacksin Britain, thisconsensuswill be atrisk—asin France, which isunder a state ofemergency. Even now, some commentatorsare callingfor ter-roristsuspectsto be locked up orelectronicallytagged. Thatwould be a mistake. To punish suspectswho face no criminalchargeswould illegallysingle outMuslimsfrom anyothergroup. ISwould have preciselythe recruitingmessage it wants. In the past20 monthsthe intelligence serviceshave bustedatleast12 plots. Theyare notaskingfornewpowers. The gov-ernmenthasputaside moneyformore staﬀ. With this attack,asanyother, there have been mistakesand missed leads. Thesecurityservicesmustlearn from them. Butthe focusshould also be on stoppingsympathisers be-ingdrawn into IS’sorbit. In Britain thatisthe job ofPrevent, agovernmentscheme to counterradicalisation ofall kinds. Pro-paganda isscrubbed from social media and counter-propa-ganda putin itsplace.

Now morethan ever, when anotherBritish-born Muslim hasstruck hishomeland, itneedsreﬁningand strengthening. 7The Manchester bombingAlmostis neverenoughThe bestanswerto a suicide-bomberis the scrupulous, iron-willed application ofthe lawWHENMichel TemertookoverasBrazil’spresidentfrom Dilma Rousseﬀ, who wasimpeached lastAugust, no onesawhim asa clean breakfromthe grubbypast. Membersofboth hisPartyofthe BrazilianDemocraticMovementand MsRousseﬀ’sWorkers’ Partyare beinginvestigated orhave beenconvicted in the Lava Jato(CarWash) probesinto scandals cen-tred on Petrobras, the state-run energycompany.

In2016, 74 ﬁrmsmade theirstock-marketdebut, compared with600 two decadesago. Thiswinnowingisunwelcome. Mergeractivity, which reducesthe numberoflisted ﬁrms, is damagingcompetition. Overregulation, which detersyoungerﬁrmsfrom ﬂoating, deprivesordinaryinvestorsofopportunities tobeneﬁtfrom America’scorporate successes. Lessobviousiswhythe ﬁrmsthemselves, ortheirinvestors,should care. Companiesthatonce had to go publicto raise cap-ital can happilyfund themselvesin private marketswith mon-eyfrom sovereign-wealth fundsand institutional investors.Unicorns, privatelyheld tech startupswith valuations exceed-ing$1bn, are common. Cash keepspouringinto the industry.ThisweekSaudi Arabia promised up to $45bn to a $93bn tech-nologyfund run bySoftBank, a Japanese technologyconglom-erate (see page 53). Given a choice between red tape and free-dom ofmanoeuvre, between quarterlyearningscallsandlong-term strategy, wouldn’tanyone in theirrightmind steerclearofthe publicmarkets? Actually, no. Take the argumentthatstayingprivate letsunicorns operatemore freely. The transparencythataccompaniesa publiclist-inghasitsown beneﬁts. Closeroversightmighthave morequicklyrooted outproblemsatTheranos, a blood-testing start-up whose $9bn valuation crumbled because ofdefectsin itsproducts. The rigmarole ofpublicﬁlingsand quarterly callsmightinjectmore sobrietyinto the brash culture ofUber, aride-hailingﬁrm. Astute startupslike Slack, an online messag-ingﬁrm, and Airbnb, a home-sharingsite (see page 51), have de-liberatelytaken on some ofthe accoutrementsoflisted ﬁrms,from regularauditsto respected CFOs.Asforthe costssaved bystayingprivate, some are beingtransferred from ﬁrmsto investors. Publiccompanies beartheexpense ofthe detailed reportingand formal governance pro-cessesneeded to keep outside investorsin touch. Unicornsmaybe undera weakerspotlight, buttheirinvestorsstill carryoutdue diligence and marketvaluations, which theypay forthemselves. The savingsofprivate ownership can be illusory. Even ifthe publicand private marketsare converging, cleardiﬀerencesremain. Private marketsare developingnew waysforstartups’ employees, the mostvaluable resource in tech-land, to cash in theirshares. Butpublicmarketsare farmore liq-uid: thatisone reason whySpotify, a music-streaming unicorn,isﬂirtingwith the idea ofa directlisting, whereby a ﬁrm gets atickerwithoutraisinganynewcapital. Private marketshave slowlyopened up to a widerpool ofinvestors, mutual fundsamongthem. Butthe inclusive natureofpublicmarketsoﬀersbetterprotection againstreputationaldamage.

More is notalways betterPrisonsare an essential tool to keep societysafe. A burglarwho islocked up cannotbreakinto yourhome. Amugger mayleave youalone ifhe thinksthatrobbingyoumeansjail. With-outthe threatofa cell to keep them in check, the strong andselﬁsh would preyon the weak, astheydo in countries wherethe state istoo feeble to run a properjustice system.Butaswith manygood things, more isnotalwaysbetter(see page 48). The ﬁrstpeople anyrational societylocks up arethe mostdangerouscriminals, such asmurderersand rapists.The more people a countryimprisons, the lessdangerous eachadditional prisonerislikelyto be. Atsome point, the costsofin-carceration startto outweigh the beneﬁts. Prisonsare expen-sive—cellsmustbe built, guardshired, prisonersfed. The in-mate, while conﬁned, isunlikelyto work, supporthis familyorpaytax. Moneyspenton prisonscannotbe spenton otherthingsthatmightreduce crime more, such ashiringextra po-lice orimprovingpre-school in rough neighbourhoods. And—crucially—lockingup minoroﬀenderscan make them moredangerous, since theylearn felonioushabitsfrom the hardcasestheymeetinside. America passed the pointofnegative returnslongago. Itsincarceration rate rose ﬁvefold between 1970 and 2008. Rela-tive to itspopulation, itnowlocksup seven timesas manypeo-ple asFrance, 11timesasmanyasthe Netherlandsand 15 timesasmanyasJapan.

Also, because massincarceration breaksup familiesand rendersmanyex-convictsunemployable, ithasraised the American povertyrate byan estimated 20%.Manystates, includingMrSessions’shome, Alabama, have de-cided thatenough isenough. Between 2010 and 2015 Ameri-ca’sincarceration rate fell by8%. Farfrom leadingto a surge incrime, thiswasaccompanied bya 15% drop. America isan outlier, butplentyofcountriesfail to use pri-son intelligently. There isample evidence ofwhatworks. Re-serve prison forthe worstoﬀenders. Divertthe less scaryonesto drugtreatment, communityservice and otherpenalties thatdo notmean severingtieswith work, familyand normality. Agood place to startwould be with mostofthe 2.6m prisonersinthe world—a quarterofthe total—who are still awaiting trial.Fora fraction ofthe costoflockingthem up, theycould be ﬁt-ted with GPS-enabled ankle braceletsthatmonitorwhere theyare and whethertheyare takingdrugs. Taggingcan also be used asan alternative to locking up con-victs—a “prison withoutwalls”, to quote MarkKleiman ofNewYorkUniversity, who estimatesthatasmanyashalf ofAmerica’sprisonerscould usefullybe released and tagged. Astudyin Argentina ﬁndsthatlow-riskprisonerswho are taggedinstead ofbeingincarcerated are lesslikelyto reoﬀend, proba-blybecause theyremain amongnormal folkinstead ofsittingidlyin a cage with sociopaths. Justice systemscould do farmore to rehabilitate prisoners,too. Cognitive behavioural therapy—counsellingprisoners onhowto avoid the places, people and situationsthatpromptthem to commitcrimes—can reduce recidivism by10-30%, andisespeciallyuseful in dealingwith youngoﬀenders.

Oregon, which insiststhatprogrammes toreform felonsare measured foreﬀectiveness, hasa recidivismrate lessthan halfashigh asCalifornia’s.

Butthatdoesnotmean thatthepressure on the open seashaseased. In 2013, the mostrecentyearforwhichfull data are available, 32% ofthe world’sﬁsh stockswere beingexploited beyondtheirsustainable limit, up from 10% in the1970s, accordingto the UN’sFood and Agri-culture Organisation. The amountofﬁshcaughtatsea hasbeen prettymuch ﬂat forthe pastthree decades, butthe share oftheworld’sﬁsh stocksthatare beingplun-dered unsustainablyhascontinued to in-crease (see chart1on nextpage). Overﬁshingisnotthe onlyproblem.Pollution, notablyfertiliserrun-oﬀ, dam-agesa lotofmarine ecosystems. There areestimated to be 5trn bitsofplasticin theocean, with over8m tonnesofthe stuﬀadded everyyear. Bythe middle ofthe cen-turythe sea could contain more plasticthan ﬁsh byweight, accordingto researchdone forthe Ellen MacArthurFoundation. Notall the harm comesdirectlyfromthe land; some comesvia the sky. Carbondioxide accumulatingin the atmospherehasso farraised the world’saverage sea-surface temperature byabout0.7oC. Thishaseﬀectsatdepth; when seaswarm uptheybecome more stratiﬁed, makingitharderfornutrientsin the watersbelow torise to where theyare mostneeded by ﬁshand plankton. Given this, itmightseem for-tunate thatthe ocean absorbsa fairbit ofthatcarbon dioxide, thusreducingthewarming. Butdoingso changesthe ocean’schemistry, makingitmore acidic. This isaparticularproblem forcreatureswith calci-um-carbonate shells—which includesnotjustcrabsand oystersbutquite a lot oflar-vae, too. Acidiﬁcation makescarbonatesmore likelyto dissolve.

Forthe sake ofthe hundredsofmillionsofpeople who depend on the ocean forlivelihoodsorsustenance, aswell as forthesake ofthe ocean itself, these human im-pactsneed to be reined in.

The problem isexacerbated bya lack ofevidence, which makesoverlypermissivequota-settingeasier. More investment inresearch and monitoringcould help. But indevelopingcountries, where the need is of-ten dire, there are frequentlyno resourcesto meetthatneed, and in manyrich coun-triesﬁshingisnota bigenough industry tomake such research a national priority.“We are notgood value forthe taxpayer,buthowcan youhave an island nationwithouta ﬁshingﬂeet?” asksPete Bromley,aformerﬁsherman who isnowmasterofSutton Harbour.Aquaculture boostersmightanswerthatﬂeetsare simplyno longerneeded.

Theone thatstarted in 2014, and isstill goingon, hasbeen the longestand mostdamag-ing; more than 70% ofthe world’scoralreefshave been harmed byit. Australia’sGreatBarrierReef, worth $4.6bn each yearto nearbyQueensland alone, hasbeen par-ticularlybadlyaﬀected. “Five orten yearsago, mostofthe discussion aboutcoralreefswasoverhowtheywould lookby theend ofcentury,” saysRustyBrainard, a cor-al expertatAmerica’sNational Oceanicand AtmosphericAdministration. “Nowthe talkisofwhethercoral reefswill sur-vive aswe knowthem to 2050 oreven2030.” Acidiﬁcation makesthe picture worse.Though itishard to distinguish the eﬀectsofchemistryfrom the otherproblemsthatbesetreefs, itseemsa fairbetthat an envi-ronmentwhere calcium carbonate ismorelikelyto dissolve will notbe good for them.Astudypublished lastyearbyresearchersatthe Carnegie Institution forSciencemade the pointclearlybyrunningde-acidiﬁed waterovera reef; the coralsperked up nicely.

Forthe Japanese emperor, karoshi, oratleastdeath in service, hastodate been mandatory, since no provision existsin the ImperialHouse Law, which governsthe monarchy, forvoluntaryretire-ment.

Ten monthsago, in a televised statement, Akihito hinted athiswish to step down. Age and declininghealth, he said, were takingtheirtoll and makingithard to perform hisoﬃcial duties to thefull. Those duties, he made itclear, were notonlyceremonial butinvolved connectingdeeplywith ordinaryJapanese.The country’spost-warconstitution stipulatesthatthe emper-orisno god-kingabove the law, ashe wasbefore the country’sde-featin 1945. Rather, he is“the symbol ofthe state…derivinghispo-sition from the will ofthe people” in whom, explicitly,sovereigntynowlies. Since even before accedingto the throne onthe death ofhisfather, Hirohito, in 1989, Akihito and hiscommon-born wife, Michiko, have shown a desire to bringthe monarchydown to the level ofordinaryfolk, sometimesliterally—for in-stance, kneelingon the ground astheyconsole victimsof Japan’sfrequentnatural disasters. In lastyear’sstatement, the emperorsaid thatunderstandingwhatwasexpected from him asthe sym-bol ofthe state involved nurturing“an awarenessofbeingwiththe people”. Hence hiscriss-crossingsofJapan, even to the remot-estplaces, were “importantacts” forhim.Ultranationalistsare disdainful ofsuch abasements. (Akihitoissaid to have been oﬀended when conservative scholars lastyearsaid he should juststickto prayingand carryingout Shintorituals.) Worse, in theireyes, ishowAkihito hassought forgive-nessfrom neighboursand formerenemiesforJapan’swartimeactions. The nationalistsdenythatJapan wasan aggressor orcommitted atrocities; theysayJapanese were the victims, includ-ingofnuclearbombing. Theycheerthat, afterthe war, Japan’sAmerican occupiersand political elite rebranded Hirohito, whowascomplicitin Japanese militarism, asa paragon ofpaciﬁsm. Akihito’simmense popularityshowsthatthe hardline na-tionalists, though inﬂuential, are in a minority. Amore open, ac-cessible imperial familyhastransformed the monarchy’sappealafterthe aloofnessofHirohito—even ifitwill be a while yetbe-fore the royalsbicycle to the supermarketlike Scandinavian ones.And so a groundswell ofsympathygreeted Akihito’srequesttobe allowed to retire (he suggested he could also spare the countryonerousoﬃcial mourningdutieswhen he eventuallydid popoﬀ).

Theiroccasional suggestionofa return to concubines(Akihito’sgrandfatherwasborn to one)isintended seriouslybutisa joke.Somethingwill have to give. Itnearlydid a dozen years ago. Atthattime, no potential heirto Naruhito seemed likely, and thethen prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, wasgettingready tointroduce legislation to allowwomen to reign, aswell as succes-sion down the female line.

Ifhe isright, calamitylooms. Eighteenmillion Americansbuyinsurance forthemselves, ratherthan through an em-ployer; itisthispartofthe insurance mar-ketthatlookswobbly. MrTrump thinks itscollapse would force Democratsto join hisreform eﬀort. And he isputtinghismoneywhere hismouth is. Indeed, hisadminis-tration ispartofthe problem.Insurersraised premiumsin the indi-vidual marketbyan average of22% in 2017.Theyhad been caughtoutbythe poorhealth ofenrolleeson Obamacare’s“ex-changes”, websitesthatserve a little overhalfofthe market, and thatoﬀersubsidiesto low- and middle-income buyers. No-bodywassure who would sign up to theexchanges. So the lawwassupposed toconﬁscate proﬁtsifinsurerspriced toohigh, and paycompensation iftheypricedtoo low. Butwhen insurersmade losses,Republicansin Congressblocked the “bail-out”. Addingto ﬁrms’ woes,the “individ-ual mandate”, a requirementthatevery-brake againstanydeath spiral. Above acap, the governmentpicksup the tab forthe 9m buyerswho receive subsidies,shieldingthem from higherpremiums. Butsubsidiesare no use ifthere isnobody sell-inginsurance to begin with. Insurerexitshave alreadyleftabouta third ofcountieswith onlyone seller. In April itbrieﬂylooked asif16 countiesaround Knoxville,Tennessee, would have no insurersin 2018,until BlueCrossBlueShield ofTennesseeagreed to step in. Manystateswill face sim-ilarlyprecarioussituations, especially inrural areas. On May24th Blue KCan-nounced thatitwasleavingthe Kansas andMissouri exchanges, potentiallyleaving 25countieswith no insurer.Who isto blame? The Trump adminis-tration’sapproach to the marketshasvacil-lated. On hisﬁrstdayin oﬃce, Mr Trumpordered agenciesto use whatlegal powertheyhave to dismantle Obamacare. In re-sponse, the taxauthoritiesweakened theindividual mandate. Butin April the healthdepartmentpenned rulesdesigned toshore up the market. Forexample, itshort-ened the annual period duringwhich theexchangesare open forbusiness, therebymakingitharderforpeople to waituntiltheyfall ill before signingup.Nowthe sabotage seemsto be back on.Atissue are subsidiesforso-called “cost-sharing”. Obamacare requiresinsurers tolowerout-of-pocketcosts, like deductiblesand co-payments, forthe poorestbuyers.The Treasuryissupposed to footthe bill(which will total $7bn thisyear).

Itdoesnothelp thatcostsharing subsi-diesare also the subjectofa legal battle. In2016 a federal courtruled them unconstitu-tional, afterthe House ofRepresentativessued to stop them.

Since MickMulvaney, the budgetdirector, sketchedoutthe Trump administration’sproposalin February, ithasbeen clearthatlawmak-erswould end up rewritingit. MrMulva-neywantsimmediate deep cutsacrossgovernmentthatare unpalatable even tomanyRepublicans. The ﬂeshed-outver-sion ofthe budget, released on May23rd,featuresa newpromise: to eliminate thebudgetdeﬁcitwithin ten years. The presidentwantsto leave Medicare,health insurance forthe old, and Social Se-curity(publicpensions) untouched. As aresult, achievingbudgetbalance requiresan unimaginablydeep cutto so-called“non-defence discretionary” spending,which includesthingslike education, sci-entiﬁcresearch and diplomacy. Thispart ofthe budgetwould shrinkby41%, afterad-justingforinﬂation, accordingto the Cen-tre forBudgetand PolicyPriorities, a left-leaningthink-tank. Thatgreatlyexceedsthe deepestcutthe administration had al-readyproposed for2018, ofaboutone-third, to the State Department. Entitlementprogrammesforworking-age people would be slashed. FederalfundingforMedicaid, health insurance forthe poor, would eventuallyfall bynearlyhalf(a greatercutthan in the House Repub-licans’ health-care bill). The budgetfor Sup-plemental Nutrition Assistance, whichhelpsthe destitute buyfood, shrinks byaquarter, aspartofthe burden ofsupportingthe poorisshifted to the states.Yeteven all thiswould be insuﬃcient toeliminate the budgetdeﬁcit, which is fore-castto swell to 5% ofGDPby2027 undercurrentlaw(because ofincreasingspend-ingon the aged). To getthe budgetto bal-ance, MrMulvaneyalso assumesthe econ-omywill growby3%, a targetthatwill bediﬃcultto reach in the demographic head-winds. Fastgrowth ﬁllsthe government’scoﬀersbyabout$2trn overa decade. The problem isthatSteve Mnuchin, thetreasurysecretary, hasalreadybanked that$2trn to payforthe taxcutsthatare sup-posed to sparkthe 3% growth in the ﬁrstplace. Anothercontradiction isthatthebudgetpredictsgrowingrevenue from theestate (inheritance) tax, which itpromisesto abolish. Itisone thingforthe executiveand legislature to disagree. Butthe Trumpadministration hasproduced a blueprintthatcontradictsitself. 7The budgetZero sumsWASHINGTON, DCThe White House’s budgetgoes fromunrealisticto innumerate“ITSHOULD be clearto everyone thatRussia brazenlyinterfered in our 2016presidential election process.” So declaredJohn Brennan, formerdirectorofthe CIA,ata hearingofthe House Intelligence Com-mittee on May23rd, addingthathe hadseen intelligence of“contactsand interac-tionsbetween Russian oﬃcialsand USper-sonsinvolved in the Trump campaign,”leavinghim with “unresolved questions”aboutwhetherRussian spookssuccessful-lyrecruited American helpers. He remem-bered a warningtelephone call he made inAugust2016 to the head ofRussia’sspyser-vice, the FSB, urginghisopposite numberto rememberthat, regardlessoftheir politi-cal aﬃliation, “American voterswould beoutraged byanyRussian attemptto inter-fere in the election.”Itisrare to heara spychiefsound insuf-ﬁcientlycynical aboutthe world, but MrBrennan managed it.

The waterthatalmost en-circlesthe fantasticallyfertile, sandy-loamsoil made ita natural prison camp. In 1861Sunnyside wasamongthe larg-est, richestplantationsin Arkansas. Itwasowned byElisha Worthington, who scan-dalised white societybyrecognisingtwochildren he fathered bya slave. After thewar, ascotton pricesplunged, itbelongedto John Calhoun, namesake and descen-dantofthe southern ideologue, and thento Austin Corbin: a robber-baron ﬁnancierand railroad speculator, who, asa found-ingmemberofthe American Societyforthe Suppression ofthe Jews, barred themfrom the hotel he builton ConeyIsland.Corbin installed a steamboatand a smallrailway, but, like manysouthern landown-ers, struggled to ﬁnd labour. He experi-mented with convicts, then hiton an alter-native: Italians.The levee wasn’tdryLike manypeople-traﬃckers, then andnow, Corbin had a man on the inside. HiswasDon Emanuele Ruspoli, the mayorofRome, who recruited workersfrom LeMarche, Emilia-Romagna and the Veneto.The ﬁrstbatch—98 families—sailed fromGenoa on the Chateau Yquem, a reputedlyrancid steamship thatarrived in NewOr-leansin November1895. The familiesclutched contractsshowingthateach hadboughta tractofland, on creditto be repaidin cotton crops. Aftera four-dayjourneyup the riverto Sunnyside, theyquickly re-alised thattheyhad been misled. “The ﬁrstyear, 125 people died,” saysLibbyBorgognoni, a magnetic81-year-oldwhose in-lawscame overon the ChateauYquem(hergrandfatherarrived later, afterdrawingthe shorteststrawofhisfamily’ssixsons). Hot, humid and swarmingwithmosquitoes, Sunnyside wasfecund butdeadly. Todayyoucan drive on a gravelroad on top ofthe levee between the ﬁeldsand the Mississippi, the wide, eddying riv-erand glacial tugboatson one side, cottonon the other, red-winged blackbirdsdart-ingbetween them. When the Italiansar-rived, the barrierwaslower, and ﬂoodswere common. The drinkingwaterwasﬁlthy; yellowfeverand malaria were rife.Climbinginto hishuntingtruck, Tom Fava,anotherlocal Italian-American, helps toﬁnd the disused cemeterywhere the vic-timslie.

Butrarelylike this. Heatand disease were theworstofit, butCorbin’stermswere oner-oustoo. The Italiansspoke little English;manywere illiterate. Buttheycould seethatthe land had been wildlyoverpriced.And while manywere farmers, MrsBor-gognoni admits“theyknewzip aboutcot-ton”. Anti-Italian and anti-Catholicpreju-dice swirled: 11Italianshad been lynchedin NewOrleansin 1891. MrsBorgognoni re-callsthat, well into the 1930s, localswouldroll the carwindowsdown and holler“Dago!” atItalian children.In 1896, sixmonthsafterthe ﬁrstItalianslanded, Corbin died in a buggyaccidentnearhisexotichuntinglodge in NewHampshire (he wassaid to have startledthe horsesbyopeninga parasol). Still, asecond boatload leftGenoa forEllisIslandin December. AnotherItalian also madethe trip from NewYorkthatyear. PietroBandini grewup in Forli, joined the Jesuitsand wassentasa missionaryto Montana’sNative Americans. Laterhe moved to NewYorkto ministerto put-upon Italians.

Atthe sametime, saysMrRanalli, the winemaker, thecooler, higherlandscape and temperateplateaus“feltlike cominghome”.Alistofthe pioneersisetched on amonumentoutside the town hall ofTonti-town, the name theychose in honourofHenri de Tonti, a 17th-centuryItalian ex-plorer. There were fewermosquitoesbut,to begin with, life remained hard. Theylived in abandoned logcabinswhile theycleared the land, stuﬃngthe cracks withlinen to keep outdrafts; Morsani, the stone-mason, hisbrotherand theirﬁve childrenshared a barn with several otherfamilies.Theysurvived on pasta, polenta and wildrabbits.

The localswere hostile: the Ital-ians’ ﬁrstchurch wassetalight, reportedlywith Bandini inside. He survived to warnthe barrackersthathiscompatriotswerehandywith ﬁrearms. (The second churchwaslostto a tornado.)Tontitown prospered, largelythroughhisingenuity. “Itwasalmostlike he was asaint,” saysMrRanalli ofBandini’sreputa-tion. He wasthe newtown’steacher, band-leaderand ﬁrstmayor, aswell asits priest.He negotiated to bringin a railwayspur. Heimported vines: the soil ispoorerthan inthe Delta, MrRanalli says, butthe drainagebettersuited to grapes. He washonouredbythe pope and Italy’squeen mother.When Edmondo MayordesPlanches,the Italian ambassador, visited in 1905,Tontitown wasthriving. Itsresidents were“happy, contented, prosperous”, desPlancheswrote. “Italy, the place oftheirbirth, wastheirmother, while Americawastheirwife.

Bandini died in 1917, butTontitown’ssuccessoutlived him. Duringprohibition,saysMrsPiazza, one ofthe museum’sfoun-ders, people hid wine barrelsin basementsand vineyards. The barson the windowsofthe Morsanis’ cellarwere added to com-plywith post-repeal rules, MrRanalli says.When he wasa child, in the 1960s, therewere still a fewold-timerswho spoke onlyItalian. Theyhad realised the Americandream, and theirown: from povertyin Ita-ly, via devastation in the Delta, to a life inwhich manyfamilieslived on streetsthatbore theirnames—Morsani and Ranalli Av-enues, Piazza and Pianalto Roads.That, foritscitizens, isthe moral ofTon-titown’sstory. Theirpride isjustiﬁed. Butthe travailsofthe Italiansin Arkansas reso-nate in darkerways, too.AmbassadordesPlanchesalso visitedSunnyside on hissouthern jaunt. Thescene wasmuch lesssalubrious. Three cot-ton factorsfrom Mississippi leased theplantation from Corbin’sheirs, usingille-gal methodsto importmore Italians.

Alongwith corn bins, cotton ginsand Baptistchurches, the Arkansasplains,like much ofrural America, are litteredwith placesthathintata hazycosmopoli-tan past: Moscow, Dumas, Hamburg.Forgive and forget“Have theyforgotten howwe gothere?”asksPaul Colvin, Tontitown’smayor, ofto-day’sxenophobes.

Mean-while, saysMrColvin, “small townsaregettingswallowed bythe bigtowns”, asWalmartand otherlarge employersturnplaceslike Tontitown into dormitorysub-urbs.

Tontitown still holdsan annual grapefestival, which once marked the grape har-vestand bytradition includesa feast ofthesignature dish, spaghetti and fried chicken.ButMrRanalli’sisthe onlycommercialvineyard left. “There’sveryfewfull-blood-ed Italiansthatstill live in thistown,” hesays.

Asoften happened indistantenclavesin pre-internetdays, theItaliannessossiﬁed—the dialectbaﬄing ac-tual Italianswhen theyinteracted withLake Villagers—then withered, like Tonti-town’s.

One ofthe mostinstructive involvesJoe Arpaio, a law-and-ordershowman defeated lastyearashe soughthisseventhterm aselected sheriﬀofMaricopa County—a sprawling, sun-baked tractofArizona thatincludesthe cityofPhoenix and ishome to nearly4m people. Aconcise explanation ofMrArpaio’sdefeatisthatlocalsgrewwearyofhisdistractingantics, even ifthe sheriﬀwasa starofconservative talkradio and TV.MrArpaio, who styled himself“SheriﬀJoe” and “America’sToughestSheriﬀ”, wasan authoritarian impresario.

He recruiteda posse ofvolunteersheriﬀ’sdeputies,who sportpolice uniformsand roaraboutin patrol cars. Whenthatfeltold, in 2011MrArpaio assigned a ﬁve-member“cold-caseposse”, ﬁnanced byconservativesacrossthe country, to investi-gate whetherBarackObama had faked evidence ofhisbirth inAmerica. While lesserrivalsacquired militaryhardware from thePentagon, MrArpaio secured a tank(actuallya self-propelledhowitzer). He made the action ﬁlm starSteven Seagal a possememberand lethim drive thattankthrough a local man’sgardenwall in search ofillegal cockﬁghting. SheriﬀJoe’sfanscheeredwhen he ordered immigration sweepsthattargeted people whoappeared to be non-white orHispanic. He wasan earlyTrumpbacker, declaring: “EverythingthatI believe in, he believes in.” HeyJoeBy2016 manyconservativeshad stopped chortling. Countytax-payershad bythen paid tensofmillionsofdollarsin legal feesand settlementsforlawsuitsagainstthe sheriﬀ’sdepartment, in-cludingforprisonerdeaths. MrArpaio faced chargesfor criminalcontempt, afterallegedlydefyingcourtrulingsto stop racial pro-ﬁling. The Pentagon asked foritshardware backafterseveralweaponswere lost. Amid thisdysfunction a veteran Phoenix po-lice sergeant, Paul Penzone, ran forsheriﬀasa Democrat andwon. He did notcall Arpaio supportersbigots. He told them thattheirmoneyhad been squandered and thatlawenforcement hadsuﬀered. Thatback-to-workmessage won MrPenzone 158,000more votesthan HillaryClinton received in Maricopa County, ashe picked up supportfrom Republicanswho were eitherembar-rassed byMrArpaio, ordecided thathe wasa blowhard whobored them. SheriﬀJoe’sgimmicks“weren’tdoingitforhim anymore”, summarisesDavid Berman, a political scientistat ArizonaState University.

He isthe second president inthe space ofa yearwho isﬁghtingto stayinoﬃce in the face ofallegationsofwrong-doingand dismal poll ratings. Hisprede-cessor, Dilma Rousseﬀ, wasimpeached in2016 on a technical violation ofpublic-ac-countinglaw. The allegationsagainst MrTemerare fargraver, buthischances ofre-mainingpresidentmaybe brighter.Whetherhe staysorgoes, the accusationsagainsthim are momentous. The blowtohisprestige and inﬂuence will delay, andmightdestroy, vital reformsto Brazil’seconomy, which isonlybeginningtoemerge from itsworst-everrecession. MrTemer’swoesbegan on May17thwhen O Globo, a newspaper, reportedthat, on a tape recorded byJoesleyBatista,abillionaire businessman, he isheard en-dorsingpaymentofhush moneyto a poli-tician jailed forhisrole in the Petrobrasscandal. Thisoriginallycentred on thestate-run oil companybuthasexpandedbeyond it. In a related sting, police ﬁlmedRodrigo Loures, a congressman from MrTemer’sPartyofthe Brazilian DemocraticMovement(PMDB) and formerlyhisright-hand man, acceptinga bagwith 500,000reais($153,000) in cash. MrTemersolicitedmillionsin irregularpayments, claimed MrBatista and a subordinate. MrTemerhasprotested hisinnocenceparentlyspattered on himself. When Joes-leyBatista boastson the tape ofhaving twojudgesand a prosecutorin hispocket, MrTemermerelymurmurs, “great, great”.The political calculusofhisallies incongresscould be asimportantastheweightofthe evidence, and will partly de-pend on it. Hismostimportantfriend isRo-drigo Maia, the speakerofthe lowerhouse,who hassignalled thathe will shelve thedozen impeachmentmotionsthathavebeen ﬁled so far. Two medium-sized par-tieshave quitthe PMDB-led coalition, buttheirministershave clungon to their cabi-netposts. The PSDB, the biggestcoalitionpartner, seemsunsure whatto do. Theyare hesitantin partbecause MrTemerhasno clearsuccessor(he wasMsRousseﬀ’svice-president, butdoesnothimselfhave a deputy). MrMaia will takeovertemporarilyifMrTemerisimpeachedorindicted. Ifhe leavesoﬃce deﬁnitively,congresswill have 30 daysto choose a suc-cessorto serve the restofhisterm, whichendsatthe end ofnextyear. Thatperson would carrythe stigma ofelection bya congressmired in corruption.Anypolitician with the skill to pilot re-formsthrough the legislature is, like MrMaia, alreadyunderinvestigation, or sooncould be. Otherpotential successorsareCármen Lúcia, the respected chiefjusticeofthe supreme court, and Henrique Mei-relles, the ﬁnance minister, who has thenousto serve aspresident. ButMsLúcia isnota politician and MrMeirelleswaschairman ofJ&F, the Batistas’ holdingcom-pany. Nelson Jobim, a formerminister,worked forBTG, a bankwhose founderwasarrested in the Petrobrasaﬀair.

Five yearsago we stopped publish-ingthe inﬂation ﬁgure forArgentina pro-duced bythe governmentofPresidentCristina Fernándezde Kirchnerbecausewe, and manyothers, thoughtitwas bo-gus. We substituted an inﬂation numberdrawn up byPriceStats, an internationaldata service. Ayearlaterthe IMFfollowedourlead, formallycensuringArgentinafor“inaccuracy” in itsdata.Thisweekwe are delighted to resumepublication ofthe oﬃcial inﬂation num-berforArgentina. One ofthe ﬁrst thingsthatMauricio Macri did afterhe was elect-ed asthe country’spresidentin Novem-ber2015, defeatingMsFernández’scandi-date, wasto restore the professionalindependence ofINDEC, the statistical of-ﬁce. He charged itwith drawingup a new,accurate inﬂation index. Thismonthmarksa yearsince thisindexwaslaunched. Itshowsthatinﬂation in great-erBuenosAiresin the 12 monthsto Aprilwas27.5%. Thatﬁgure isuncomfortablyhigh, butrefreshinglyhonest. Under MsFernández, INDECfound thatinﬂation in2008-13 averaged about10% a year, be-tween a third and halfofprivate esti-mates. Underpressure from the IMF,INDECraised itsestimate to 24% in 2014,butprivate calculationswere higher still.High inﬂation waspartofthe sceneryin Latin America until the 1990s. Thatwasin large parta consequence ofinequalityand populistpolitics. Small butpowerfuleconomicelitesresisted taxincreases, sogovernmentsresorted to printingmoneyto fulﬁl theircampaign promisesto theworkingand middle classes. The rulers re-lied on “moneyillusion”: thatwage earn-erswould notice theirrisingnominal sala-riesratherthan the erosion oftheirpurchasingpower. High inﬂation discour-aged savingand contributed to inequali-ty—the rich could more easilyhedgeagainstitthan the poor.Taminginﬂation bycuttingﬁscal deﬁ-citsand openingeconomiesto trade andcompetition wasan importantachieve-mentofthe much-derided WashingtonConsensusin Latin America.

The newoﬃ-cial indexbroadlyagreeswith the manyprivate onesthathave sprungup. INDECwill launch a national indexin July.No longerconcealed, inﬂation is prov-ingstubborn. The central bank, whose in-dependence hasalso been restored underFederico Sturzenegger, itsnewgovernor,seta targetof12-17% thisyear. Itisnot goingto meetit. Aftertumblingin the secondhalfoflastyear, inﬂation hascrept up thisyear. Thatispartlybecause the govern-menthasraised electricityand gas tariﬀs,and partlybecause wage settlements bythe powerful trade unionsare averagingaround 20%.The bankisdoingitsbestto hit the tar-get: itraised itsbenchmarkinterest ratelastmonth (from 24.75% to 26.25%) eventhough economicgrowth isstill slow.

As itturned out, though, the Middle Eastern legofMrTrump’snine-daymaiden voyagewasone ofthe lesstumultuousperiods ofhispresidencyso far. Nonetheless, with afurthertilttowardsSaudi Arabia and theSunnis, and againstIran and the Shias, thepresidenthasincreased, notsmoothed, thetensionsthatso bedevil the area.In Riyadh, where he arrived on May20th, MrTrump attempted to resethis rela-tionship with the Muslim world, strainedbyhisown Islamophobicrhetoric. “I thinkIslam hatesus,” he said lastyear, after call-ingfora blanketban on MuslimsenteringAmerica. Butin a speech on May21sthe de-clared thatthe ﬁghtagainstextremism is“abattle between good and evil”, not“be-tween diﬀerentfaiths”. Blamingmostofthe region’sproblemson terrorism, heurged hisaudience ofSunni Muslim lead-ersto “drive out” extremists. “Drive themout,” he repeated, ﬁve times.The message wentdown well. The au-dience, consistingmostlyofautocrats anddictators, spouted gushersofﬂattery. “Youare a unique personalitythatiscapable ofdoingthe impossible,” said Abdel-Fattahal-Sisi, Egypt’spresident. “I agree,” said MrTrump, whose mood mayhave been liftedbythe giganticportraitsofhimselfthat hishostshad putup all around Riyadh. Hereal elections—attacked by[MrTrump] inthatbastion ofdemocracy& moderation,”wrote Iran’sforeign ministeron Twitter, re-ferringto Saudi Arabia.In manyways, MrTrump’strip to Ri-yadh reﬂected an attemptto breakwith theforeign policyofBarackObama, who in2015 strucka deal with MrRouhani’sIranto curb Iran’snuclearprogramme in ex-change forthe liftingofsanctions. The re-alignmentupsetthe Saudis, who gave MrObama a cool welcome on hislasttrip tothe kingdom. Bycontrast, MrTrump wasgreeted byKingSalman with lavish pag-eantryinvolvingdancing, swordsand amysteriousglowingglobe (pictured).In practice, though, lesshasso farchanged thatitmightseem. MrTrump hasnotyetripped up the nucleardeal, whichhe once called the “worstdeal in history”,butwhich hisadministration saysIran ishonouring. Justbefore he arrived, he ex-tended a waiveron (separate) sanctions onIran. And, like MrObama, he said hewould avoid “sudden interventions” inthe region. Manyofthe armssalescelebrat-ed byMrTrump had actuallybeen negoti-ated underhispredecessor. MrObama,though, had putmuch ofthe package onhold, fearingthatAmerican armswouldbe used to kill civiliansin Yemen andmightaccelerate the armsrace with Iran. Is thatall there is?MrTrump then moved on, arrivingin Isra-el on May22nd. Even before hisinaugura-tion, he had spoken ofhisdesire, as a mas-ternegotiator, to deliverwhathe calls the“ultimate deal”—peace between Israel and made clearthat, unlike hispredecessor, hewould notpressArab leaderson such mat-tersashuman rights, so longasthey see eyeto eye with him on securityand com-merce. “We are nothere to lecture,” he said. MrTrump announced the sale ofmili-taryequipmentworth $110bn to Saudi Ara-bia, the openingofa newcentre in Riyadhto combatextremistideologyand anotherthatwill targetterroristﬁnancing. Yetbe-hind the smiles, there istension. The king-dom, which MrTrump once called “theworld’sbiggestfunderofterrorism”, hasspentbillionsofdollarsspreadingits ultra-conservative brand ofIslam. Some say thatMrTrump’sstrategyisshort-sighted.

In Bethlehem MrTrump lec-tured Mahmoud Abbas, the presidentofthe Palestinian Authority, that“peace cannevertake rootin an environmentwhereviolence istolerated, funded and even re-warded.” In hisspeechesin Jerusalem hemade do with vague platitudesabouthow“both Israelisand Palestiniansseeklives ofhope fortheirchildren.”Israeli and American oﬃcialsinsistedthatin closed talksthe presidenthad insist-ed thathe isseriousaboutmakingpeace.Butfornowatleast, he seemsto be contentwith lettingthe two sidesworkoutthe de-tailsforthemselves. Manyobservers, per-hapsnaively, had expected some sign ofincreased pressure on Israel to make com-promises. MrTrump gave no hintofthat.The presidentdid make one concessionto the Palestinians, which will have comeasa disappointmentto the more hawkishelementsin the rulingcoalition. He point-edlyignored requeststo recognise implicit-lyIsraeli sovereigntyoverthe eastern partofJerusalem, captured 50 yearsago nextmonth. Israeli oﬃcialswere notinvited tojoin him on a visitto the Church oftheHolySepulchre and the Western Wall in Je-rusalem’sOld City. Neitherdid he showanyindication ofbeingreadyto fulﬁl acampaign promise to move America’sem-bassyfrom Tel Avivto Jerusalem. Still, there wasplentyin MrTrump’sstatements, duringa visitthatlasted littlemore than 24 hours, thatwasmusicto MrNetanyahu’sears. He extolled “the un-breakable spirit” and “the accomplish-mentsofthe Jewish people”; and spoke ofIsrael and America’s“shared values”. Hepromised thatwhile “Iran’sleadersrou-tinelycall forIsrael’sdestruction—notwithDonald J. Trump. Believe me.”Goingoﬀ-scriptin one ofhisspeeches,MrTrump contrasted hissupportforIsraelwith the previousadministration’scool-ness, sayingitwasa “big, big, beautiful dif-ference”. DuringMrObama’spresidency,despite hisrockypersonal relationshipwith MrNetanyahuand theirdeep dis-agreementoverthe Iran deal, Israel en-joyed unprecedented levelsofAmericanmilitaryaid and intelligence-sharing. Butthe Obama administration also workedtirelesslyto push forward the diplomaticprocesswith the Palestinians, without re-sult. The lavish praise and unspeciﬁcpromisesofMrTrump probablymean thatMrNetanyahucan nowgive hisheelsa restfrom diggingin. 7WHILE the leaderofthe free worldbopped with sword-wavingArabprincesand denounced the ancientPer-sian enemy, Iranian voterson the otherside ofthe Gulfdanced fordetente.

Butthe lasttime itdid so, in 1989, itpicked the thenpresident. “The vote isn’tjustaboutfouryearsofpresidency,” saysa conﬁdantofMrKhamenei. “It’saboutIran’sfuture for40 years.” MrKhamenei issaid to favourMrRaisi ashissuccessor; thiswill be hard-erto pull oﬀfollowinghisdrubbing. Overcomingpastdivisions, the hard-linersunited behind a single candidate.Theypacked rallieswith the basij, theiryouth militia, and brandished Hizbullahﬂagsaloft. MrRouhani gotoutthe vote bysoundingmore liberal. In the lastdays ofthe campaign he tongue-lashed the reli-giouszealots. He needed a heftymajority,he told voters, to promote civil libertiesand to hold to accountthe RevolutionaryGuard, the judiciary, the state media, pow-erful clerical charitiesand all who “shamefreedom”. Iran’spiousconservatives, hesaid, have “onlyexecuted and jailed, cutouttonguesand sewed mouthsshut.” Thismessage won people over.

Chaoshasbeen the norm in Libya sincethe uprisingthattoppled MuammarQad-daﬁ in 2011. Myriad armed groups, looselyaligned with rival governmentsin the eastand west, vie forpower. AUN-backedpeace deal, signed bysome ofthe adver-sariesin 2015, hasfailed to unite the coun-tryorcreate an eﬀective state under the“governmentofnational accord” (GNA).

Butthere are perhaps3,000 jiha-distsofall types. In a sign ofhowﬂuidthingsare, IS isnowsaid to be receivingsupportfrom local al-Qaeda ﬁghters, de-spite feudingbetween the groups’ leadersabroad.

AsRussia massed itsforceson the borderwith Ukraine, mostobservers(and participantssuch asMr Gir-kin) expected a swiftinvasion followed byannexation. Instead, the Kremlin createdan ersatzcivil war, absurdlyportraying theKievgovernmentasa “fascist” regime andthe separatistsasfreedom ﬁghters.

Yetsuch solidar-ityisuncommon amongcivilians. Most ofthe local population in Avdiivka, accord-ingto MrSamarsky, are noton hisside.

The waragainstcorruption isonlystarting, and the ﬁghtingiscarried outoﬃce byoﬃce, ministrybyministry.

One ofthe mainsourcesofcorruption thatfeedsthesystem, state procurement, hasbeenslowlyoverhauled, producingsomepositive results. In 2016 the health ministrylaunched afour-yearprogramme to outsource pro-curementofmedicinesto internationalagencies. In the past, bureaucratsalliedwith suppliersto inﬂate prices. With oneofEurope’sfastest-growingHIVepidem-icsand manyotherhealth emergencies,thiswasa burden Ukraine could notaﬀord. PatientsofUkraine, an NGO, hasestimated that1,600 Ukrainiansdie dailyfrom the resultinglackofmedicine.The health ministrycontractedCrown Agents, a British-based devel-opmentagency, and two United Nationsbodiesto buymedicineson itsbehalf.Theiryearhasnotbeen easy, with redtape causingdelays. Butwhen the ﬁrstyear’sresultscame backin December,theyshowed a 38% savingcomparedwith 2015, withoutcompromisingon thequalityofthe drugs. Whereasbefore twoorthree suppliersdominated supply,Crown Agentshave broughtin almost 30,thusdefeatingthe trickspreviously usedto cornerthe market.Alexandra Ustinova ofPatientsofUkraine mischievouslysuggested thatCrown Agentshad been “lucky” to winthe oncologycontract, since itincludedthe drugswhose priceshad previouslybeen mostinﬂated bycorruption. But sheacknowledged the agency’ssuccessincuttingcosts, alongwith thatoftheUNDP, which saved $4m outof$39massigned to buymedicinesforHIV, tu-berculosisand otherinfectiousdiseases. The auditorofCrown Agents’ ﬁgures,PrashantYadavofthe UniversityofMichigan, said itwashard to sayhowmuch ofthe savingswere from curbingcorruption, and howmuch from beingmore competentthan the bureaucratswho used to be in charge. Buttheywerehigh. “We would expectto see savingslike thisin verysmall markets, in Africa,”he said. “Adecade ago.”Thismaybe a small victory, buttheﬁghtagainstcorruption israrelywon bytanks. Asthe ﬁghtingintensiﬁes, thecorruptsystem isstartingto push back.Some politiciansare even attempting totarnish the name ofone ofthe country’smostrespected anti-corruption organisa-tions, the Anti-corruption Action Centre(AntAC). The group hasreceived grantsfrom Western donors, and pushed tocreate an anti-corruption prosecutor’soﬃce, makingitselfplentyofenemies inthe process. AlexanderMartynenko, thehead ofInterfaxUkraine, a newsagency,saysAntAC’sfoes, unable to ban it, aretryingto discredititin the eyesof itssponsorsand cutitoﬀfrom fundingsources.

MrPoroshenko’sposition maybe weakerthan itseems. In February, a small group ofUkrainian irregularsand volunteersblocked railwaytraﬃcacrossthe line ofcontrol,haltingfreightbetween the sepa-ratistterritoriesand the restofUkraine. MrPoroshenko opposed the blockade, butitsslogan, “No trade in blood”, caughton.Supportforthe blockade soared from 7% toover50%, accordingto polls. Unable to beatthem, the governmentjoined them, imposinga trade and energyblockade on the occupied territories. Thisdisturbed the situation in Donetsk. Theseparatistsresponded byseizingcontrol ofall ofthe coal minesand steel and chemi-cal plantsowned byRinatAkhmetov, Uk-raine’srichestoligarch. MrAkhmetov wasnotonlythe biggestemployerin the occu-pied territoriesbutalso theirgreatest bene-factor, providingup to 400,000 humani-tarian food parcelspermonth to theelderlyand those in need. The parcels havenowbeen stopped bythe separatists, andMrAkhmetov’s56,000 well-paid minersand workershave losttheirincome. When MrAkhmetov’sworkersat-tempted to protest, theywere metwith amixture ofthreatsand bribesbythe sepa-ratistsand theirRussian backers. The min-ers’ protestswould have destroyed the illu-sion the Russianshave tried to create ofamodel Soviet-era proletarian city. The half-emptycityhasbeen keptspotless, thelawnsmowed and pavementssweptclean. Oksana Mironova, who livesin Do-netskand managesa medium-sized busi-nesson the Ukrainian side, saysthe sepa-ratistsare tryingto introduce the symbolsand attributesofa state and create an im-pression ofpermanence. Yetitremains agangster-run territory: “Theyputon lip-stickbutforgotto wash theirnecks.”Unable to oﬀermuch ofa future, theseparatistsare cultivatingthe symbols ofthe Sovietpast. On May11th, theymarkedthe third anniversaryoftheir“republic”with a Soviet-style march. Avoice boomedfrom loudspeakers: “We greetthisdaywithjoyand pride fora gloriouspastand in con-ﬁdence fora peaceful and happyfuture.”Workerswith balloonsand Sovietﬂagsmarched in columnsalongLenin Prospect.Yetkeepingup a Sovietveneermaynot beeasywithoutjobs, particularlyasindustri-al production plummets. Howeverdisillusioned mostpeople inDonetskfeel with the “Russian spring”,fewbelieve thatthe territorycould ever bereincorporated into Ukraine. Butitis notjustUkraine and Russia thathave been en-gaged in a game ofmake-believe. So hasthe West, whose leaderscontinue to en-dorse the Minsk-2 ceaseﬁre agreement,while privatelyadmittingthatitisdead. From the time Minsk-2 wassigned twoyearsago, itwasdesigned to maskan eﬀec-tive defeatofthe Ukrainian armybyRus-sian forces. The agreementcallsforRussiato return control overitsborderand overthe separatistterritoriesto Ukraine, some-thingitwill neverdo. Ukraine, meanwhile,lacksthe militarypowerorWestern sup-portto take itbyforce. America has refusedto arm Ukraine with lethal weapons, letalone ﬁghton itsside. Some Western poli-ticiansargue thatitwould be more honestand productive to pronounce Minsk-2dead and enforce the currentline ofdivi-sion between the separatistsand the rest ofUkraine with an armed peacekeepingforce. Ukraine, the argumentgoes, wouldlose onlya swatch ofland which itdoes 42EuropeThe EconomistMay27th20172notcontrol anyway. And itwould preventthe restofthe countryfrom beingfrozen inapermanentstate ofwar.The problem isthattoo manyparties inthisconﬂicthave an interestin keeping upthe charade. Thisincludesboth MrPorosh-enko and VladimirPutin, Russia’spresi-dent. Both have rejected anytalkofchang-ingthe Minsk-2 agreement, asthiswouldundermine theircredibility. Yetneither isinterested in takingformal responsibilityforDonbas. MrPoroshenko’slegitimacyrestsalmostentirelyon the ﬁghtagainstRussia, and he hasno interestin lettingDonbasvote in the presidental elections in2019. The Kremlin doesnotwanteither topayforDonbasorto limititsoptions inmeddlingin the restofUkraine. Yetleavingthingsastheyare does notmean theywill staythisway. AsMrGirkinsaid recently:“soonerorlater[Russia] willhave to face eithera victoryora defeat. Amilitaryconfrontation isinevitable.” Hisideal outcome would be a resurrection ofNovorossiya, the historicRussian term forthe eastern partsofUkraine, aspart ofanewstate comprisingRussia, Ukraine andBelarus. Thismayseem like a delusion. Butthen so did hisﬁrstraid on the hospital inSlovianskthree yearsago.7MAKIS, a gym instructor, counted him-selfluckythree yearsago to land ajob in the publicsector. The 28-year-oldworksasa groundsman ata sportscom-plexin Glyfada, a seaside suburb ofAth-ens. Hired on a temporarycontract, he ex-pected to make a smooth transition to apermanentpostin local government. Buttimesare changing. Greece’sstate auditcouncil, which normallyrubber-stampsoﬃcial decisions, unexpectedlyruled thismonth thatmunicipal employeesshouldbe dismissed when theircontractsexpire.“That’sitforme, I’ll have to leave andﬁnd a job abroad like everyone else,” Ma-kissays, gesturingtowardshiscolleagues: aphalanxofstate employees, from rubbishcollectorsto computertechnicians. Theyare outside Athens’scityhall, protestingagainstthe auditcouncil’sdecision.More upheaval ison the way. On May18th parliamentapproved a newpackageofreformsdemanded bythe European Un-ion and the IMF, Greece’sbail-outcredi-tors. Sundayshoppingwill be extendedoutside touristareas, despite objections bysmall retailersclaimingtheywill be drivenoutofbusinessbylarge storesthatcan af-ford to hire the extra staﬀrequired. “Welobbied the politicianssuccessfullyforyearsto stop thishappening, butthe gameisover,” said Panos, who ownsa hardwareshop in central Athens.Passingthe measureswassupposed tounlockbail-outfundsfrom Greece’scredi-tors, which the governmentneedsto avoiddefaultingon bond paymentsofaround€7bn ($7.9bn) in July. Buta long-runningsquabble between Germanyand the IMFhascomplicated matters. The fund de-clined to join Greece’scurrentbail-out, itsthird, when itwassigned in 2015. NowWolfgangSchäuble, Germany’sﬁnanceminister, saysGermanywill notagree todisburse anymore bail-outmoneywith-outthe IMF’sparticipation in the pro-gramme—which isneeded, he thinks, tocounterthe softiesin the European Com-mission. MrSchäuble hasthe backingofsome othereuro-zone governments.Butthe IMFbelievesthatthe Euro-peans’ projectionsforthe Greekeconomyare too rosy, and thatGreece’sdebtwill beunsustainable unlessitgetsfurtherdefer-mentson payingitback. MrSchäuble iswaryofgrantingsuch debtreliefjustmonthsbefore Germany’selection in Sep-tember. So despite havingmetitscreditors’conditions, Greece isstuckin the middle oftheirrow. Ameetingin Brusselson May22nd failed to resolve the dispute. Oﬃcialson all sidesare conﬁdenta deal will bestruckin June.CriticsofAlexisTsipras, Greece’sprimeministerand leaderofthe left-wingSyrizaparty, sayhisgovernmenthassigned up toanotherﬁve yearsofausteritywithout se-curingthe debtreliefpromised bycreditorsin return. Worse, he isaccused ofbetrayinghisown voters. Whereaslastyear’sroundoftaxincreaseshitthe middle class hard-est, the newmeasureswill shrinkthe in-comesofpoorGreeks. Pensionshave beencuta dozen timessince 2010; another18%will be lopped oﬀin 2019. The tax-free al-lowance on incomeswill be slashed in2020 to bringGreece in line with its euro-zone partners. (More than halfofGreekspayno income taxatall, compared with8% forthe euro zone asa whole.)When Syriza sweptto powerin 2015, MrTsipraspromised to end austerityand re-store social beneﬁtscutbyprevious gov-ernments. Yethisfailure to do so hasprompted fewstrikesand streetprotests,compared with reformsbyearliergovern-ments. One reason isthattrade unions,which include manySyriza supporters,have been reluctantto defytheirfellowleftists. Butafterseven yearsofrecessionordinaryGreeksseem resigned to gettingbyon less. “It’shard to face the factthatyourpension’sgettingsmaller, butwhat todo?” shrugsConstantina, a retired teacher.Syriza oﬃcialsacceptthatvoters willpunish MrTsiprasatthe nextelection, duein 2019. The conservative NewDemocracyparty, led byKyriakosMitsotakis, a staunchreformist, holdsa double-digitlead overSyriza in opinion polls. Some Syriza mem-bershave even suggested thatthe primeministershould call an earlyelection andenjoya spell in opposition, stirring up trou-ble forthe conservativeswhile theystrug-gle to implementtough policiesalreadyagreed upon with the EUand IMF. MrTsipras’sstrategyisnotasMachia-vellian, saypartyinsiders. With the econ-omyforecastto growby1.8% thisyearand2.4% in 2018, he isbettingthatGreece canattractenough investmentto make a dentin unemployment, still the highestin theEUataround 23%. IfSyriza can win backenough votesto preventa conservativelandslide atthe 2019 election, its42-year-old leader’sfuture still looksbright. 7Greece’s debt odysseyNo reliefATHENS AND BRUSSELSThe governmentmeets creditors’ demands, butthere’s a catchFitful progressSource: Economist Intelligence Unit*ForecastGreece, GDP, % change on a year earlier201314151617*64202+–Not a fan of austerityThe EconomistMay27th2017 Europe43Optimism in FranceYes, oui canTHE French like to thinkofthemselvesasa miserable lot.

On May2nd BohuslavSobotka, theprime minister, threatened to resign unlessthe country’spresidentﬁred MrBabisoveraquestionable taxbreakhe received in2013. MrSobotka, a Social Democrat,hoped the attention to MrBabis’sﬁnanceswould stop hisown party’sheadlongslide.The ﬁnance ministereventuallyagreed tostep down. Butmore Czechsblamed MrSobotka forthe clash than MrBabis, and itseemsevermore likelythathe will win.Thatelection isone oftwo in the nexteightmonthsthatare pivotal to the CzechRepublic’sdirection.

Asthe west-ernmostformerSoviet-blocstate, theCzech RepublicstraddlesEurope’sgrow-ingdivide overliberal, pluralisticvalues,which Poland and Hungaryare challeng-ing. MrBabis, a pro-businesscentrist withno aﬀection forRussia, haslittle in com-mon ideologicallywith MrZeman, an eco-nomicleftist.

Ithasnot, admit-tedly, taken much to liftthe spirits: recklessextremists camesecond, notﬁrst, in electionsin Austria, the Netherlands andFrance; economicgrowth hasaccelerated beyond a snail’space;and Brexit, though probablydisastrousforBritain, may notbe cat-astrophicforEurope. Still, even the return ofnormality isa relieffora continentthathasspentthe pastfewyearsbattling crises. ButifEuropeanshave atlaststarted to feel betterabout them-selves, the world outside looksever-more menacing. The cher-ished European valuesofliberalism and respectforhuman rightsare beingchallenged bya cohortofunpredictable leaders whoseem notto prize orunderstand them. Thisisunsettling fortheEuropean Union, a slow-movingclub founded on reverence forthe rule oflaw. ForEuropeansthe shiftisembodied in three presi-dentswhose capriciousimpulsesare shapingand constrainingtheirforeign policy: Donald Trump, VladimirPutin and RecepTayyip Erdogan.Take MrTrump ﬁrst. Europeans’ fearsaboutthe Americanpresidenthave partlyeased since he tookoﬃce. MrTrump usedto enjoyeggingon anti-EUpoliticianslike Nigel Farage and Ma-rine Le Pen. However, aftermeetingvariousEuropean leaders, hehaslargelystopped doingso. In FebruaryMike Pence, the vice-president, reassured EurocratsthatAmerica wasnotbent on de-stroyingthe EU. European oﬃcials, aftervisitsto Washington, ex-pressoptimism thatsome ofMrTrump’smore outlandish court-iers, such asPeterNavarro, a trade adviserwho thinks America’sdeﬁcitsthreaten itssecurity, have lostthe president’sear.ButEuropeansare farfrom comfortable. “We have no ideawhere [the Americans] are on so manyissues,” saysa diplomat inBrussels, where MrTrump wasarrivingforan EUmeetingandNATO summitasThe Economistwentto press. Thatmeetingwasto be followed bya two-daysummitofthe G7 in Sicily. In therun-up to these encountersthe Europeanshunted forclarity onAmerica’sintentions, especiallyon climate and trade. During thecampaign, MrTrump vowed to withdrawfrom the Parisclimateaccord; he hasneitherreaﬃrmed norrevoked thatpledge. (Alertto his“America ﬁrst” approach to diplomacy, the Europeanshavedrawn up listsofAmerican jobsthatdepend on clean energy.)The Americanshave been reluctantto sign up to boilerplate lan-guage, in the G7 communiqué, on the importance ofglobal trade.IfMrTrump provokesquestionsforEuropeans, MrPutin chal-lengestheirassumptions. HisCrimean land grab upsetthe post-cold warorder, and histroopswreakhavocin Ukraine’seast.Weaknessmaylimitthe scale ofwhatMrPutin can accomplish.ButRussia’songoingdecline giveshim a reason to actnow ratherthan waitto disruptpro-European reformsin countriesthat heseesaswithin hissphere ofinﬂuence (although, happily, the EUhasatlastgranted Ukrainiansthe rightto visa-free travel). Insidethe EUMrPutin and hisproxiesmeddle in electionsand sponsorrabble-rousingpartiesand fake NGOs. Some governmentshavesetup disinformation unitsto counterRussian propaganda. MrErdogan isan even trickiercustomer. Turkeyisa NATOallyand a candidate foraccession to the EU. Itsintelligence can helpEuropeansﬁghtterrorism; ithostsmillionsofrefugeeswho mightotherwise seeksanctuaryin Europe. Butthe presidentis impossi-ble forEuropeansto deal with. He comparesEuropean govern-mentswho barhim from campaigningon theirterritoryto Nazis,and threatensto dump migrantson Bulgaria and Greece if hedoesnotgethisway. Hisdomesticpurgeshave nearlydestroyedTurkish democracy. Some Europeans, includingthe Austrian gov-ernment, wantto end Turkey’saccession talks. (Othersquietlyhope MrErdogan will end them himself.)Dealingwith anyone ofthistrio would be hard. Together theymake fora tetchyneighbourhood. UncertaintyoverAmerica’sapproach to Russia, forexample, magniﬁesthe threatfrom MrPu-tin. FearsthatMrTrump mightseeka grand bargain with theKremlin have faded, butGerman oﬃcialscannotcounton the co-operation overUkraine thattheyenjoyed in BarackObama’sday.Relationsamongthe three are unpredictable, too. In the past18monthsTurkeyhasshotdown a Russian plane, a Russian ambas-sadorhasbeen murdered in Ankara, Russia hasslapped sanc-tionson Turkeyand the two countrieshave made friends again. Combine the diﬃcultieswith Russia and Turkeywith ques-tion-marksoverAmerica’scommitmentto theirsecurity, andEuropeansare leftwith an acute sense of“geopolitical loneli-ness”, in the wordsofJan Techauofthe American Academy inBerlin, a think-tank. Thisalso unsettlesneighbouringregions inwhich the EU isused to exertinginﬂuence. The vacuum is feltinthe ex-Sovietstates, where American supportwasonce a given,butalso in the Western Balkans, a dangerouslyunstable zone inthe heartofEurope where America, Russia and Turkeyall vie forinﬂuence. Alone in a world so coldSome take a rosierview. European diplomatslike to say thatMrTrump’selection and Brexithave fostered a newfound sense ofcohesion in Europe. Surveysindeed ﬁnd supportforEU member-ship growingin mostcountries, and thisweekthe PewResearchCentre issued similarﬁndingsforNATO. Butitisa fragile sortofunity, grounded notin conﬁdence butin fearofthe outside world. Ata recentmeetingEUtrade councilmeeting, one diplomatnoteswith glee, the old splitsbetweenfree-tradersand protectionistshad gone; all were united behindprotective anti-dumpingmeasures. The wavesofmigrants thatpoured into Europe from Turkeyin 2015-16 sawa scramble to closeborders. And itisthe threatfrom MrPutin, more than any scold-ingtweetsfrom MrTrump, thathave spooked European govern-mentsinto raisingdefence spending.

Itwasa consciousdisplay ofunityin the face ofBritain’sdeadliestterro-ristattacksince July7th 2005. AsMancunianstookto the streets,counter-terrorism oﬃcerswere unpickingthe originsofthe plot. Latelytheyhaveworried aboutself-radicalised “lone wolf”attackers. In March Khalid Masood, a Brit-ish convertto Islam, murdered ﬁve peoplein Westminsterusingonlya rental car andakitchen knife. ButitseemsthatSalmanAbedi, a British-born 22-year-old ofLibyanstockwho detonated the bomb atthe Man-chesterArena, wasnotactingalone. Thatprompted Theresa Mayto raise theterroristthreatassessmentto itshighest,“critical” level forthe ﬁrsttime in ten years,indicatingthatan attackmaybe “immi-nent”. The prime minister’sannounce-menttriggered the deploymentofnearly1,000 troops, whose job isto secure sitessuch asthe HousesofParliamentand thusfree up police. AmberRudd, the home sec-retary, said the measure wastemporaryand would be keptunder“constantre-lyin Germanydaysbefore the attack.Police in Manchesterhave concludedthatthe explosive device he used was thedesign ofa skilled bomb-maker, too valu-able to expend on a suicide mission.Ithadaback-up meansofdetonation and seemsto have been similarin design to thoseused bytwo IS-inspired suicide-bombersin Brusselslastyear.Thatmuch isknown because photo-graphsofthe bomb’sbloodied fragmentswere leaked to the NewYorkTimes, pre-sumablybyAmerican intelligence ser-vices.

Butlike Masood, the West-minsterkiller, he had been regarded as alow-risk, peripheral ﬁgure.Some will question whyhe wasal-lowed to travel to Libya. Underrules intro-ducedin 2013, a person’spassportcan beconﬁscated on the basisoftheir“past, pre-sentorproposed activities, actual or sus-pected”. Itisa powerthatMrsMay, homesecretaryatthe time, said should be usedsparingly. The reason itwasnotused in thisinstance owesmore to the diﬃcultyMI5hasin keepingtabson up to 3,000 peoplewhom itregardsasreligiousextremists.The securityservicesare well funded(18 monthsago theyreceived the money totake on 1,900 employees, a 15% increase instaﬃng). But24-hoursurveillance isso la-bour-intensive thatonlyabout10% ofthe500 suspectsofreal concern can be con-stantlymonitored. Even then, there arestrictrulesabouthowlongsuch an opera-tion can be conducted ifityieldsnothing.Terrorism in Britain islessdeadly thanin the decadeswhen the Irish RepublicanArmy(IRA) wasactive (see charton previ-ouspage). Still,in the 18 monthsto Marchthisyearatleast12 terroristplotswere dis-rupted, accordingto DominicGrieve, whochairsthe parliamentaryIntelligence andSecurityCommittee. More have followed.Counter-terrorism oﬃcershave longworried aboutthe dangerposed byBritonsreturningfrom Syria, where about800wentto wage jihad. Manyhave been killed,butabouthalfare estimated to have re-turned.Ifthe quickeningtempo ofplots isanyindication, some are trained and hard-ened ﬁghterswith the skillsand motiva-tion to carryoutattacksathome.There isno evidence yetthatthe Man-chesterattackwastimed to disrupttheelection on June 8th. Britain hasno bigfar-rightpartythatmightbeneﬁtfrom a back-lash againstMuslims. The clownish Eng-lish Defence League staged a small demon-stration nearthe ManchesterArena, but itsmemberswere shouted down byan angryshopperand moved on bypolice.Thatisnotto saythere will be no im-pacton the election. MrsMay’sresponsewasnoticeablymore sure-footed than herrecentmanifesto launch (see Bagehot). BycontrastLabour’sleader, JeremyCorbyn,hasattended eventsin supportofthe IRAand described membersofHamasandHizbullahas“friends”. Pollshad shownthe Tories’ lead narrowing. Itisnotcynicalto suggestthatthe return ofterrorism willremind voterswhytheylike MrsMay. 7“NOTHINGhaschanged. Nothinghaschanged!” insisted Theresa May.Butithad. Fourdaysafterthe launch oftheConservatives’ manifesto on May18th, theprime ministerreversed itssignature poli-cy, a proposed reform ofthe fundingsys-tem forsocial care forthe elderly, whichhad come to be known asthe “dementiatax”. MrsMayinsisted thatthe change wasmerelya clariﬁcation. ButSirDavid Butler,anonagenarian psephologistatOxfordUniversity, noted on Twitterthatin the 20general-election campaignshe hasfol-lowed, “I can’tremembera U-turn on thisscale.” The about-face iswelcome, butleavesthe social-care system underfundedand hasfed a growingperception that themanifesto wasnotthoughtthrough.The Tories’ original plan wasto intro-duce a newfundingformula forsocial care,wherebyan elderlyperson would on theirdeath be liable forall oftheircare costs, un-til only£100,000 ($130,000) oftheirestateremained. (The state would coveranyfur-thercosts.) Thatishigherthan the existingthreshold, butincludesthe value oftheperson’shome, which the existingmeans-testdoesnotformostpeople.The policywasnotexpected to raisemuch money, butitwasprogressive:wealthyoldieswould end up contributingmost. Itearned itsunfortunate nicknamebecause itintroduced a bigdollop of blindluck. Asprightlyperson who died sudden-lymightbe able to passon millions, sincetheircare costswould be zero. Someoneunluckyenough to endure a longillnesswith complex, expensive needscould loseeverythingexcept£100,000. Fora govern-mentthathasresisted raisinginheritancetax, thiswasa strange inconsistency.MrsMay’semergency“clariﬁcation”helpsfend oﬀcriticism ofa health lottery.The newplan adoptsthe recommendationofa reviewin 2011bySirAndrewDilnottointroduce a cap on howmuch a personpaysforcare. (The manifesto had dis-missed hisproposalsas“mostlybeneﬁt-[ing] a small numberofwealthierpeople”.)SirAndrewsuggested a cap ofaround£40,000 in today’sprices. MrsMayhas notspeciﬁed a level.The higherthe cap, the lessthe state willhave to forkout. SirAndrew’sproposalmighthave costabout£2bn a year. GeorgeOsborne, the previouschancellor, hadpromised to implementa £72,000 capfrom 2020, ata costofaround halfthat. Inan era ofsqueezed publicspendingthetemptation will be to raise the cap to aneven higherlevel. The introduction ofa cap notonly pro-tectsthe unluckyfewfrom exorbitant carecosts. Italso limitsthe liabilities ofprivateinsurers, makingitmore attractive forthem to coversocial care. Atpresent, themarketforsocial-care insurance istiny. Ifitwere to develop, elderlyfolkwould worrylessaboutfundingtheircare costsout oftheirestate.Yetthere isreason to be sceptical thatsuch a marketwill bloom. British insur-ance companieshave watched Americanﬁrmsgettheirﬁngersburntasconditionslike dementia have become more com-mon. Despite the ageingpopulation, by2014 salesoflong-term care insurance inAmerica were two-thirdslowerthan theyhad been in the early2000s. Itisalso anopen question whether, underthe newrules, elderlyBritonswould be all that in-terested in private insurance. With the costofcare to be capped and no one needing topayanythinguntil theydie, would manybothertakingouta policy? Followingthe tweak, the Conserva-tives’ plan forsocial care lookssimilar towhatwasalreadylegislated forbefore themanifesto waslaunched, pointsoutSir An-drew: a cap on costs, plusa meanstest.Thisdoeslittle to addressthe fundingshortfallfaced bysocial care. Between 2009 and2019, fundingperperson isexpected toshrinkbyaround 5% in real terms. The social-care proposal isnotthe onlypartofthe manifesto which looksa bithalf-baked. There isno detail on the extentofproposed cutsto winter-fuel allowance,which are supposed to fund social care.The manifesto issilenton plansforincometax(mostpeople suspectthatincreases areon the way). And there isno acknowledg-mentthatthe pledge to cutnetmigrationbynearlytwo-thirdswould have bigﬁscalcosts.

The third isthatthese two reinforce each other: the fur-thershe movesinto unfamiliarterritory, the more dysfunctionalherapproach becomes.MrsMayperfected herstyle duringsixgrindingyears attheHome Oﬃce. She became the empressofherbrief. Both friendsand enemiesdescribe herasa dogged workerwith almost nosmall talk. She relied on two ferociouslyloyal special advisers,NickTimothyand Fiona Hill. She foughthercorneragainst cabi-netcolleagueswho eitherdismissed herasa dullard or, asshestuckaround foryears, feared herasa rival. Thisapproach broughtsigniﬁcantsuccesses. MrsMayshowedcivil servantswho wasboss—no mean achievementin a hugeand lethargicbureaucracy—and tookon vested interestssuch asthe police. Butitalso produced signiﬁcantfailures. She ignoredappealsbyhercabinetcolleaguesto relaxa clampdown on for-eign students, despite the damage thatherpolicywasdoing tohighereducation, an area where Britain excels.ItishardlysurprisingthatMrsMayapplied the formula thathad keptheron top ofthe Home Oﬃce forso longwhen she be-came prime minister. She installed MrTimothyand MsHill asherco-chiefsofstaﬀand centralised control ofall decision-making.Buton hernewterritory, much largerand lessfamiliar, the ratio offailuresto successeshasworsened. The bestleadersbring togeth-erpeople with diﬀerentstrengths. MrsMay’steam bringstogeth-erpeople with exactlythe same weaknesses. Two vulnerabilitiesare particularlyworrying: a profound ignorance ofeconomics(MrsMayhasn’thad to soil herhandswith anybusiness-relatedsubjectssince she brieﬂyworked atthe BankofEngland in 1977-83) and a preoccupation with internal partypolitics. MrTimothyin particularisobsessed with refashioningthe Toriesas a moreblue-collarparty. Issueswith far-reachingeconomicconse-quences, such asmigration, are too often treated asproblems oflawand orderoropportunitiesto reposition the party.The dangersofthisapproach were apparentin MrsMay’sU-turn oversocial care. The Toryparty’smanifesto tried to tackletwo ofBritain’sbiggestproblems—the risingcostoflooking afterelderlypeople and the concentration ofwealth in the hands ofthe old—with an audacioussuggestion: whynotgetoldsters tofund more ofthe costsofcare themselves? Butitignored crucialdetailssuch asputtinga cap on costs. Lookingaftersomeone withdementia can wipe outeven a prosperousfamily. SirAndrew Dil-nothasdiscussed thissubjectin an exhaustive government re-porton social care. Cabinetministerssuch asJeremyHunt, thehealth secretary, have grappled with the problem foryears.

Two monthsago MrsMayaban-doned a budgetproposal to raise national insurance contribu-tionsforself-employed workersbecause she and herteam hadfailed to spotthatitclashed with one ofDavid Cameron’smani-festo commitments. She remainsobsessed byreducingannualnetmigration to “tensofthousands” (from a currentlevel ofabout250,000) despite the factthatnone ofhercabinet col-leagues, letalone independentexperts, thinkitachievable.

The trend masksafrenzyofregional change. South Ameri-ca, South-EastAsia and the Middle Easthave seen sharp increasesin prisonernumbers(145%, 75% and 75%). In Europenumbershave fallen by21%.Overthe sameperiod, crime hasfallen worldwide.Manyjailsare hellish; sometimes delib-eratelyso. In Syrian prisons, dissidents arebeaten, given electricshocks, crushed in afoldingboard called the “ﬂyingcarpet” andhanged in theirthousandsaftertwo-mi-nute “trials”. More commonly, prisonsarevile because theyare overcrowded and ill-managed, so the nastierinmates(andguards) can do whattheyplease.

Atone prison in Manaus,severed headsand limbswere stacked onthe ﬂoor.Worldwide, overcrowdingisthe norm.Prisonscostmoneyto build, afterall, andthere are fewvotesto be won bymakinglife easierforcriminals. In 58% ofthe 198countriesforwhich there are data, prisonsare more than 100% full, saysthe latest an-nual Global Prison Trendsreportfrom Pe-nal Reform International, a think-tank.Some 40% ofcountrieswere above 120%capacity; 26% were above 150%.America locksup farmore people thananyotherrich country(see chart1). Yettherecenttrend hasbeen towardsleniency.The proportion ofAmerican adultsbehindbarsfell from a peakof1in 100 in 2008 to 1in 115 in 2015. Several stateshave tried toﬁnd alternativesto incarceration for non-violentcriminals, partlyto save moneyand partlybecause theyhave concludedthatlockingup too manypeople fortoolongdoeslittle forpublicsafety. “Kentuckyprisonswere full ofpeople we’re mad at,notpeople we’re afraid of,” saysJohn Til-ley, the secretaryofjustice in Kentucky. On the straightand narrowDonald Trump’sattorney-general, Jeﬀ Ses-sions, wantsto make America more puni-tive again. Thismonth he ordered federalprosecutorsto seekmaximum sentencesfordrugoﬀenders. Although federal in-matesare lessthan a tenth ofthe total inAmerica, MrSessionsshowsthatadvo-catesofold-fashioned “tough-on-crime”policiesare still powerful. One reason forlockingpeople up is topunish them. Victimsofcrime, especially,maybe comforted bythe knowledge thattheirtormentorsare suﬀering. In a poll incrime-racked Brazil, 57% ofpeople agreedthat“a good criminal isa dead criminal.”Butformanypeople the aim ofincar-ceration isto reduce the harm caused bycriminals. Prisonscan do thisin threeways. First, theyrestrain: a thugbehindbarscannotbreakinto yourhouse. Second,theydeter: the prospectofbeinglocked upmakespotential wrongdoersthinktwice.Third, theyreform: understate supervi-sion, a criminal can be taughtbetter habits. On the ﬁrstcount, mostprisonssuc-ceed, butata cost. The massincarcerationofcertain groupsofmen, such asblackAmericans, can tearapartfamiliesandcommunities. And manycriminalsarekeptlocked up longpastthe age atwhichtheycease to pose much ofa riskto thepublic. Violence isa youngman’svice;there are notmanymiddle-aged muggers. On the second count, deterrence, pri-sonsare necessaryunlesswe wantto bringbackﬂogging. Butsentencesneed not be aslongastheyare in manycountries, espe-ciallyAmerica. Criminalshave shorttimehorizons—a ten-yearsentence onlydetersthem slightlymore than a one-yearsen-tence, though itcoststen timesasmuch. Todeterwould-be criminals, whatmattersmostisnotthe severityofthe penalty butthe certaintyand swiftnesswith which itisimposed.Criminalsrestrain themselvesonlyiftheythinktheywill be caught andpunished. Steven Levitt, an economist, es-timatesthatin America $1spenton policeisatleast20% more eﬀective in preventingcrime than $1spenton prisons.Even when the police are eﬀective,criminalsare often undeterred.

Which iswhyrehabilitation isso important: nearlyall inmateswill eventuallybe released,and itisfarbetterforeveryone ifthey donotgo backto theirold ways.

Itgoesthe otherway,” saysRonGordon ofthe Utah Commission on Crim-inal and Juvenile Justice, a state body. Modern electronictagsare cheap andeﬀective. In a recentstudyRafael Di Tella ofHarvard Universityand Ernesto Schar-grodskyofTorcuato Di Tella Universitycompared the eﬀectsofelectronictaggingversusprison foralleged oﬀendersin Bue-nosAires. Earlierresearch had failed todeal with the factthatcriminalswho aretagged are lesslikelyto reoﬀend than themore dangerousoneswho are locked up.The authorsfound a wayround this. Al-leged criminalsin Argentina are assignedrandomlyto judgesforpre-trial hearings.Liberal judgesare reluctantto hold them inthe country’sawful jails, so theyoften or-derthem to be tagged. So-called mano dura(tough hand) judgespreferto lockthem up.The researchersobserved whathappenedto similaroﬀendersunderdiﬀerentre-gimes. Only13% ofthose who were taggedwere laterrearrested; forthose sent to pri-son the ﬁgure was22%.Prison breakSome criminalsare so dangerousthattheyneed to be locked up. Butnearlyall willone daybe released. ConsiderTore (not hisreal name), an inmate atBastoy. He spenthis20ssellingdrugs, drinkingand party-ing. One day, when he washigh on meth-amphetamine and had notsleptforthreedays, he attacked two friendswith a knife,overnothing—some expensive clothes. Hewasarrested, charged and gotinto anotherﬁghtwhile awaitingtrial. He waseventual-lygiven a 14-yearsentence forthree at-tempted murdersand intendingto sell sev-eral kilosofhash. Forthe ﬁrstcouple ofyearsinside aclosed prison, he wasfuriousand blamed“everyone else” forhisplight, he says. Butthen he tooka course with a counsellorwho had lived “the same life”. She talkedto him abouthisregretforwhathe haddone, and persuaded him thathe couldnevertouch alcohol again. Ittookmanymonths. “Itwaslike freedom,” he recalls. AtBastoyhe tooka carpentryexam. Hewill probablybe released in three years.On thatday, he expectsto have a job. Bas-toyinmatescan startworkingoutside 18monthsbefore theyare released—the aimisto ensure thateveryex-prisonerhas aroof, an income and somethingto do. (InAmerica some prisonersare released afterlongsentenceswith little more thanclothesand a busfare.) EventuallyToreplansto setup hisown carpentrybusiness. Prisonsaround the world use a varietyoftoolsto preventrecidivism. Itis ﬁendish-lyhard to disentangle whatinﬂuences aconvict’sfuture behaviour, butAdam Gelbofthe PewCharitable Trusts, a think-tank,laysoutsome principleswhich have beenshown to work. First, identifythe inmateswho are mostlikelyto reoﬀend. Some good predictors ofthiscannotbe changed, such asa troubledfamilybackground and previouscriminalhistory. Age isalso crucial—some 68% offederal prisonersin America who are re-leased before the age of21are rearrestedwithin 8 years; forthe over-60s, itisonly16%. Otherriskfactorsare more malleable.Poorimpulse control, substance abuse andthe habitofpickinganti-social friends canall respond to treatment.Rehabilitation programmesthatfocuson factorsotherthan crime, such ascre-ative abilities, physical conditioning andself-esteem do notreduce criminal behav-iour, arguesEdward Latessa ofthe Univer-sityofCincinnati. Bootcampsare especial-lyineﬀective: theyfosteraggression andbond criminalstogether.OliverBueno, a formerdrug-dealer,agrees. “I came outworse,” he recallsof histime in a juvenile bootcamp in Nevada.“Yougotbeatup all the time bystaﬀ,” hesays, addingthatthe guardswere “ex-mili-tary, hillbilliesand real racists”. He de-scribeshavinghishead shaved and beingconstantlyshouted at. “The abuse gotmemore and more angry, hatingauthority,”he says. Afterhisrelease, he wentstraightbackto gangbanging, sellingdrugsand get-tinginto ﬁghtsovertrivial slights. Shortlybefore hisnextarrest, he says, “I had a gunin [anotherman’s] face and I don’teven re-memberwhatitwasabout.” Perhapsthe besttool iscognitive behav-ioural therapy(CBT). Thisisnotabout sit-tingin a circle and sharingone’sinnerde-mons. Itisabouthelpingpeople tounderstand the “triggers”—people, placesand things—thatpromptthem to oﬀend.The counsellornudgesthe oﬀenderto-wardsminimisingnegative inﬂuencesandmaximisingpositive ones.

There wasmixed evidence forthe eﬀecton sexof-fenders, who are hard to reform. The greatescapeMrBueno, the formerdrug-dealer, says hewasreformed notbyanythinghe learnedin prison, butbyHope forPrisoners, a char-ity—and God.

An attention to coststhatisuncommonin the startup world isalso payingoﬀhandsomely. In 2015 Airbnb hired asitschiefﬁnancial oﬃcerLaurence Tosi, whohad previouslydone the same job atBlack-stone, a private-equityﬁrm. He isregardedasthe adultsupervision.

Rental healthAirbnb’sfounderswere earlyto recognisethe importance ofa strong, benign culture.(Uber, meanwhile, isunderﬁre forits hard-chargingpractices.) Until 2013 the foundersinterviewed everyjob applicant, and to-dayanyone who ishired still hasto pass a“core values” interview, where theyarejudged noton theirCV buton howtheyﬁtinto the ﬁrm’ssensibility. Thisensures thatpeople have a sense ofmission, even ifsome ofthe ﬁrm’speppyidealism soundsnaive to jaded journalists.

Given itsﬁnancialresults, MrCheskymaintainsthat“wedon’tneed to raise anymore moneyeveragain.” Butthe hiringofMrTosi and thepush forﬁnancial discipline suggests theﬁrm doeswantto go public, perhapsassoon as2018.

Airbnb’sfoundersstarted ascompleteoutsidersto the hospitalitybusiness andindeed, to commerce. Brian Chesky, its 35-year-old chiefexecutive, had no previousbusinessexperience ortechnical expertise.Instead, he and one ofhisco-founders, JoeGebbia, had studied design atRhode Is-land School ofDesign before teamingupwith a software engineer, Nathan Ble-charczyk, to launch whatwasthen calledAirBed and Breakfast, with the aim of rent-ingoutairmattressesin apartments. Theywere so untutored in investingthatwhenan earlyadvisersuggested raisingmoneyfrom small investorsknown as“angels”,MrCheskythoughtpeople in Silicon Val-leybelieved in celestial beings. Both Airbnb and Uber—America’stwomostvaluable “unicorns”, private startupsworth over$1bn—operate platformswith-outowningthe underlyingroomsand carsthatare beingused; both take a cutfrom ev-erytransaction.

Eitherway, the rivalrybetween Airbnband hotelswill surelyintensify. An analy-sisbyMorgan Stanley, a bank, suggests thatthe numberofovernightstaysin Airbnbaccommodation will reach 6% ofall hotelnightsin America and Europe by2018, upfrom 4% in 2016.

Thathasdrawn the attention ofothers. In manymarkets, includingChina and Europe,Airbnb facescompetition from local ﬁrms,aswell asfrom established global players.In 2015 Expedia, an online-travel website,boughtHomeAway, an Airbnb rival, for ahefty$3.9bn. ButAirbnb’smostfearsome competitorisPriceline, which ownsBooking.com andisconsidered one ofthe best-managed in-ternetcompaniesin the world. Pricelinehasbeen speedilyaddingalternative ac-commodation. MrCheskyinsiststhat“there isfundamentallynota lotofoverlapbetween whatthey’re oﬀeringand whatwe’re oﬀering”, because Priceline iswork-ingmostlywith property-managementcompaniesthat“lookmore like hotels”.Butthiswill be lesstrue overtime.

Thisishelped alongbychemicals—lotsofthem,conﬁdesa winemakerbased nearthetown ofThuirin the Pyrenees. In their ab-sence, vineyardswould need natural fertil-isersand to be weeded byhand, both cost-ly. French farmersuse more chemicals thananyone else in Europe: 65,000 tonnesofpesticidesalone each year. Even the smallestofvine-growers hasan interestin a seriesoftakeoverspro-posed between theirchemicalssuppliers.Aftera decade withoutanybigdeals, since2015 three mega-mergers, collectivelyworth around $240bn, have been pro-posed. When theywere ﬁrstannounced,manydoubted thatregulatorswould al-lowthe mergersbecause ofcompetitionworries. Ifall three proceed, asnow seemslikely, fourcompanieswill produce 70% ofthe world’spesticidesinstead ofsixtoday. The ﬁrstmega-merger, announced inDecember2015, wasbetween DowChemi-cal and DuPont, the world’sfourth andﬁfth mostvaluable chemicalsﬁrms, in a$130bn deal. Itwasthe largest-evertie-up inthe industry, and triggered otherliaisons.Within a yearBayer, a German agrichemi-calsgiant, agreed to merge with Monsanto,an American seedmaker, in a deal worth$66bn; and ChemChina, a Chinese giant,oﬀered $43bn in cash forSyngenta, a Swissbiotech ﬁrm. ChemChina plansto mergewith a local rival, Sinochem, to create aﬁrm with revenuesof$100bn orso.Dealmakinghasnowspread from agri-chemicalsto the restofthe industry, partic-ularlyto “specialty” ﬁrmsthatmake chem-icalsforniche uses. On May22nd Clariantand Huntsman, whose productsincludeadditivesforpesticides, agreed a $14bnmergerofequals. Biggerstill isthe latestbidbyPPG ofAmerica, a specialtymakerofpaintsand coatings, forAkzoNobel of theNetherlands, a rival which ownsDuluxpaint. On May24th, Praxairand Linde, twoindustrial-gasﬁrms, agreed the terms ofamergerofequalsworth $70bn.The main impetushasbeen a dramaticslowdown in the growth ofdemand acrossall typesofchemicals, saysP.J. Juvekar ofCitigroup, a bank. In the 2000ssalesex-panded ata rate of6-7% a year, butlastyearthe industrygrewbyjust2%, with demandfrom China veryweak. Executivesare hop-ingto use scale to cutcosts.The soaringcostofdevelopingand test-ingnewchemicalsisanotherfactor, saysKurtBock, CEO ofBASF, a German chemi-calsgiant. The average costofdeveloping anewactive substance hasshotup from$150m in 1995 to over$500m in Europe to-day; mostofthatgoeson testingfor safety.Overthe same period, the numberofpo-tential compoundsthathave to be synthe-sised and tested foreach newsubstance, incase theyare harmful, hasrisen from50,000 to over140,000, a processthatcantake aslongasa decade. To accountfor lon-gerand more costlydevelopmentcycles,ﬁrmsneed enough ﬁnancial heftto be ableto have more projectson the go.More stringentregulation throughoutthe EUhasreduced the numberofpesti-cidesfarmersare permitted to use, fromnearly1,000 in the early1990sto around400 today, notesRobertde GraeﬀoftheEuropean Landowners’ Organisation, atrade group. Ifgreaterscale meansthatﬁrmsfeel able to investthe largersums ofmoneyneeded to develop newproducts,hismemberswould approve. Butfarmersare also fearful. They don’twantto become overdependenton a set ofseedsand chemicalsmade bya single ﬁrm.All three ofthe mega-mergersare betweenone ﬁrm focused on seedsand another onagrichemicals. Manyfarmersare worriedthiswill mean theywill be forced to usepesticidesmade bythe same ﬁrm that pro-ducesthe seedstheybuy. RogerJohnson,presidentofAmerica’sNational FarmersUnion, saysthathismembersdon’tlikeanyofthe mergers. More consolidationmayalso mean thatchemical ﬁrmscancharge higherprices, he fears, and face lesspressure to develop newproducts. Butall the dealsshould passregulators.TheEUhassigned oﬀon the Dow-DuPontand ChemChina-Syngenta deals; itisnowalmostcertain thatthe dealswill gothrough, saysMrJuvekar. Bayerisin talkswith regulatorsaboutMonsanto; analystsagain reckon thata deal will proceed.Regulators’ relaxed stance islikely tostimulate still more activity. The ease withwhich ChemChina’spurchase ofSyngentawasapproved mayembolden more Chi-nese ﬁrmsto go forWestern chemical com-paniesin the future. The currentseries ofdeals—though huge—lookslike the start ofabiggerwave, saysFlorian Budde ofMcKinsey, a consultancy. Farmersare like-lyto have more to worryabout. 7The chemicals industryChain reactionTo farmers’ chagrin, deal mania hasseized the chemicals business Clariﬁcation:In the issue of May 20th Schumpeterreferred to staﬀ turnover at Dow Chemical.

One wayto categorisethem isto splitthem into two types: polishersand pickers.Polishersputtheirenergyinto products, improvingand reima-giningtheirdesign and production in a questforperfection. LongafterApple had become one ofthe planet’smostvaluable ﬁrms,itsboss, Steve Jobs(who died in 2011), obsessed over“the ﬁnishon a piece ofmetal, the curve ofthe head ofa screw, the shade ofblue on a box”, writeshisbiographer, WalterIsaacson.Pickers, bycontrast, are capital allocators, who stand backanddecide unsentimentallyhowthe ﬁrm should deployresources.An example ofthisapproach isJeﬀImmelt, who runsGeneralElectric(GE), the world’smostvaluable industrial ﬁrm. Mr Im-melt’srecord since takingoverin 2001showsthatcapital alloca-tion isfarharderthan youmightthink.Mostchiefexecutiveswould saytheyare more pickers thanpolishers. The taskofcreatingthe iPhone, devisinga new drugorhoninga manufacturingprocessisbestleftto geniuses such asMrJobsorto internal experts. Bycontrastcapital allocation happensto a CEO, like itornot. Considera ﬁrm thatreinvests10% ofitsnetworth everyyear. Bytheirtenth yearin charge the CEO’schoicesaboutdeployingcash—includinga decision to justsleepwalk—will explain 60% ofthe ﬁrm’sbookvalue.Takingﬁrm control ofthe processmakesobvioussense. In the1970sthe logicofstarvinglousybusinessesand feedinggoodoneswasspread bymanagement-consultingﬁrms.

Todaythe consultancyreckonsthatbusinessesshiftbetween the buck-etstwice asfastastheydid in the 1990s.MrImmelthasremade GEpartlybecause he had a trickyin-heritance. GE’sshareswere overvalued, itsearningswere inﬂatedbygainsfrom itspension scheme, and ithad overexpanded itsﬁ-nancial arm, which laterblewup duringthe bankingcrisis. Hehasglobalised GE: 57% ofsalesnowcome from abroad, up from29% in 2001. And he hasloosened up itsculture. Itsold head oﬃce,in Connecticut, satamid suburbsand golfcourses. Itsnew digsinBoston are nextto an artinstitute.Butthe main legacyofMrImmeltwill be asa capital allocator.He hasshrunkorsold businessesthatare mature orunder mar-gin pressure, such asplasticsand kitchen appliances, or where GEhasno advantage, such asmedia. He haskilled oﬀmost ofitsﬁ-nancial arm. And he hasboughtin areaswith promisinggrowthstorieswhere tech isbecomingmore important, such asaviation,powersystemsand medical devices. The scale ofchange hasbeen huge. Outside the ﬁnancial arm, lookingjustatindustrialoperations, since 2001GEhastraded businessesworth $126bn, or167% ofthe capital employed in itsindustrial divisions. Countingcapital expenditures, too, MrImmelthasredirected resourcesworth a colossal 227% ofGE’scapital base.The resultsare lessimpressive than youmightexpect. Annualfree cashﬂowfrom GE’sindustrial businesswasaround $10bn in2001and the ﬁgure hasnotrisen even asitscapital employed hasincreased from below$30bn to $75bn (see chart). Cash returns oncapital have fallen to about12%. Partlyreﬂectingthis, GE’sshareshave lagged behind the S&P500 indexovermostperiods.Whydoesa logical strategy, methodicallyimplemented bycompetentpeople, notsucceed better? Active capital allocationcarriesa danger: itcan be procyclical, magnifyingthe swingsinsentimentthatmostindustriesface. Businessesthatare perform-ingwell often have proﬁtsthatare atcyclical highsand thatarevalued atinﬂated levels. AsWarren Buﬀettputsit, “Whatissmartatone price isdumb atanother.”In “The Outsiders”, a cultbusinessbook, William Thorndikestudieseightbosseswhose ﬁrmson average have outpaced theS&P500 bya factorof20. Theymayhave been obsessed withcapital allocation, buttheyboughtinto deeplyunfashionablethings, from decrepitcable-TVnetworksin rural America (JohnMalone atTCI), to the makersofTwinkies(Bill Stiritzat RalstonPurina). Buckingaccepted wisdom is, however, extraordinarilyhard forCEOsofbig, iconicﬁrms, who mustbuilta consensusamongexecutives, directorsand shareholders.Spitand polishThe costofchurningcapital in predictable wayscan be signiﬁ-cant. SchumpeterestimatesthatGEhaspaid a multiple of13 timesgrossoperatingproﬁtsforthe businessesithasbought and got9timesforthose itsold. Some nine-tenthsofitsindustrial capital isnowcomprised ofgoodwill, orthe premium thata ﬁrm paidabove bookvalue foritsacquisitions. Acompany’scapital expen-diture can also be procyclical.

Dealsare often a zero-sum game.

Butin doingso, theyare bothchangingthe marketsand the wayaca-demicsunderstand them.The idea thatﬁnancial marketsare “eﬃ-cient” became widespread amongaca-demicsin the 1960sand 1970s. The hypoth-esisstated thatall information relevant toan asset’svalue would instantlybe reﬂect-ed in the price; little point, therefore, intradingon the basisofsuch data. Whatwould move the price would be future in-formation (news) which, bydeﬁnition,could notbe known in advance. Sharepriceswould followa “random walk”. In-deed, a bookcalled “ARandom WalkDown Wall Street” became a bestseller.The idea helped inspire the creation ofindex-trackers—fundsthatsimplybuyallthe sharesin a benchmarklike the S&P500.From small beginningsin the 1970s, track-ershave been steadilygainingmarketshare. Theycommand around 20% ofallassetsundermanagementtoday.Butthe eﬃcient-markethypothesis hasrepeatedlybeen challenged. When theAmerican stockmarketfell by23% in a sin-gle dayin October1987, itwashard to ﬁnd areason whyinvestorsshould haveest-rate diﬀerential between two countriesreﬂectsthe expected change in exchangerates. In eﬀect, thismeantthatthe forwardrate in the currencymarketwasthe bestpredictorofexchange-rate movements. MrWadhwani wassurprised bythis ap-proach, since he knewmanypeople whoused the “carrytrade”, ie, borrowingmon-eyin a low-yieldingcurrencyand invest-ingin a higher-yieldingone. Ifthe bankwasright, such a trade should be unproﬁt-able. Aftersome debate, the bankagreedon a classicBritish compromise: itforecastthe currencywould move halfthe distanceimplied byforward rates.Manywho workin ﬁnance still believetheycan beatthe market. Afterall, therewasa potential ﬂawatthe heartofthe eﬃ-cient-markettheory.

One example isthe mo-mentum eﬀect: sharesthathave outper-formed the marketin the recentpastcontinue to do so. Anotheristhe “low-vo-latility” eﬀect: sharesthatmove less viol-entlythan the marketproduce betterrisk-adjusted returnsthan theorypredicts. Anewbreed offunds, known in the jar-gon as“smartbeta”, have emerged to ex-ploitthese anomalies. In a sense thesefundsare simplytryingto mimic, in a sys-tematicway, the methodsused bytradi-tional fund managerswho interviewexec-utivesand pore overbalance-sheetsin anattemptto pickoutperformingstocks. Whetherthese fundswill prosperde-pendson whythe anomalieshave beenproﬁtable in the past. There are three pos-sibilities. The ﬁrstisthatthe anomalies arestatistical quirks; interrogate the data forlongenough and youmayﬁnd thatstocksoutperform on wetMondaysin April. Thatdoesnotmean theywill continue to do so. The second possibilityisthatthe excessreturnsare compensation forrisk. Smallercompaniescan deliveroutsize returns buttheirsharesare lessliquid, and thus morediﬃcultto sell when youneed to; the ﬁrmsare also more likelyto go bust. Two aca-demics, Eugene Fama and Kenneth French,have argued thatmostanomaliescan beexplained bythree factors: a company’ssize; itsprice relative to itsassets (the valueeﬀect); and itsvolatility. The third possibilityisthatthe returnsreﬂectsome quirkofbehaviour. The out-size returnsofmomentum stocksmayhave been because investorswere slow torealise thata company’sfortuneshad im-proved. Butbehaviourcan change; MrWadhwani saysshare pricesare movingmore on the dayofearningsannounce-ments, relative to subsequentdays, thantheywere 20 yearsago. In otherwords, in-vestorsare reactingfaster. The carry trade WHATisthe pointofbuyingshares?Ultimatelyinvestorsmusthope thatthe cash theyreceive from the companywill oﬀeran attractive long-term return.Overthe longrun, reinvested divi-dendsratherthan capital gainshave com-prised the vastbulkofreturns. But sincethe 1980sAmerican ﬁrmshave increas-inglyused share buy-backs, which havetaxadvantagesforsome investors. Buy-backshave been higherthan dividendpaymentsin eightofthe pastten years.In a buy-back, investorsreceive cashfora proportion oftheirholdings. Anewpaper* in the Financial AnalystsJournalarguesthataddingthisto dividend re-ceiptsto calculate a total payoutyieldgivesa betterestimate offuture returnsthan the dividend yield alone. Italso re-vealsa much bettermatch between stock-marketperformance and overall eco-nomicgrowth.Usingdata goingbackto 1871, the au-thorsﬁnd thatthe average dividend yieldhasbeen 4.5% and the total payoutyield4.89%. Since 1970 the dividend yield hasdropped to 3.03%, butthe total payoutyield hasaveraged 4.26%. Looked atonthatbasis, the overall income return fromshareshasbeen notthatfarbelowhistori-cal levels. The return from sharescan be brokendown into three components: the initialincome yield; growth in the incomestream; and anychange in valuation. (Ifsharesbecome more expensive, the yieldwill fall. Saythe dividend is$6 and theshare price is$100, the initial yield will be6%. Ifthe sharesrise to $120, the yield willfall to 5% butthe investorswill have madeacapital gain.) Overthe longrun, changesin valua-tion levelsdo notmake much diﬀerenceto the return. Whathasdriven stockmark-etreturnsin recentdecadesisthat totalpayoutshave grown fasterthan before.The growth rate since 1871hasbeen 2.05%;since 1970, ithasbeen 3.44%. Thatisproba-blybecause ofstrongcorporate proﬁts,which recentlyhita post-1945 high asa pro-portion ofAmerica’sGDP. An obviousapparentdiﬀerence be-tween dividendsand buy-backsisthat ev-eryshareholdergetsthe dividend but notall ofthem tend to take partin a buy-back.Buttheorysuggestsinvestorsshould gainfrom a share buy-backeven iftheydo nottake part. The buy-backwill reduce thenumberofsharesin issue, givingexistinginvestorsa proportionatelylargerclaim onthe proﬁtsand assetsofthe company.Overtime, buy-backsare oﬀsetby thesharescompaniesissue to make acquisi-tionsand honourexecutive share-optionschemes. In the halfcenturysince 1970newshare issuance hasexceeded buy-backs. Butin the ten yearsto 2014, on aver-age, buy-backshave predominated.The authorsalso experimentwith us-ingthe total payoutyield asa yardstick ofwhetherstocksare dearorcheap. Byaver-agingthe yield overten years, theyworkoutthe cyclically-adjusted total yield(CATY) and compare itwith the cyclically-adjusted price-earningsratio (CAPE),which averagescorporate proﬁts. Theyﬁnd thatCATYisatleastasgood asCAPEin predictingmarketmovements. Asforthe linkwith economicgrowth,itisoften hard to ﬁnd a short-term correla-tion between thisand stockmarketper-formance, which tendsto be much morevolatile. Butthe authorsfound that, overthe verylongrun, growth in the aggregatepayoutfrom American equitieshasmatched thatofthe country’sGDP(seechart), and payout-per-share growth hasmatched thatofGDPperhead. There isno guarantee thatthisrela-tionship will continue. Payoutslagged alongwaybehind GDPin the second halfofthe 20th century, and have onlycaughtup because ofthe surge in buy-backs. Andthe stockmarketismuch more interna-tional than itused to be; almosthalf therevenuesofS&P500 companiescomefrom outside America. Focusingon total payoutsallowstheauthorsto be a bitmore optimistic in theirforecastsoffuture returnsthan the tradi-tional dividend-based approach wouldsuggest. Historically, total payouts havegrown byaround 1.67% peryear, com-pared with 1.46% fordividendsalone.Combine thatwith the currentpayoutyield and yougetan expected future realreturn of5.1%, compared with just3.6% ifdividendsalone are used. Whethereventhatreturn, however, would be enough tomeetdeﬁned-beneﬁtpension promises,particularlythose made to theirworkersbystate and local governmentsin Ameri-ca, isanotherquestion.

MrIlmanen saysitislikelythatreturns fromsmart-beta factorswill be lower, now thatthe strategiesare more popular.Ifmarketsare changing, so too are theacademicswho studythem. Manymod-ern research papersfocuson anomalies oron behavioural quirksthatmightcause in-vestorsto make apparentlyirrational deci-sions. The adaptive-marketshypothesis,devised byAndrewLo ofthe Massachu-settsInstitute ofTechnology, suggests thatthe marketdevelopsin a mannerakin toevolution. Tradersand fund managerspur-sue strategiestheybelieve will be proﬁt-able; those thatare successful keep going;those thatlose money, drop out. The resultscan be dramatic. In August2007 there wasa “quantquake” ascomput-erised strategiesbrieﬂystopped working;the suspicion wasthatone managerwasoﬄoadinghispositionsaftertaking lossesin the mortgage market. The episode hint-ed ata dangerofthe quantapproach: ifcomputersare all churningoverthe samedata, theymaybe buyingthe same shares.Atthe momentAmerican growth stocks,such astechnologycompanies, are asex-pensive, relative to global value stocks, astheywere duringthe dotcom bubble (seecharton previouspage). Whatifthe trendchanges? No mathematical formula, how-everclever, can ﬁnd a buyerfora trader’spositionswhen everyone ispanicking. 7Noble GroupDamsel in distressTHE diﬃcultiesfacingNoble Group, abeleaguered HongKongcommoditiestrader, are multiplying. On May23rd theﬁrm wasforced to suspend tradingof itssharesin Singapore aftertheirvalueslumped bymore than 28% in halfanhour. The panicked sellingcame afterS&PGlobal, a ratingsagency, warned thatNoble wasatriskofdefaultingon largedebtrepaymentsthatare due within thenext12 months. Investorswere alsorattled byreportsfrom Reutersand theFinancial TimessuggestingthatSino-chem, a Chinese conglomerate atonetime tipped to take a stake in Noble, hadlostinterestin a deal.Founded in 1986 byRichard Elman, aformerscrap-metal merchantfrom Lon-don, Noble grewfrom an initial invest-mentof$100,000 to be worth more than$10bn atitspeakin 2010. Butinvestorstookfrightin 2015 when a previouslyunknown group called IcebergResearchbegan publishingreportsquestioningNoble’saccountingpractices(Noble hasvigorouslydefended itsbook-keeping,and said a disgruntled formeremployeewasbehind the criticism). Thiscontrover-syonlymade ittougherforthe group toweathera global slump in commodityprices: overa calamitoustwo-yearperiodthe companyhasshed more than 90% ofitsvalue (see chart).Oflate, however, Noble had appearedto be makingsome progresstowardsrecovery. Ithasbeen narrowingits focusto oil and coal, and sellingoﬀinterests inagricultural tradingand in power, amongothersectors. Afterlosing$1.7bn in 2015,the companyswungto a small proﬁt lastyear. Butthisoptimism faded rapidly inearlyMay, when Noble forecasta ﬁrst-quarterlossof$130m—blamed largelyonill-judged coal trades—and warned that itmightnotreturn to proﬁtabilityuntil2019. Since then, ratingsagencies—Moody’sand Fitch, aswell asS&PGlo-bal—have all cutNoble’screditrating,alreadyclassed asjunk.Noble’sshare price tumbled furtherwhen tradingofitsstockrestarted onMay24th before recoveringto ﬁnish thedaydown by8%. Butthe drama hasdrawn more attention to negotiationsovera $2bn creditfacilitywhich thegroup needsto ﬁnance itsoperations,and which hasto be renewed orreplacedatthe end ofJune.

The deal is inthe doldrums.The pactisone ofseven “EconomicPartnership Agreements” (EPAs) the EUwantsto sign with regional groupsin Afri-ca, the Caribbean and the Paciﬁc. The ﬁrstwasagreed with the Caribbean in 2008;southern Africa followed suitlastyear. Butprogressin westAfrica hasalso stalled,with Nigeria raisingobjections.

From manipulatingLIBOR, abenchmarkinterestrate, to riggingthedailyﬁxofforeign-exchange (FX) rates,tradershave shown themselvesreadynotjustto stretch the rules, butto collude inoutrightillegality. Aglobal code ofconductforthe FXmar-ket, unveiled on May25th, aimsto putthingson a sounderfooting. Drawn upoverthe pasttwo yearsbya coalition ofcentral bankers, known astheFXWorkingGroup (FXWG), and supported bya panelofindustryparticipants, the code’s55 prin-cipleslaydown international standards onarange ofpractices, from the handling ofconﬁdential information to the pricing andsettlementofdeals.Such standardsseem longoverdue inthe massiveFXmarket. Roughly$5trn istraded everyday(see chart). Manycompa-nies, pension fundsand moneymanagersdepend on banksto hedge theirexposureto currencyﬂuctuations. Yetin the pasttraderscolluded with one anotherin inter-netchatrooms, secretlyswappingclientdata in orderto rigthe widelyused WM/Reutersbenchmarkexchange rates. Somewere caughtand ﬁred. Bankssuch asCiti-group, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Royal BankofScotland and UBSpaid billionsofdol-larsin ﬁnes. The FX markethasalwaysbeen lightlyregulated, butmanycountriesdo havecodesofconduct, usuallydrafted bythecentral bankin consultation with marketparticipants. Often, however, the codeswere defective: theymissed areasvulner-able to malpractice; and were rarelyupdat-ed, scantilyenforced and widelyﬂouted.The newcode startswith some advan-tages. Itwill supersede the national codes,and provide a single global setofprinci-ples, with adherence closelymonitored byanewlyformed committee ofcentralbankersand tradinginstitutions. Itis alsodesigned to reﬂectcurrentmarketpractice,with clearguidelineson communicationbetween participantsand on trade-execu-tion practices—two areasofweaknesshighlighted bythe scandal. ManagersofFXtraderswill nowbe en-joined to limitaccessto conﬁdential infor-mation, and to ensure thatclearguidancehasbeen given on approved channelsofcommunication. Greaterdisclosure isalsodemanded on howordersare processed,so thatclientswill neverlose oversight andcontrol oftheirtrades. The code will, however, be voluntary.GuyDebelle ofthe Reserve BankofAustra-lia, who led the drafting, reckonsthat towrite bindingrulesfora global marketwould have been more convoluted andlesseﬀective. Principles, he argues, areharderto exploitorignore than rules. Alongside the code itself, the FXWGhasdeveloped a blueprintforadoption, whichmakesthose active in the marketresponsi-ble forembeddingthe code in theirday-to-dayoperations. Central bankshave com-mitted themselvesto leadingbyexample,byimplementingthe code fortheirown FXactivities.

Whatbegan asan American on-slaught, with the Foreign AccountTaxCompliance Act(FATCA) of2010, hasbeenjoined bymore than 100 countriesthroughan initiative called the Common ReportingStandard (CRS). Underthis, governmentswill exchange taxinformation on their ﬁ-nancial ﬁrms’ clientson a regular, “auto-matic” basis, withouthavingto be askedforit, startingthisyear. Holdoutssuch asPanama, the Bahamasand Lebanon have,one byone, been frogmarched into line.Buttax-dodgersand theiradvisers areenterprisingsorts, eagerto clamberthrough the smallestloophole—and gapsin the CRSthere are. One involvesbecom-inga pensionerin HongKong.The territory, home to a bigﬁnancialcentre, hasa type ofpension known as anORS(forOccupational RetirementScheme). The beautyofORSfrom a taxevader’spointofviewisthatanyone cangetone and theyare notcaughtin the CRSnet. AGerman orAustralian with moneyto hide can setup a HongKongshell com-pany, appointhimselfasitsdirector, with alocal employmentcontract, and sign upwith a trustcompanythatprovidesanORS. He can throwin cash, propertyor oth-erassets, oversee the accounthimself, re-tire assoon orasfarin the future as he likes,and then take outasmuch oraslittle ashechooses, wheneverhe wants. An ORS, inshort, islike a ﬂexible bankaccount.The arrangementfallsoutside the CRSand FATCAbecause the HongKongau-thoritiesclassifyORSas“lowrisk” from atax-evasion standpoint, meaningthoserunningthem are “non-reportingﬁnancialinstitutions” underboth standards. Notsurprisingly, some ﬁnancial ﬁrmsarehawkingthem enthusiasticallyto foreign-ers. Abrochure from LegacyTrust, a HongKong-based ﬁrm, presentsthe ORSas“ar-guablythe mosttax-eﬃcientpensionstructure available to high net-worth indi-viduals”. Italso suggeststhatHongKong’sstatusasa respectable ﬁnancial centre, noton anyinternational taxblacklist, confers“legitimacy” on ORS. LegacyTrustdid notrespond to a requestforcomment.Taxexpertssayprivate-bankingcirclesare abuzzwith talkofORS, with hundredsofrich clientslookingto move money intothem asthe date approachesforCRScom-pliance. “I’ve metpeople with $50m,$100m even, includingfrom the Chinesemainland, lookingto do this,” saysone.“No one knowshowmuch they’re shifting.Ithasto be a lot.” Asked whetherHongKong’staxauthorityisaware ofthis, hesays: “It’seitheracquiescence orignoranceon theirpart. Eitherway, notgood.”The Financial Servicesand Treasury Bu-reau, the HongKonggovernmentdepart-mentresponsible forinternational taxmatters, saysithasweighed the risks posedbythe schemesand considersit“justiﬁ-able” to include theirmanagersasnon-re-portinginstitutions. AsofMarch 31st, therewere 4,522 ORSregistered. The pensionsregulatordeclinesto saywhetherthe num-berhasbeen growing.The OECD, which administersthe CRS,saysitisaware ofseveral supposedly ko-sherinvestmentschemesthatmaybe any-thingbut, includingORS. Itsaysitis in dis-cussionswith HongKong, though itwillnotbe drawn on when the loophole mightbe closed. Earlierthismonth, the OECDlaunched a portal where whistle-blowerscan anonymouslyreportschemesde-signed to circumventitstax-transparencystandard; theycan even upload docu-ments, such asmarketingmaterials. TheOECDsaysproductsin itssightsincludepensions, insurance and citizenship-for-sale schemes, known euphemisticallyinthe trade as“investmentmigration” pro-ducts. Tipsare alreadyﬂowingin, it says.Butthe biggesthole in the CRSisnotaproduct, norHongKong. ItisAmerica. Itgetsall the information itneedsfrom othercountriesthrough itsheavy-handed appli-cation ofFATCA, and therefore seesnoneed to sign up to the CRS. So itisin the un-ique position ofbeingable to take a lot,give little, and continue gettingaway withit. Notsurprisingly, lotsoftainted foreigncash isbelieved to have ﬂowed into Ameri-can banks, trustsand shell companies inrecentyears. Schemessuch asORSmayprovide tax-dodgingopportunitiesfor awhile yet, butAmerican non-participationis, asone OECDoﬃcial putsit, “the ele-phantin the room”. 7Tax evasionAn ORSomewheezeRich and tax-shy?

Asubsetofartiﬁ-cial intelligence (AI) thatexcelsatﬁndingpatternsand makingpredictions, itused tobe the preserve oftechnologyﬁrms. The ﬁ-nancial industryhasjumped on the band-wagon. To cite justa fewexamples, “headsofmachine-learning” can be found atPwC, a consultancyand auditingﬁrm, atJPMorgan Chase, a large bank, and atManGLG, a hedge-fund manager. From 2019,anyone seekingto become a “chartered ﬁ-nancial analyst”, a sought-afterdistinctionin the industry, will need AIexpertise topasshisexams. Despite the scepticism ofmany, includ-ing, surprisingly, some “quant” hedgefundsthatspecialise in algorithm-basedtrading, machine-learningispoised tohave a bigimpact. Innovative ﬁntech ﬁrmsand a fewnimble incumbentshave startedapplyingthe technique to everythingfromfraud protection to ﬁndingnewtradingstrategies—promisingto up-end notjustthe humdrum drudgeryofthe back-oﬃce,butthe more glamorousstuﬀup-front.Machine-learningisalreadymuch usedfortaskssuch ascompliance, riskmanage-mentand fraud prevention.

So itseemsodd thatsome prominentquantfundsare machine-learningscep-tics. Martin LueckofAspectCapital ﬁndsthe technique overrated, sayinghisﬁrmhasfound onlylimited useful applicationsforit. David Siegel, co-founderofTwo Sig-ma, a quantbehemoth, and David HardingofWinton Capital, have also argued thatthe techniquesare overhyped. In otherﬁelds, however, machine-learninghasgame-changingpotential.There isno reason to expectﬁnance to bediﬀerent.

YetGermany’sperformance will notbe easyto duplicate. Itwould be unfairto call France the sickman ofEurope; halfthe continentiswheezingorlimping. Yetthere iscertainly roomforFrench improvement. Real outputperperson hasbarely risenin the pastdecade. Governmentspendingstandsat57% ofGDP,outstrippingthe taxtake; France’sbudgetdeﬁcit, at3.4% ofGDP, isamongthe largestin the euro area’score. The biggestworry, how-ever, isthe labourmarket. The unemploymentrate, now10.1%, isstubbornlyhigh. Nearlya quarterofFrench youngadults are un-employed. Worklessness, especiallyamongyoungpeople, is asource ofrisingsocial tension and a corrosive force in French poli-tics. MrMacron mustperform the German trick—from labour-marketmorassto miracle—in halfthe time ittookGermany. Howdid the Germansmanage it? The popularnarrative of theGerman turnaround beginswith the “Hartzreforms”—namedafterPeterHartz, who ran the commission thatformulatedthem—enacted from 2003 to 2005. Germany’sstructural unem-ploymentrate had risen steadilyfrom the early1970s. Each reces-sion added workersto the joblessrollswho subsequentlyneverleft. The Hartzreformsoverhauled job trainingand placementprogrammesand reduced barriersto part-time work. Most im-portant, theytransformed a wildlygeneroussystem ofunem-ploymentand welfare payments, which allowed some workersto collectindeﬁnite beneﬁtsequivalentto abouthalf theirprevi-oussalary, into one which paid ﬁxed amountsfora limited time.The reformsinspired intense opposition and, in 2005, costGer-hard Schröderthe chancellorship (itpassed to one Angela Mer-kel). Yetthe pain appearsto have been worth it. German leadersare certainlynotslowto evangelise aboutthe beneﬁts ofreform. MrMacron, however, should be careful aboutmimicking Ger-man reformstoo slavishly. The groundworkforGermany’smir-acle waslaid well before the Hartzreforms, in response to uniquecircumstances. German reuniﬁcation in 1990 placed greatﬁscalstrain on the economy. And the collapse ofSovietpower gaveGermany’seastern neighbours—economieswith skilled but low-costworkforcesand close historical relationshipswith Ger-many—betteraccessto Western markets. Conditionsseemed ide-al fora swiftindustrial decline. Thatprospectspooked Germanworkersinto docility. Wage contractsbecame increasingly local-ised (helped bythe absence ofthe national wage ﬂoors imposedin France) and strike action wasrarerthan in France or Italy. Un-ion membership dropped; the share ofworkerscovered by in-dustry-level wage agreementsfell from 75% in 1995 to 56% in 2008. Asa result, from the early1990slabourcostsforGerman ﬁrmsfell sharplyrelative to those in othereconomies(see left-handchart). Lowlabourcostsreduced the incentive forﬁrms to shiftproduction abroad and boosted the competitivenessofGermanexports. (Flexibilityalso shielded the German labourmarket dur-ingthe GreatRecession, when a sharp fall in GDPbarelyaﬀectedthe unemploymentrate.) The same political economythat al-lowed lowerGerman labourcostsprobablyenabled the passageofthe Hartzreforms. Yetitmade itsown, independentcontribu-tion to risingGerman employment.The Macron environmentNorcan the global contextbe ignored. In the 2000sthe worldeconomygrewatan average annual pace ofaround 4%, despitethe GreatRecession. China, which boughtmuch ofthe industrialequipmentmanufactured in Germany, grewespeciallyrapidly.Boomingglobal trade ampliﬁed the beneﬁtsto Germanyof risingcompetitiveness. And German labourcostswere fallingwhilethose ofitsEuropean neighbourswere ﬂatorrising. Now, the glo-bal outlookforoutputand trade isfarmurkier. And much oftheeuro-area peripheryisalso tryingto lowerlabourcosts and boostcompetitiveness. The Hartzreformscertainlysucceeded in push-ingsome workersbackinto the labourforce and into work; oneanalysissuggeststheyreduced Germany’sstructural unemploy-mentrate by1.4 percentage points, forinstance. Butothershifts inthe economywere justascritical to the German turnaround.Moreover, change in Germany’slabourmarketwasnotastoryofimprovementacrossthe board. Growth in employmentsoared, butgrowth in total hoursworked did not. To a great ex-tent, Germanyredistributed workinghoursratherthan creatednewones. Though wagesforthe better-paid climbed rapidly, es-peciallyin manufacturing, theyfell forthe lowest-paid. So in-come inequalityin Germany, on some measures, hasfollowed aremarkablyAmerican trajectory(see right-hand chart). Increasedemploymentin France isa worthygoal; butto make itthe sole pri-oritymayhave unpleasantconsequencesforsome. The newpresidentseemsto understand thatdanger. Thoughthe detailsofhisprogramme have yetto be unveiled, they arelikelyto include reformsto French labourlawand eﬀorts to deep-en French trade relationswith Europe, in addition to more Hartz-like measures. Buta successful French turnaround will necessar-ilylookdiﬀerentfrom Germany’s.

To guard againstthis, remote towershave high levelsof re-dundancy, with backup equipmentsuchasdual powersuppliesand additionalpathwaysfordata networks.

Spare athought, in particular, forthe females ofthe cowpea seed beetle. Malesofthisspecieshave penisesarmed with sharp spikes. These can do se-riousdamage to a female’sreproductivetract.

Andtheyseem to have done so, byevolvingthickertractsheaths. Butthe details havenotbeen studied until now. Thathasjustbeen corrected byLiam DoughertyoftheUniversityofWestern Australia and hiscolleagues. Theirpaper, published in theProceedingsofthe Royal Society, looked at13 populationsofcowpea seed beetlesfrom around the world and showed howreproductive-tract-thicknessand two oth-erdefensive measuresvaried with the sizeofthe local males’ armaments. Italsoshowed thatthe cowpea seed beetle’sspiked penises, and the females’ responsesto them (or, rather, the stretchesof DNAthatunderlie these phenomena), are an ex-cellentexample ofwhatRichard Dawkins,an evolutionarybiologist, called “selﬁshgenes”. Forwhile such traitsare good forthe individual beetlesthatcarrythem, theyappearto be bad forthe health ofthe spe-ciesasa whole.Cowpea seed beetlesare widelystud-ied animalsbecause theyare importantpestsofstored pulses. Theyare found oneverycontinentexceptAntarctica (DrDougherty’sexperimental subjectswerederived from Africa, Asia and North andSouth America), and are believed to havebeen spread around the world from theirwestAfrican home byhuman travellersand traders. Hence, anydiﬀerencesbe-tween local populationsmustbe the resultofrecentevolution.DrDoughertyand hiscolleaguesﬁrstused a technique called micro-CTX-rayscanning, a miniaturised version ofmedi-cal body-scanning, to measure the thick-nessofthe reproductive tractsoffemalesfrom each ofthe populationsunderstudy.Theyalso measured the levelsin a beetle’shaemolymph (a ﬂuid thatperformsin in-sectsa similarfunction to thatperformedin mammalsbyblood) ofan enzyme calledphenoloxidase, which helpsrepairwounds. And, asa third measure ofself-protection, theymeasured female haemo-lymph’smicrobicidal potencybywatchingitseﬀecton bacteria in a Petri dish.Forthe males, the team measured thelength ofboth the ventral and the dorsalspikesofthe penis, and also the amount ofdamage, measured asscartissue a day afterintercourse, thatmalesofa particular pop-ulation inﬂicted on the reproductive tractsoffemales. (Theyused thisasa proxy forthe forcefulnessofa male’sadvances.)Theythen looked forcorrelationsbetweenmale oﬀensive measuresand female de-fensive ones.Theyattacked the data with two diﬀer-entstatistical techniques, lookingfor corre-lationsbetween the males’ characteristicsand the female ones.

Aswith computers,though, scientistsneed a wayto controltheircreations. To date, thathasbeendone with chemical signals. In a paperpublished in Nature Chemical Biology,ChristopherVoigt, a biologistatthe Mas-sachusettsInstitute ofTechnology, de-scribesan alternative. Instead ofchemi-cals, he and hiscolleaguesdemonstratehowto control customised cellswithcoloured light. Engineeringcellsto respond to light isnota newidea. The general approach iscalled optogenetics, and ithasbecome apopulartechnique forcontrollingnervecellsin neuroscience. ButDrVoigt isnotinterested in nerve cells. In 2005 he al-tered fourgenesin a strain ofEscherichiacolibacteria, which gave the creatures theabilityto respond to lightand darknessbybecominglighterordarkerin colourthemselves. The state ofthe arthas ad-vanced since then. Thistime DrVoigtwanted to see ifhe could give hisbacteri-al charges—which normallylive in thehuman gut, and therefore rarelysee lightofanysort—the abilityto sense colour. Thatmeanttinkeringwith 18 diﬀerentgenescontainingmore than 46,000 basepairsofDNA. These changespersuadedthe cellsto build three diﬀerentkinds oflightsensorsthatare similarin structureto the photoreceptorsfound in plants andalgae. These sensorsallowtheirownersto trackthingslike the time ofday and theseasons, and to plan theirreproductionaccordingly. One sensor, forinstance,harvested from a type ofalgae, switcheson when struckbylightwith a wave-length of535 nanometres(which humanswould perceive asgreen) and then oﬀagain when exposed to lightofa longer,redderwavelength. Othersensorsre-sponded to lightatthe blue and red endsofthe visible spectrum.Those photoreceptors, in turn, controlthe expression ofcertain bacterial genes.Fordemonstration purposes, DrVoigt’sprototype E. colihave been designed toproduce enzymesthatcause the bacteriato become the same colourasthe lightbeingshone upon them. So, ifa plate ofthe bacteria isstruckbya beam of greenlight, the plate becomesgreen. Ifa platehasan image composed ofred, green andblue projected upon it, the plate willreproduce the projection (see picture).

Thesmartweapon handlesall ofthe trickynavigation and targetidentiﬁcation; itscompanionsjusthave to workoutwheretheyare in relation to theirmaster, andthen go where theyare told. Data arepassed between them in briefradio chirps.DrFresconi isnotmakinga speciﬁc mis-sile. Rather, he and histeam are developingthe electronicbuildingblocksneeded toassemble a wide range ofdiﬀerentweap-ons. The resultsmightbe ﬁred from a mor-tar, from a cannon, from a rocketlaunchermounted on a lorry, orfrom the sortofweapon an individual solidermightcarry.In each case, a shell orrocketwould releaseaswarm ofsubmunitions. Underthe guid-ance ofthe masterweapon, these mightdisperse to attackindividual enemyfox-holes, orworktogetherto hita single targetlike a tankora bunkersimultaneously.Precision guidance bringsadvantagesbesidesa higherhitrate.

In the late19th centurycapital moved freelyacrossthe world and goodscrossed nation-al borders(despite tariﬀs) with the help ofcheap transport. People, too, migratedacrossthe oceanson a proportionately farbiggerscale than theydo today. All thatcame to a dramaticend with the outbreakofthe ﬁrstworld war.Trade did notrecoveritsshare of worldGDPuntil the 1960s. Butafterthe BerlinWall fell in 1989, itbecame temptingto be-lieve in a kind of“Whigtheoryofglobali-sation” with economiesgrowingevermore linked thanksto the internetand thespread ofliberal capitalism. Perhaps theworld isdue foranotherchange oftrend.Thatisthe viewofStephen King, an econo-mistatHSBC, which, asithappens, is oneofthe mostglobal ofbanks.In “Grave NewWorld” MrKingarguesthateconomicprogressthatreachesbe-yond bordersisnot“an inescapable truth”.Technologymayhave boosted globalisa-tion until now, butitmaynotdo so in fu-ture. Companiesmaydecide to replacecheap labourin the developingworld withrobotsathome, causingglobal supplychainsto collapse. The internethasalso in-creased inequalitywithin economies, asskilled workershave reaped the mostbeneﬁts, creatinga division between the“haves” and the “have nots”.Aresurgence in migration hasalsocaused a political backlash, on both eco-nomicand cultural grounds. Populistpoli-ticianshave gained voters, and even pow-erin some countries. And there maybeeven greatermigrantﬂowsto come, as Afri-ca’spopulation growsand itscitizens seekto escape from failed states, orthe conse-quencesofclimate change, and to enhancetheireconomicopportunities. The devel-oped world mayplace more restrictions oninﬂows, asAmerica did in the early20thcentury, barringboth Asiansand thosewho could notpassa literacytest. Geopolitical shiftswill also make a diﬀerence. After1945, America wasglobal-isation’sleadingarchitectand itsmainsponsor. Butitsauthorityisnowbeingchallenged on a numberoffronts. China isassertingitselfin the Paciﬁc; Russia isdoingso in eastern Europe and the Middle East.Western Europe no longerbacksAmericaon all issuesand takesa sharplydiﬀerentviewfrom Donald Trump on climatechange. The election ofMrTrump provesthatdomesticvotershave wearied ofthecountry’sglobal responsibilitiesand wantto put“America ﬁrst”.The result, saysMrKing, isthat “co-op-erative arrangementsbetween nationstateswill be increasinglyhard to come by.Conﬂict—atleastin the economicsphere—will become evermore frequent.” The can-cellation byMrTrump ofthe Trans-PaciﬁcPartnership (a trade agreementwith Asia)and the failure to agree on the Doha roundofglobal tariﬀreductionsare cases inpoint. National governmentsare turningtheirbackson global institutionsand fo-cusingon theirdomesticinterests.So whatisthe answer? The ironyis thatlikelysolutionsrequire international co-operation, the verythingthatpopulismmakesmore diﬃcult.

Until recently, a decenttranslatorcould expectasteady, tidyliving, too. Butthe industry isundergoinga wrenchingchange thatwillmake life hard forthe timid.Mosttranslatorsare freelancers, andwith the rise ofthe interneta good trans-latorcould live in Kentuckyand work forSwissbanks. Butgoingonline hasresult-ed in ﬁerce global competition that hasputenormousdownward pressure onprices. Translatorscan eitherhustle hardformore orbetter-paid work—whichmeansspendinglesstime translating—orchoose an agencythatﬁghtsforthe workforthem, butwhich also takesa cut. The alternative to schmoozingoneselforworkingwith an agencyisto marketone’sskillsin online marketplaces. Butthese displaythe mostrelentlesspricepressure ofall: feesaslowas$13-15 per1,000 wordstranslated are notunknown.Traditionally, somethingmore like $50hasbeen the lowend, with literary trans-lation ataround $120, and high-end workat$250. Buyerswho knowlittle aboutfor-eign languagesand qualitywill, in onlinemarkets, shop almostpurelyon price. To these pressurescomesanother: therise in higher-qualitymachine transla-tion. Justa yearago, machine translationstill produced reliablyrockyresults: bothinaccurate asto content, and often un-readable too. Both have improved dra-maticallywith translation enginesbasedon so-called deep neural networks. Thosewho oﬀerrock-bottom pricesfortransla-tion are almostcertainlyusingtranslationsoftware, and then givingita quick editforaccuracyand readability. Byand large,the bigtranslation agenciesare excitedabouttechnologyand the possibilities ofscale itoﬀersthem. Whatworriesthetranslatorsthemselves, though, isthat thefuture maylie in nothingmore intellectual-lypleasingthan thiskind ofclean-up. Like all incumbents, those aﬀected arenothappy. To avoid being“the coﬀee-beanpickersofthe future”, one veteran counselsimprovingspecialistknowledge and writ-ingskillsto gethigh-end work. Butnot allcan do that. Translatorsin the bulkandmiddle marketswill inevitablybe doingmore editing, orwill be squeezed out, Whatwill the restbe doing? Forone, lit-erarytranslation isunderno threat. Salesoftranslated ﬁction rose bymore than600% in Britain between 2001and 2015,and have been growingstronglyin Ameri-ca too, with bigauthorslike Elena Ferranteconditioningreadersin those countries tolookbeyond theirbordersforgood books.Nobodythinksa novel can be translatedbya machine. In RoyJacobsen’s“Unseen”,which ison the shortlistforthe 2017 ManBookerInternational Prize (MBIP), theoriginal dialectal island Norwegian hasbeen deftlyrendered byDon Bartlett andDon Shawinto a kind ofEnglish that car-riesthe same ﬂavour: “Hvurbittyitis!”(“Howsmall itis!”).

Buta goodtranslatorneedsto rethinka text, reword-ingimportantpieces, breakingup ormergingsentences, and so on. Translationsoftware can be accurate, butittranslatessentence-by-sentence. Since languageshave diﬀerentrhythmsand diﬀerent ex-pectationsforwhatcountsasa good sen-tence, thatapproach can resultin a mess.So itisoften bestsimplyto rewrite afterthinkingaboutthe intended meaning. Anothermarketis“transcreation”, inwhich a translator—often in advertis-ing—isexpected to rethinka message,makingsure thatthe version in the newlanguage hasthe rightcultural references,jokesand suchlike to recreate the impact,withoutthe wording, ofthe original. Inthiscase, the “transcreator” iseven moreofa writerthan mosttranslators.Translation ishardlyalone in beingshaken up bytechnology. The legal indus-try, accountingand manyothervenerableprofessionsare seeingrepeatable knowl-edge workdone passablybymachines.The translatorsofthe future need notonlylanguage and writingskills. Theymust, like the partnersata lawor account-ingﬁrm, gain clients’ trustand learn theirmindsin orderto do trulygood work. Thelonersofthe ﬁeld, in otherwords, mayﬁnd ithard going.Translators’ bluesJohnsonApleasinglyintellectual profession is underenormous pressurethatmanydiseaseswere caused notby“bad airs”, butbymicroscopicorganismslike bacteria. Thisled to improvements inhygiene and sanitation, aswell asthe de-velopmentofvaccines. Butviruseswerealmostunknown. The magniﬁcation ofoptical microscopeswastoo weakto showthem up. People could spotbacteria, butnotviruses, which are smallerthan thewavelength ofvisible light. Until the elec-tron microscope wasinvented in the 1930s,inﬂuenza was, like the Higgsboson before2012, a theoretical entity: itsexistence wasdeduced from itseﬀects. In the face ofsuchuncertainty, publicfaith in medicine wa-vered. People reverted to superstition: sug-arlumpssoaked in kerosene, and aromaticﬁresto clear“miasmas”.Even so, Spanish ﬂuwasexceptionallydeadly—about25 timesmore so than sea-sonal ﬂu.

In November1941a Ukranian town isthe site ofboth a brutal roundup oftheJewish population and the buildingof ahighwayforthe 1,000-yearReich. The at-tackand itsaftermath are described by atightcast: the Jewish parentswhose sonsescape; Yasia, the Ukranian farmgirl whohidesthem; herboyfriend Mykola, a RedArmydeserterpressed into German ser-vice; and Pohl, a conscience-stricken Ger-man engineeroverseeingconstruction ofthe road.From the ﬁrstscene the storyis a closestudyofmoral choice, immersed in itsequallyintense setting: wet, cold, earlywinterin the inhospitable eastern swam-pland. When Yasia runsinto the twoyoungescapees, Yankel and Momik, shefacesthe mostfundamental ofhuman di-lemmas: whetherto riskherselfto protectthe youngand vulnerable. Pohl, an engi-neer, too mustchoose.

In the yearssince, showsfrom “The X-Files” and “True Detective” to “StrangerThings” have tipped a cap to “Twin Peaks”both fordaringand vision. So expectationsforthe third season of“Twin Peaks”, whichbegan on Showtime on May21st, havebeen high. The show’screators, DavidLynch and MarkFrost, are back, and so ismuch ofthe original cast. The second sea-son ended with a cliﬀhanger, asLauraPalmer, the murdered prom queen playedbySheryl Lee, told Dale Cooper, an FBIagent, (Kyle MacLachlan, pictured): “I’ll seeyouagain in 25 years.” Thatsame sceneopensthe newdrama, butotherwise theworld of“Twin Peaks” hasmoved on. Theﬁrstiteration revolved around the mysteryofwho killed Laura. Nowthe drama restson whetherCooper, trapped in the RedRoom, can breakfree. The structure and range ofthe new“Twin Peaks” ismore ambitious. Setin variousAmerican citiesand in the town ofTwin Peakson the Paciﬁcnorth-westcoast,the action unspoolsacrossmultiple narra-tives.

GDPExternal ﬁnancial ﬂows into Africa cameto a total of $178bn in 2016, according tothe OECD, down from $183bn the yearbefore. This was largely driven by a 60%fall in the value of inﬂows of portfolioinvestments. In 2015 these made up 9%of external inﬂows; in 2016 they account-ed for only 4%. Global shocks meaninvestors have been buying fewer devel-oping-country assets. Inﬂows of oﬃcialdevelopment assistance and remittancesalso fell. But foreign direct investment inAfrica increased by 10%. Countries in theMiddle East and Asia are becoming asource of cash for greenﬁeld projects.Total external inﬂows are expected toincrease slightly this year, partly due to aprojected rise in remittances.78The EconomistMay27th2017STROLLINGdown a corridorin a high-securityjail in 1981, where he wasdirect-ingan interview, RogerAilessuddenlybumped chestswith CharlesManson.America’smostnotoriouskillerlookedmean and wiry, like a dangerousferret. MrAiles, in hisown telling, methisgaze calm-ly. “MrManson,” he said, “I’m in charge ofthisinterview. I’d like youto come withme.” And Manson did so, head lowered.The founderofFoxNewsseldom had aconfrontation he wasn’treadyfor, and hislife wasfull ofthem. Everyone wasout togethim, buttheywouldn’twin. He would.Liberal elitists, jargon-spoutingintellectu-alsand anyone who gotup in the morningblamingAmerica forthe world’sillswouldsoon hearfrom him, and how. Ifsome-bodygotin hisface, he’d getin theirface. Foxdid notcome to be the number-onecable-newsnetworkin America forfully 15years, squashingTed Turner’sCNNlike abug, byparadinggreytalkingheadsoﬀer-ingseriousanalysis. On FoxNewsthescreen ﬂashed up constantalerts, loudwhooshingheralded bigstories, hotblonde anchorsbeamed through layersoflip glossand commentatorsbawled ateachother. Itwasa show; hisshow. He pickedmen to be pugnaciousand women fornicebreastsand sexystockings. Newsand en-tertainmentmightbe separate domains,buthe intended to walkrightup to the lineand planthisfooton it. “Fairand balanced” washismotto. Tothose who thoughtFoxlacked eithervir-tue, he replied thathissingle channel wasgivingAmerica’slegionsofconservativeswhatCNN, NBC, CBS, ABCand MSNBC al-readyoﬀered liberals. “Balance” washowhe persuaded RupertMurdoch, CEOofNewsCorporation, to launch the networkin 1996 with $1bn and a free hand. Hisviewerswere notmoron rednecks, astheliberal media thought. Theywere ordinaryJoeswho worked hard, loved America,supported the armed forces, didn’tcareaboutfeminism orpolluted rivers, thoughtdependingon federal handoutswasa sin,and didn’tlive in NewYork. Good people,like those he had known growingup in ablue-collarfamilyin Ohio, a weakly, hae-mophiliacboywho nonethelesswantedto be a combatpilot, and liked a ﬁght. He wasproud ofthose credentials.Proud, too, thathe had come up the hardway, gettinginto studentradio to pay forcollege and then slavingata TV station inCleveland, fetchingsandwichesforthe starguestson “The Mike DouglasShow”. Itwasthrough thisshow(which he eventu-allyran, gettingitsyndicated in 180 cities)thathe metRichard Nixon and found fameassomeone who knew, asfewdid then,the powerofthe small screen. To Nixon heexplained in 1967 thatTVwasno gimmick,butcould make orbreakpoliticians. Healso told thisuneasy, “somewhatweird”man howthe medium could ﬂatterhim. MrAiles’srulesforsellinga TVmessagewere simple. Hisbook, “Youare the Mes-sage”, spelled itout. Playto yourstrengths.Don’tpickdefence. Saywhatyouwant tosay. Be emotional, notintellectual; keep tothemes, avoid details. These lessonshetaughtRonald Reagan in 1984 forhisseconddebate with WalterMondale; Reagan wonthe election. So did several otherswhomMrAilesadvised to parade theirdear oldmothers, ortheirdancingskills, rather thanprove theirﬁtnessforthe Senate. Thiswasthe attitude he broughtto Fox.Itspersonalitieswere striking, becauseviewerswould decide in seven secondswhetherornotto watch. The debateswerepunchyand graphic, because viewerstiredofargumentsin a minute. Foxstressedthemes, notfacts, tugged heartstrings andbanged drumsforAmerica’swars. Itpushed conspiracies, from Benghazi toObama-is-a-Muslim, which the NewYorkTimes, that“cesspool ofbias”, barelymen-tioned. And, like him, itwasoften angry. Some called him the mostdangerousman in the country, ﬁlling2m headsa nightwith ﬂaminggarbage. (These were mostlyelderly, male, white heads; 40% ofTrumpvotersrelied on him fortheirnews.) “Herecomesthe mostpowerful man in Ameri-ca,” said BarackObama once, ashe lum-bered up. He liked that, and relished howotherchannelscopied him; cable, he saidprescientlyin 2003, was“beginningtochange the agenda ofwhatisnews”. Buthestill believed he wasbalancingthatnews,notskewingit. He recruited Democrats forFox, too. He gave Obama grief, butalsogave Bush grief. In the pasthe had inter-viewed Malcolm Xseveral times, and aportraitofFDRhungin hislibrary. UndersiegeNotmany(save ZevChafets, hisbiogra-pher) knewthat. MrAilesliked both pri-vacyand secrecy. In hisNewYorkoﬃce,behind a stoutwooden doorwith theblindsdrawn, he obsessivelycheckedFox’sstandingsagainstCNN,his“holywar”. On the wall wasa picture ofWash-ington’scamp atValleyForge; like his hero,he too wasundersiege. Enemieswere allaround. By2016 theywere also emergingfrom within Fox, in the shape ofwomenemployeessuinghim forgropingandpropositioning. “Ifyouwantto playwiththe bigboys, youhave to laywith the bigboys,” one claimed he told her. He said itwasall made up, butitmarked the end ofhistime atFoxand theend, too, ofhispower. Suddenly, he wasthe one backingdown and unprepared.Thisreversal ofroleswasdeath in itself.7The man forthe messageRogerAiles, founderofFoxNews, died on May18th, aged 77ObituaryRoger AilesThe commercial payments world is changing.Are you ready?The only global event dedicated to commercial cards and paymentsGlobal Commercial Cards & Payments SummitSeptember 12-13, 2017  |  New York City, USwww.commercialpaymentsinternational.com/global
