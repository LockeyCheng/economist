To many, India feelslike the heirapparent. Itspopulationwill soon overtake itsAsian rival’s. Itoccasionallygrowsat thekind ofpace thatpropelled China to the statusofeconomic superpower. And itsmiddle classisthoughtbymanyto be inthe earlystagesofthe journeyto prosperitythatcreated hun-dredsofmillionsofChinese consumers.

Rare isthe chiefexecutive who, upon visitingIndia, doesnot pro-claim itascentral to hisorherplans. Some ofthat maybe a dip-lomaticdose ofﬂattery; much ofit, from ﬁrmssuch asIKEA,SoftBank, Amazon and Starbucks, issincerelymeant. Hold yourelephants. The Indian middle classconjured upbythe marketersand consultantsscarcelyexists. Firms ped-dlinganythingmuch beyond soap, matchesand phone-creditare targetinga minuscule slice ofthe population (see page 16).The top 1% ofIndian adults, a rich enclave of8m inhabitantsmakingatleast$20,000 a year, equatesto roughlyHongKongin termsofpopulation and average income. The next9% isakin to central Europe, in the middle ofthe global wealth pack.The next40% ofIndia’spopulation neatlymirrorsitscom-bined South Asian poorneighbours, Bangladesh and Pakistan.The remaininghalf-billion orso are on a parwith the mostdes-titute bitsofAfrica. To be sure, global companiestake the mar-ketsofcentral Europe seriously. Plentyoffortuneshave beenmade there. Buttheyare no China.Centre partingWorse, the chancesofIndia developinga middle class tomatch the Middle Kingdom’sare beingthrottled bygrowinginequality. The top 1% ofearnerspocketed nearlya third of allthe extra income generated byeconomicgrowth between 1980and 2014, accordingto newresearch from economistsinclud-ingThomasPiketty. The well-oﬀare ten timesricher nowthanin 1980; those atthe median have noteven doubled their in-come. India hasdone a good job atgettingthose earning be-low$2 a day(atpurchasing-powerparity) to $3, butithasnotmatched othercountries’ recordsin gettingthose on $3 a daytoearning$5, those at$5 a dayto $10, and so on. Middle earners incountriesatIndia’sstage ofdevelopmentusuallytake more ofthe gainsfrom growth. Eightin ten Indianscite inequality asabigproblem, on a parwith corruption. The reasonsforthisfailure are notmysterious. Decades ofstatistintervention meantthatwhen a measure ofliberalisa-tion came in the early1990s, onlya fewwere able to beneﬁt.The workforce iswoefullyunproductive—no surprise giventhe abysmal state ofIndia’seducation system, which churnsoutmillionsofadultsequipped onlyformenial work. Itsgrad-uatesgo on to toil in small ormicro-enterprises, operating in-formally; these “employ” 93% ofall Indians. The greatswell ofmiddle-classjobsthatChina created asitbecame the work-shop to the world isnotto be found in India, because turningsmall businessesinto productive large onesismade nigh-onimpossible bybureaucracy. The factthatbarelya quarter ofwomen work—a share thathasseen a precipitousdecline inthe pastdecade—onlymakesmattersworse. Good policycan do an enormousamountto improve pros-pects. However, hope should be tempered byrealism. India isblessed with a deeplyentrenched democraticsystem, but thatisno shield againstpoordecisions. The sudden and brutal “de-monetisation” ofthe economyin 2016 wasmeantto targetfatcats, butended up hurtingeverybody. And the path to prosper-itywalked byChina, where manufacturingproduced the jobsthatpushed up incomes, isnarrowingasautomation limits op-portunitiesforfactorywork. All ofwhich meansthatcompaniesneed to deal with theIndia thatexiststodayratherthan the one theywish to emerge.AstrategyofwaitingforIndiansto develop a taste for productsthatthe global middle classindulgesin—carsasincome perhead crossesone threshold, foreign holidayswhen itcrossesthe next—maylead to decadesoffrustration. Only3% ofIndi-anshave everbeen on an aeroplane; onlyone in 45 ownsa carorlorry. Ifnearly300m Indianscountas“middle class”, asHSBChasproclaimed, some ofthem make around $3 a day.

In “Fire and Fury”,Michael Wolﬀ’sgossipytale ofthe White House, which did notwelcome MrTrump’sanniver-saryso much aspunch itin theface, the leaderofthe free world isportrayed asa monstrouslyselﬁsh toddler-emperorseen byhisown staﬀasunﬁt foroﬃce(see ourreviewon page 70). America iscaughtup in a debateaboutthe president’ssanity. Seeminglyunable to contain him-self, MrTrump fansthe ﬂamesbytakingto Twitterto crowabouthis“verystable genius” and, in a threatto North Korea,to boastaboutthe impressive size ofhisnuclearbutton.Trump-watchingiscompulsive—who hasn’twaited guiltilyforthe nexttweetwith horriﬁed anticipation? Given howmuch restson the man’sshoulders, and howill-suited he istothe presidency, the focuson MrTrump’scharacterisboth rea-sonable and necessary. But, asa record ofhispresidency so far,itisalso incomplete and a dangerousdistraction. ManyhappyretweetsTo see whyitisincomplete, considerﬁrstthatthe Americaneconomyisin ﬁne fettle, growingbyan annualised 3.2% in thethird quarter(see page 27). Blue-collarwage growth isoutstrip-pingthe restofthe economy. Since BarackObama left, unem-ploymenthascontinued to fall and the stockmarketto climb.MrTrump islucky—the world economyisenjoyingitsstron-gestsynchronised upswingsince 2010. Buthe hasmade hisluckbyconvincingcorporate America thathe ison its side. FormanyAmericans, especiallythose disillusioned with Wash-ington, a jeremiad overthe imminentthreatto all of Americafrom MrTrump simplydoesnotringtrue.Despite hisgrenade-throwingcampaign, MrTrump has notcarried outhisworstthreats. Asa candidate he spoke aboutslapping45% tariﬀson all Chinese goodsand rewritingorditchingthe North American Free-Trade Agreementwith Can-ada and Mexico. There maysoon be trouble on both thosefronts, butnoton thatoriginal scale (see page 60). He alsobranded NATOasobsolete and proposed the massdeporta-tion of11m illegal immigrants. So far, however, the Western alli-ance holdsand the level ofdeportationsin the 12 monthstoSeptember2017 wasnotstrikinglydiﬀerentfrom earlier years. In oﬃce MrTrump’slegislative accomplishmentshavebeen modest, and mixed. Ataxreform thatcutratesand sim-pliﬁed some ofthe ruleswasalso regressive and unfunded.Hisantipathyto regulation hasinvigorated animal spirits, butatan unknown costto the environmentand human health.Hisproposed withdrawal from the Parisclimate agreementand the ﬂedglingTrans-PaciﬁcPartnership was, in our view,foolish, buthardlybeyond the pale ofRepublican thinking. Hisopportunism and lackofprinciple, while shameful,mayyetmean thathe ismore open to dealsthan mostof hispredecessors. Justthisweek, he combined a harsh plan to de-portSalvadoreanswho have temporaryrightsto live and workin America with the suggestion ofa broad reform to immigra-tion (see nextleader). He also said thathe will be going to Da-vos, where he will rub shoulderswith the globalists.The dangerofthe Trump characterobsession isthat itdis-tractsfrom deeperchangesin America’ssystem ofgovern-ment. The bureaucracyisso understaﬀed thatitisrelying onindustryhacksto draftpolicy. Theyhave shaped deregulationand written clausesinto the taxbill thatpasscosts from share-holdersto society. Because Senate Republicansconﬁrmed sofewjudgesin MrObama’slasttwo years, MrTrump ismovingthe judiciarydramaticallyto the right(see page 28). And non-stop outrage also drownsoutWashington’sproblem: the pow-erofthe swamp and itsdisconnection from ordinaryvoters. Covfefe and othermysteriesAswe have written repeatedlyoverthe pastyear, MrTrump isadeeplyﬂawed man withoutthe judgmentortemperamentto lead a greatcountry. America isbeingdamaged byhis presi-dency. But, aftera certain point, rakingoverhisunﬁtness be-comesan exercise in wish-fulﬁlment, because the subtext issooften the desire forhisearlyremoval from oﬃce. Forthe time beingthatisa fantasy. The Muellerprobe intohiscampaign’sdealingswith Russia should run itscourse.Onlythen can America hope to gauge whetherhisconductmeetsthe testforimpeachment. OustingMrTrump via the25th Amendment, assome favour, would be even harder. Thetype ofincapacityitsauthorshad in mind wasa comatoseJohn F. Kennedyhad he survived hisassassination. MrTrump’smental state isimpossible to diagnose from afar, buthe doesnotappearto be anymadderthan he waswhen thevoterschose him overHillaryClinton (see page 32). Unlesshecan no longerrecognise himselfin the mirror(which, in MrTrump’scase, would surelybe one ofthe lastpowersto fade)neitherhiscabinetnorCongresswill vote him out.Neithershould they. Alarm atMrTrump’svandalism to thedignityand normsofthe presidencycutsboth ways. Were iteasyfora group ofWashington insidersto remove a presidentusingthe 25th Amendment, American democracywouldswerve towardsoligarchy. The rush to condemn, orexonerate,MrTrump before MrMuellerﬁnisheshisinquirypoliticisesjustice. Each time MrTrump’scriticsputtheiraim ofstoppinghim before theirmeansofdoingso, theyfeed partisanship andhelp seta precedentthatwill somedaybe used against a goodpresidentﬁghtinga worthybutunpopularcause. ThatlogicholdsforNorth Korea, too. MrTrump isnot theﬁrstpresidentto raise questionsaboutwho isﬁtto control nuc-learweapons—considerRichard Nixon’sdrinkingorKenne-dy’sreliance on painkillers, anti-anxietydrugsand, during theCuban Missile Crisis, an antipsychotic. OustingMrTrump onthe gutfeelingthathe mightbe mentallyunstable smacks ofacoup. Would youthen remove a hawkforbeingtrigger-happyoran evangelical forbelievingin the Rapture? MrTrump hasbeen a poorpresidentin hisﬁrstyear. In hissecond he maycause America grave damage. Butthe presiden-tial telenovela isa diversion. He and hisadministration needto be held properlyto accountforwhattheyactually do. 7Trump’s AmericaOne yearoldWashington is all Trump all ofthe time.

Earth-quakesin herhome countryin2001broughthergood fortuneofa sort: she wasamong290,000 Salvadoreanswho re-ceived “temporaryprotected status” (TPS) from the Americangovernment. Thatallowed herto live and workin America—inYork, Pennsylvania, renovatingand rentingouthouses—whileEl Salvadorrecovered. The American governmenthasre-newed Salvadoreans’ protected statusperiodicallyeversince.MsAguilar’schildren have grown up in the country.On January8th the Trump administration said enough wasenough. From September2019 the 200,000 orso Salvadoreanswho still have TPSwill have to leave iftheycannotﬁnd a legalwayto remain (see page 35). The Salvadoreansshare theirplightwith 46,000 Haitians, who gotTPSafteran earthquakein 2010, and 2,500 Nicaraguans, protected afterHurricaneMitch in 1998. Some 60,000 Hondurans, also exiled byHurri-cane Mitch, awaitword oftheirfate. Donald Trump won the presidencypromisingto keep outunwanted foreignersand expel those with no legal right to bein the country. Some ofhisideasfordoingthat, such as build-inga wall on the Mexican borderand barringcitizens ofsomeMuslim countries, are unworkable, discriminatoryorboth.On January9th a federal judge temporarilybanned the ad-ministration from deporting800,000 migrantswho came toAmerica aschildren and were protected byBarackObama’sDeferred Action forChildhood Arrivals(DACA) programme.EndingTPSforSalvadoreansand othersislegallyand politi-callyeasier. Temporaryoughtto mean temporary, the admin-istration contends. The emergencythatled to TPSisover. El Sal-vadorhasrebuiltschools, repaired roadsand restored watersupplies, helped byAmerican aid. Salvadoreanswho go homewill ﬁnd themselvesin a poorerand more dangerouscountrythan America, butthatistrue ofmanyplaces. IfTPSbecomesnothingmore than a pretextforillegal immigrantsto settle,howcan the governmentextend such protection to citizens ofcountriesthatmaybe ravaged byfuture disasters?Those are good points. Still, America ismakinga mistake.Salvadoreanswith TPShave been in the countryforatleast 17years; Honduransand Nicaraguanshave been there even lon-ger. Manyhave jobs, mortgagesand American children, someofwhom do notspeakSpanish. Even ifitwasunwise to letthem stayso longin the ﬁrstplace, thatdoesnotmean itisrightto expel them now. MrTrump should notsuddenlyand capri-ciouslyuprootfamilieswho, after17 years, have inevitablycome to see themselvesassettled. Take the heatShorn ofTPS, manySalvadoreanswill join America’s11m ille-gal immigrantswith no rightto work. Unless, thatis, Congresspassesa comprehensive immigration reform thattreats all ofthem humanelyand fairly. Anysensible lawwould oﬀermany—especiallythose in the countrylongest—the right toworkand a path to permanentresidence. In a televised meetingwith Republican and Democraticlawmakerson January9th, MrTrump appeared to open thedoorto such a reform, sayingthathe would “take the heat” fordisappointingsupporterswho ferventlyoppose anything thatlookslike amnesty. Itishard to knowwhetherhe means it—hehascontradicted himselfso often. And even ifhe does, he willface a monumental taskin persuadingCongressto go along.Butthe prize would be great: peace ofmind forMsAguilar andhundredsofthousandslike her, and a featofstatesmanship forapresidentwho so farhasnone to hiscredit. 7ImmigrationTime fora ﬁxTemporary protected statusIndividuals in the United States, Oct 17El SalvadorLatin America& Caribbean*AsiaMiddle East*Excl.

2 year’s speech, Mr Kim reiterated the “reali-
ty” that North Korea is a nuclear state and
will “mass-produce” nuclear weapons. 
Observers note that the North rarely
acts in good faith. It has reneged on previ-
ous agreements and tends to talk when it
needs money. Joongang Ilbo, a centre-right
South Korean daily, warned the govern-
ment not to “get drunk on the conversa-
tional mood” and forget that denuclearisa-
tion is the only way to long-term peace. Rex
Tillerson, America’s secretary of state, has
said much the same. Many observers as-
sume that the North merely plans to string
South Korea along while it perfects its nuc-

lear arsenal.
Nonetheless, Donald Trump’s adminis-
tration, initially cool about the prospect of
North-South talks, has endorsed them (al-
though it has warned Mr Moon against ap-
peasing the North). America has agreed to
postpone regular joint military exercises
with South Korea until the games con-
clude. This is a striking shift of tone for Mr
Trump, who recently boasted on Twitter of
having a bigger and better nuclear button
than Mr Kim. 
In theory the next round of talks could
get into issues that stop short of denuclear-
isation but reduce the chance of an acci-

dental conﬂagration. South Korea is con-
cerned 
to avoid ﬂare-ups
in 
the
demilitarised zone, which separates the
two countries. It could try to persuade the
North to pick up the hotline more consis-
tently when the South calls, or even to al-
low the International Atomic Energy
Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities. 
Ri Son Gwon, the head of the North’s
delegation, joked that bilateral relations
are “more frozen” than the winter weather.
It was a rare example of a North Korean of-
ﬁcial telling the truth. Whether he repeats
this remarkable feat during the talks re-
mains to be seen. 7

Parenting in Singapore

Rules are thicker than blood

S i n g a p o r e

Pakistan and Amer ica

Here we go again

a Singaporean father are not automatical-
ly entitled to Singaporean citizenship,
depriving them of yet more beneﬁts. 
In her ruling, which the couple plan to
appeal, Shobha Nair, the judge, tut-tutted
about “the use of money to encourage
the movement of life from one hand to
another” (payment for adoption is illegal
in Singapore). But many heterosexual
Singaporean couples conceive using
foreign surrogates each year, although
they may attempt to conceal this from the
authorities. 
Ms Nair also excoriated the pair for
trying to ﬁnd a way to start a family, or for
“walking through the back door of the
system when the front door was ﬁrmly
shut”. She claimed that “it is no place of
this Court to dictate to the applicant what
a family unit ought to…look like,” even as
her ruling ﬁrmly laid out that the ideal
family unit, in the eyes of the Singapor-
ean state, entails the marriage of a man to
a woman. 

A bizarre court case exposes the city-state’s Victorian attitudes to families
IT SOUNDS like something out of a
Lewis Carroll novel. First, a father had
to petition the courts to be allowed to
adopt his own biological son, who was
born in America with the help of a surro-
gate, and thus was not automatically
considered his child under Singaporean
law. Then on December 27th a judge
ruled that the adoption would not be
allowed. That, in turn, prevents the child,
who lives in Singapore with his Singapor-
ean father and his father’s Singaporean
partner, from becoming a Singaporean
citizen. Instead each year his parents will
have to apply for temporary leave for
him to remain. As well as being topsy-
turvy, the case feels like a scene from
“Alice in Wonderland” in another way:
the Singaporean government’s attitude to
families is remarkably Victorian.
The two men involved in the case did
not have a child lightly. After they had
been a couple for 15 years and had lived
together for nine, they looked into adopt-
ing, but found that an “unwritten policy”
barred gay couples from adopting in
Singapore (as written ones did until
recently in much of the West). What is
more, an unwed, heterosexual man can
only adopt a boy. After much research,
the couple paid $200,000 to an Ameri-
can ﬁrm to help them conceive abroad.
“We thought that in starting our family,
the best way was surrogacy,” says one. 
But under Singaporean law, any child
born to an unmarried couple (including
all gay ones) is deemed illegitimate. That
means the parents do not receive a “baby
bonus” from the state or certain tax
breaks accorded to the parents of legiti-
mate children. The child does not auto-
matically inherit anything when both
parents die. The family will have a harder
time gaining access to public housing.

America freezes military aid to Pakistan
IT WAS only a matter of time before Do-
nald Trump, with his deep conviction
that foreigners are taking America for a
ride, discovered Pakistan. “The United
States has foolishly given Pakistan more
than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15
years, and they have given us nothing but
lies & deceit,” America’s president raged in
his ﬁrst tweet of 2018. “They give safe ha-
vens to the terrorists we hunt in Afghani-
stan…No more!” On January 4th America
announced that it would suspend most se-
curity assistance to Pakistan pending a
more credible eﬀort to expel the Taliban
and other enemies of Afghanistan’s gov-
ernment from the Pakistani side of the two
countries’ long border.
The State Department estimates the
suspension will cost Pakistan $2bn in aid
already budgeted. It is similar to many pre-
vious American eﬀorts to change the be-
haviour of the generals who dictate Paki-
stan’s security policy. The administration
of Barack Obama froze aid to Pakistan sev-
eral times for the same reason—the gener-
als’ refusal to crack down on the militants,
chieﬂy, in recent years, a jihadist network
founded by Jalaluddin Haqqani, a former
anti-Soviet commander who is based in
the Pakistani tribal area of North Waziri-
stan (see map on next page). Mr Obama
suspended $800m in aid in 2011 and
$300m in 2016. Congress blocked the sale
of F-16 ﬁghters to Pakistan the same year.
None of those admonitions worked.
Pakistan’s powerful military spy agency,
the Inter-Services Intelligence, appears to
have pushed the Haqqani network from
Miran Shah, North Waziristan’s capital, far-
ther towards the lightly monitored frontier.
But the generals are reluctant to squeeze
harder. They fear more blowback of the

Forthe ﬁrstpart, theycalled ontradition. Theyputthe imperial line, hitherto mere props inKyoto, backatthe centre ofthe polity. Theybroughtthe 12-year-old emperor, Mutsuhito, up to Edo (nowrenamed Tokyo, or East-ern Capital), aﬃrmed hisunbroken descentfrom the sun goddessand claimed to rule on hisbehalf.

Fiftyhigh oﬃcials setoﬀon a22-month world tourto take in everythingtheycould aboutAmerican and European government, industry, trade, educationand warfare. Backin Japan theylaunched a frenzyofindustrialdevelopment, administrative reform and militarymodernisa-tion noteven matched byChina’smore recentheadlonggrowth.The Meiji restoration wasactuallya revolution. ForShinzo Abe, Japan’scurrentprime minister, the restorationresonates. MrAbe comesfrom Yamaguchi, known in feudaltimesasChoshu. Leadersfrom Choshuwere atthe head of therevolution. MrAbe once told thiscolumnisthe identiﬁed withthem because theydid “notsimplylookinward, butlooked…tothe world’swiderhorizons”. The Choshumen, he explained, sawthe threatfrom Western imperialism. Japan’sharsh choice wasei-therto be the meatserved ata Western banquetora guest atthetable. Bymodernising, Japan became the onlybigcountry in Asiato safeguard itsindependence. Itjoined the Western high table.MrAbe seeslessonsin all this, and since he came to oﬃce in2012 he hasappeared to be in a tearinghurryto implement them.Athome Japan isimperilled bya weakeconomy, a risk-averse es-tablishmentand an ageing, shrinkingpopulation. Overseas, Chi-na threatensJapan notjustin economictermsbut, asit growsmore assertive, militarilytoo. Arevived economy(with more op-portunitiesforwomen atwork), a vigorousdiplomacyand, not-withstandingthe constraintsofa paciﬁstpost-warconstitution, astrongerdefence are to him the rightresponses. (Theyalso helpconfrontthe threatposed bya nuclearNorth Korea.)The governmenthasgone all-outto promote the 150th anni-versary, startingwith a push in 2015 to acquire UNESCO“worldheritage” statusforvariousspotsimportantin the ensuing indus-trial revolution.

(Todayitspost-apocalypticruinsare bestknown asthe lairofJamesBond’snemesisin “Skyfall”.)The governmentwebsite celebratingthe Meiji restoration ide-alisesthe period asone ofgrass-rootschange and human rightsasmuch asinnovation. Yetforethnicgroupswhose territory wasannexed and culture stiﬂed, such asthe Ainuin the north andOkinawansin the south, itwasnotmuch fun. The rank-and-ﬁle inthe newconscriptarmywere brutalised. Workersin the minesand millsled harsh lives. And women, pointsoutTomomi Yama-guchi ofMontana State University, were keptdown. They couldnotvote, divorce orown property. MostJapanese women ﬁnd lit-tle appeal in the nostalgicpush byMrAbe’sLiberal DemocraticPartyto return to the Meiji era’s“familyvalues”. Don’tmention the warThere isanotherproblem. The Meiji restoration sowed the seedsofJapan’s20th-centuryaggression. The ﬁrstwardead whosesoulswere honoured atTokyo’sYasukuni shrine, latercontrover-sial forhonouringwarcriminals, were those who died ﬁghtingforthe restoration (though even the losingside wassupposedlyﬁghtingforthe emperor). The authoritarian constitution of1890,borrowed from thatofBismarck’sGermany, fostered emperor-worship and gloriﬁcation ofthe armed forces—powerful featuresofJapan’swarmachine.Bythe time ofJapan’sdefeatin 1945 thousandsofKoreansandChinese had been forced to workthe minesin Hashima, amongmanyothersites. MrAbe’sgovernment, aftermuch resistance,promised UNESCO itwould reﬂectthishistory. Yeton Hashimaneitherthe guidesnorthe pamphletsand signsreferto it. Mem-bersofMrAbe’sgovernment, and attimesthe prime ministerhimself, seem to denythe existence offorced labourat all.Youcan see the conundrum withoutsympathisingwith it.Those, like MrAbe, who are lessthan frankin acknowledging Ja-pan’swartime past, are worried aboutpullingon a thread. Noclearevent, no Reichstagﬁre, marked the momentwhen thecountrylurched into militarism. Ifaspectsofwhatthe Meiji resto-ration wroughtcome into question, whatisthere leftto be proudabout? The questto ﬁnd a modern identityforJapan continues. 7Restore and forgetWhythe Meiji restoration of1868 still divides JapanBanyanThe EconomistJanuary13th2018251For daily analysis and debate on China, visitEconomist.com/chinaCOMMUNISTcountrieshave alwaysliked model workers.

There will be lessin-centive forfarmersto growgrain in placeswhere itiscostlyto do so, such asin thenorth where waterisscarce. The govern-mentwill still help them, however, byboostingfarm subsidies.The legacyofMaoJustasimportantare changesto land ten-ure, aimed atencouragingthe growth oflargerfarmsand newinvestmentin them.Almostall farmland in China isowned byvillage collectives. In the 1980shouseholdswere given the rightto use a portion oftheland forthemselves. Since 2008 theyhavehad the rightto lease these rightsto others(thisishowMrZhangputtogetherhis veg-etable operation). Butthere hasbeen abottleneck: a lackoflegal clarityabout theboundariesoffarmers’ ﬁelds. Thishashampered the growth oflargerfarms. Therecentcensusfound only4m “scaled-upfarms”, 2% ofthe total. Almost30% ofthemwere in livestockorﬁsh farming, comparedwith only4% forall farms. Thisreﬂects thecontinued importance ofideology: ani-malsare regarded asprivate property butland ascollective.

And because food quan-tityhastaken priorityoverquality, therehave been huge food scares.The rural economyremainsbackward.Arecentagricultural censusshowed therewere 314m people employed in farmingin2016. Thatis40% ofChina’sworkforce. Yetagriculture accountsforlessthan 9% ofGDP, which meansthatrural labouris stillextremelyunproductive.Moreover, the exodusfrom the land hasslowed, implyingthatthe problem ofun-deremploymentisnotgoingaway. Thefarmingpopulation fell by100m in the de-cade to 2006 butonly28m in the followingten years. Mostofthose still tilling theﬁeldsare old and ill-schooled.

And thereisno hintthatChina iswillingto let farm-ersown land in orderto capture the beneﬁtofrisingland prices—a common route towealth forfarmersin othercountries butstill anathema to the party’sideologues.Until thathappens, the growth oflargefarmsislikelyto remain slow. 7The environmentFeelinggreenCHINA’Sleadersno longerpaysingle-minded homage to the cultofGDP.Butalthough theirgoalshave becomemore eclectic, theyoften pursue them inmuch the same way: bysettingmeasur-able, quantitative targetsthatare used torate and motivate provincial oﬃcials.

This“objective” indexwasaccom-panied bya surveyofresidents’“subjective” satisfaction with theirenvi-ronment, a rare example ofoﬃcialsaskingpeople directlyhowtheyfeelaboutthe government’sworkand pub-lishingthe results.

Butconstructingan accu-rate lineage could be tough, notonly be-cause ofthe huge numberofLius. In acountrythatin recentdecadeshasseen thebiggestmovementofpeople in historyawayfrom theirancestral homes, genea-logical recordsare patchy.Veneration ofancestorsispartof Chi-nese culture. Traditionallythisrequired thescrupulousupdatingofgenealogiesbyfamilyelders. These were recorded inbooksknown aszuputhatlisted membersofeach generation—though typicallyonlythe men. Zupu were often keptin ancestralshrines(such asthe one pictured, dedicat-ed to a clan surnamed Li in the southerncityofGuangzhou). Butwarand migrationin the pasttwo centurieshave complicatedmatters. UnderMao, the CommunistPartytried to stamp outancestorworship. Manyzupuwere destroyed. MrLiuwasborn inJiangsu, an eastern province, and can tracehisheritage backto a branch ofthe Liu fam-ilyin the central province ofHunan. Therethe trail goescold because the relevantzupu ismissing, saylocal media.In the West, people tryingto trace theirlineage often consultwebsitesthatprovidedata from sourcessuch ascensusrecordsand church registers.

Overthe past couple ofdecades, clan associationshave re-estab-lished themselvesand worked to compilerecordsagain. Zuputhatwere hidden inMao’sday, ortaken abroad, have helped toﬁll in gaps.

Butwithinhoursofhisvictoryinvestorschangedcourse. ATrump presidency, theyrea-soned, would mean taxcuts, deregulationand infrastructure spending—in otherwords, more growth. AyearafterMrTrump tookoﬃce, itlookslike the rethinkwasjustiﬁed. Little ofwhatwasfearedaboutMrTrump’seconomicpolicyhascome to pass. To some, risingeconomicgrowth, which exceeded 3% in the secondand third quartersof2017, combined withacceleratingblue-collarwages, suggest thatMrTrump hasdelivered on hispromise toinvigorate the economy.In truth, MrTrump hasbeneﬁted from aglobal economicsurge thathaslifted conﬁ-dence—and stockmarkets—acrossthe richworld. Histimingwith regard to the labourmarketwasparticularlyfortunate. Hecame to oﬃce with unemploymentat4.8%and falling(itisnow4.1%). Pocketsofstrongwage growth, and high consumerconﬁ-dence, are the natural result.However, MrTrump hasatleastnot dis-rupted the economicrecovery. Hisworstideas, particularlywith regard to trade, re-main on the shelf. There have been noacross-the-board tariﬀson Chinese or Mex-ican imports, ashe threatened. In April thepresidentsupposedlycame close to pull-ingoutofthe North American Free-Tradecause the economydoesnotneed ﬁscalstimulusatthe moment. Yettheyshouldboostgrowth somewhat, dependingonhowmuch the Federal Reserve tightensmonetarypolicyin response. Thatmay de-pend on Jerome Powell, MrTrump’snomi-nee to chairthe Fed, from February. (MrPowell’snomination wasan example ofmoderation. He iswidelyexpected to con-tinue the approach ofJanetYellen, the in-cumbentwhom MrTrump ﬁercelycon-demned while runningforoﬃce.)On regulation MrTrump hasstayedmuch closerto hiscampaign rhetoric. Gov-ernmentagencieshave all butstoppedwritingnewrules. The clean powerplan,PresidentBarackObama’sﬂagship envi-ronmental regulation, isbeingunwound.The Federal CommunicationsCommis-sion hasvoted to repeal netneutralityrules. The administration letMrObama’sproposed rule on overtime paydie in courtand delayed newregulationsgoverning re-tirementadvice.

NAFTArenegotiation issup-posed to be concluded before the Mexicanelectoral cycle acceleratesin mid-February,butAmerica’sdemandshave been ill re-ceived.

Butifa trade calamitycan be avoided,the prospectsforthe economyin 2018 aregood. There are fewthreatsemanatingfrom outside Washington.

In a causticrulingwritten byJamesWynn, an appel-late judge nominated byBarackObama,the courtfound thatthe state’scurrentmap—which letRepublicanswin ten ofthestate’s13 districtswith just53% ofthe totaloverall vote—was“motivated byinvidiouspartisan intent”, and violated the ﬁrst and14th Amendments. North Carolina vowedto appeal, which could see the case addedto two othergerrymanderingsuitsattheSupreme Court. The head ofNorth Caroli-na’sRepublican Partyaccused MrWynn of“waginga personal, partisan waron NorthCarolina Republicans.”IfRepublicansgettheirway, Democrat-appointed judgeslike MrWynn will sooncomprise a smallershare ofthe federal ju-diciary. No presidenthasconﬁrmed morefederal appellate judges(12) in hisﬁrstyearthan Donald Trump. He hasalso seen sixfederal district-courtjudgesconﬁrmed,and one Supreme Courtjustice, Neil Gor-such. Another47 nomineesawaitconﬁr-mation; 102 more federal judgeshipsre-main open forMrTrump to ﬁll. With twoofthe Supreme Court’sliberal justices, anditsone unpredictable member(AnthonyKennedy) aged 79 orolder, the presidentmaygetto name anotherjustice, cement-ingthe Court’sconservative bent.MrTrump’staxreform, penchantforderegulation and foreign-policydirectioncould all be reversed bythe nextpresident.Butbecause federal judgesserve forlife,the largelyyoungconservativeswhom MrTrump hasplaced on the bench will havean impacton American life and lawthatlongoutlastshisadministration.The federal judiciaryisorganised into12 regional circuitsand the nine-memberSupreme Court. Around 400,000 casesareﬁled yearlyin the federal system, whichhasaround 1,700 judges. Each ofthese cir-cuitshasseveral districtcourts(there are 94in all), which hearcivil and criminal feder-al cases, and one appellate court(there are13: one foreach circuitand the appellatecourtforthe federal circuit), which hearsappealsagainstdecisionsmade byfederaldistrictcourtsand agencies. Because theSupreme Courthearsso fewcases, federalappellate courtsdeﬁne mostcontestedmattersoffederal law.Everypresidentleaveshismarkon thefederal bench, butMrTrump’swill be larg-erthan most, fortwo reasons. First, SenateRepublicansconﬁrmed fewerjudgesin Ba-rackObama’slasttwo years(22) than inanytwo-yearperiod since 1951-52. MrObama leftoﬃce with 107 federal judge-shipsstill vacant—includingMrGorsuch’sseat, held open because Senate Republi-cansrefused to give MerrickGarland, MrObama’snominee, a hearing. Thiswasmore than twice the numberGeorge W.Bush had athispresidency’send. Second,in 2013 Senate Democratseliminated theﬁlibusterforlower-courtnominees, whichmeansjudgescan be conﬁrmed with asimple majorityvote, ratherthan the 60 re-quired to breaka ﬁlibuster. Formany con-servatives, thisopportunityalone—ratherthan fearoflettingHillaryClinton exploitit—justiﬁed theirsupportforMrTrump.He hasnotdisappointed. The ditheringand incompetence thathave deﬁned muchofhistenure have been absentfrom his ju-dicial-selection process. Some argue thatthe administration and Senate are pushingtoo manynomineesthrough too quickly,butthatistheirprerogative: senators canslowthe processiftheyfeel steamrollered.MrTrump hasnominated orthodoxcon-servativeswhom the Republican-con-trolled Senate hashappilyconﬁrmed. Duringhiscampaign, MrTrump prom-ised thatthe judgeshe nominated wouldbe “all picked bythe FederalistSociety”,America’sleadingorganisation ofconser-vative and libertarian lawyers. Manyof hisnomineeshave tiesto the group, asdo MrGorsuch and Don McGahn, the president’scounsel. MrMcGahn told a FederalistSoci-etygatheringin Novemberthatthe admin-istration wanted to nominate “strongandsmartjudges…committed originalistsandtextualists[who] possessthe fortitude toenforce the rule oflaw”. MrTrump’snomi-nees, he crowed, “all have papertrails…th-ere isnothingunknown aboutthem.”Thatlistofqualitiescontainssubtle digsatthe two typesofjudgesconservativeswantto avoid. The ﬁrst, embodied by Da-vid Souter, whom George H.W. Bush ap-pointed, isthe nominee with a thin recordon constitutional issueswho turnsliberalon the bench. John Roberts, the currentchiefjustice, exempliﬁesthe second type:manyconservativesderide him asasquishyinstitutionalistwho caved in topublicpressure when he twice voted to up-hold the Aﬀordable Care Act.The maturingofthe conservative legalmovement, which wasin itsinfancywhenMrBush picked MrSouterin 1990, and thestrength ofitspipeline and networks, hasmade wild-card nomineeslesslikely, par-ticularlyunderMrTrump, who appearshappyto be guided bythe “Federalistpeo-ple”. Thatdoesnotmean, ofcourse, thatpresidentsknowhowjudgeswill vote oneach issue forever. ButRepublican judicialnomineesshare a legal philosophythat issceptical ofexecutive and federal powerand inclined towards“originalism”, whichinterpretsthe constitution’smeaningnar-rowly, asitwould have been understoodwhen itwaswritten.Republicanslike originalistsfor variousreasons. Social conservativesbelieve liber-al justicesinventconstitutional justiﬁca-tionsforsociallyprogressive rulings suchasthose on abortion and gaymarriage,while businesstypesappreciate original-ists’ scepticism ofgovernmentregulation.Conservative judgesvieworiginalism asan essential bulwarkagainstthe judicialand presidential usurpation oflegislativepowers. Liberalsbelieve such a philoso-phyhinderssocial progress. Theywillhave ample opportunityto testthatthe-ory: a federal judiciarystocked with origi-nalistjudgeswill be hostile to an ambi-tiousfederal government. ThatsuitsRepublicanswell, butcould frustrateDemocratsfordecadesto come.7The judiciaryFull-courtpressWASHINGTON, DCDonald Trump’s judicial appointments mayprove his mostenduring legacy30UnitedStatesThe EconomistJanuary13th20181Attention-seekingAll the president’s tweetsTHE president’sdearestsupportersand bitterestopponentsare united intheirwish thatlessattention be paid tohissocial-media habit.

To be fair, none could be enactedbyexecutive ﬁatalone. Aborderwallwould require appropriationsfrom Con-gress. HillaryClinton could be jailed onlybya stubbornlyindependentjustice sys-tem. On the businessofswamp-draining,however, there ismuch thatthe executivebranch could do on itsown. YetWashing-ton remainsasboggyasever.Lobbyistsare a hardyspecies, capableofsurvivingboth the lean yearsofgridlockand the feedingfrenziesofuniﬁed govern-ment. Theythrive when policyisin ﬂux,preservingold perksand pushingfornewones. “The honestansweristhatthe inﬂu-ence industrygrewalmostasmuch inTrump’sﬁrstyearasitdid in Obama’s,”saysone long-time lobbyist. Notall lobby-ingactivityin 2017 hasyetbeen reported—butitmaywell be the mostproﬁtable todate, given the ﬂurryofactivityaround thepassage ofthe taxbill in December, whichwasa swampyaﬀair. The bill wascraftedin secretand rushed through; Democraticsenatorshad to receive theircopies, withsome amendmentshandwritten, fromlobbyingﬁrmsinstead offrom theirRe-publican colleagues. Although MrTrumphad promised to close the loophole for car-ried-intereston private-equityinvest-ments, thatone survived. The bill wasplump with newgoodies: alcohol excisetaxeswere cutby16%, forexample.Partofthe problem liesin congressio-nal incapacity. Undera more normal ad-ministration, the White House would set aclearpolicyagenda and Congresswouldrespond. MrTrump haslargelyabrogatedthisrole. Mitch McConnell, the Senate ma-jorityleader, supposedlyonce said that thepresidentwill “sign anythingwe putinfrontofhim”. Aswell asmanagingtheirfractiousbackbenchers, Republican lead-ersmustalso juggle policy-crafting. Theirabilityto do so hasbeen diminished by along-term decline in the numberofem-ployeesin agencieslike the GovernmentAccountabilityOﬃce, Congressional Re-search Service and Congressional BudgetOﬃce, which are charged with providingunbiased information to members. Theirstaﬀnumbershave fallen by40% since1979. Within Congress, lowsalariesensurethatstaﬀersremain youngand inexperi-enced: more than halfare under30. In theHouse ofRepresentatives, the typical legis-lative director, a seniorpost, isonly 31, ac-cordingto data crunched forThe EconomistbyLegistorm, a congressional monitoringservice.

Fundingforthe Missile Defence Agen-cy(MDA) islikelyto exceed $11bn for2018,over$3bn more than the president’sorigi-nal request(assumingCongresscan comeup with a deal on the overall budget). Anemergencyrequestofnearly$5bn foraddi-tional “missile defence and defeat” fund-ingwasmade in November.The intelligence agencieshad assuredMrTrump when he tookoﬃce thatnot un-til 2020, possiblyeven 2022, would MrKimhave a reliable intercontinental ballisticmissile (ICBM). Thatrelativelycomfortingassessmentwasblown apartin JulywhenNorth Korea successfullytested two mis-sileswith the range to hitcitiesin the con-tinental United States, and, in September,when itconducted an underground explo-sion ofwhatappearsto have been a ther-monucleardevice.Since then, the priorityhasbeen to reas-sure Americansthattheycan be protectedfrom MrKim—whom MrTrump’snationalsecurityadviser, H.R. McMaster, hasalarmingly(and withoutevidence) de-scribed as“undeterrable”. In October, MrTrump boasted to Sean HannityofFoxNews: “We have missilesthatcan knockouta missile in the air97% ofthe time, andifyousend two ofthem, it’sgoingto getknocked out.” Mostmissile expertswerehorriﬁed bythe president’sblithe conﬁ-dence in the eﬀectivenessofthe only mis-sile-defence system, known asground-based mid-course defence (GMD), thatisintended to shield the United Statesfrom alimited ballistic-missile attack. They fearMrTrump maypersuade himselfthatapre-emptive attackon North Korea wouldbe risk-free, atleastforAmerica. Asfarbackasthe wildlyover-ambi-tiousReagan-era strategicdefence initia-tive (“StarWars”), missile defence hasbeenasmuch an aspiration asa policy, accord-ingto Michael Elleman, a formermissileengineernowatthe International InstituteforStrategicStudies. Local and regionalsystems, such asPatriotmissiles, the ship-based Aegisand THAAD(Terminal HighAltitude Area Defence), have become eﬀec-tive. ButGMD, which hasto hita much fast-ermovingtargetfrom furtheraway, has notprogressed to the same extent. In the wake ofthe September11th 2001attacks, the Bush administration needed aresponse to the growingthreatofballistic-missile technologyproliferatingto “rogue”regimes, such asIran, Iraq and North Ko-rea. Consequently, the GMDwasquicklycobbled togetherwith a mixture ofold andnewtechnologyand hurriedlycommis-sioned in 2004. Today’sGMDand itsasso-ciated systemsspan 15 time zones, com-prise seven diﬀerenttypesofsensors (onland, atsea and in space) and 44 intercep-tors, each costing$75m, deployed atmili-tarybasesin Alaska and California. GMDisdesigned to track, interceptand destroyan incomingnuclearwarhead outside theearth’satmosphere through the force ofthe collision alone.Yeteven now, after$40bn hasbeen in-vested in it, GMDstill hasthe hallmarks ofan immature system. Tom Karako, a mis-sile-defence analystatthe Centre for Strate-gicand International Studies, concedesthatmanyofthe improvementsthatwereplanned and expected have notyetcometo pass. GMD’sinterceptorshave been test-ed 18 times, succeedingon ten ofthem. InMaylastyear, a successful intercept wascarried outforthe ﬁrsttime against an in-tercontinental ballisticmissile ofthe kindMrKim would need to reach the westcoast. Butthree outoffourprevious testshad ended in failure.MrTrump’s97%-success-rate claim ap-pearsto be based on a misunderstandingofthe MDA’sarithmetic. The actual “singleshotprobabilityofkill” ofGMDintercep-torsis56%. The MDAhastaken 60% asitsbenchmarkand calculated thatiffour in-terceptorswere launched atone warhead,the kill probabilitywould rise to 97%. How-ever, JamesActon, who workson nuclearpolicyatthe Carnegie EndowmentforIn-ternational Peace, questionsthis. “Ifoneinterceptorfailsbecause ofa design ormanufacturingﬂaw,” he pointsout, “theothersmayfail too because theyhave thesame problem.”Moreover, testsuccesseshave been un-derideal conditions. With justa few min-utes’ reaction time and faced with severalincomingmissiles, each equipped withmultiple decoys, some “leakage” isalmostinevitable, thinksMrElleman. Whatshould the missile-defence re-viewrecommend? MrActon thinksitmaygo fora bigincrease in the numberof inter-ceptorsbased in Alaska—perhapsup to100. Buthe questionswhetherthatwouldreallyimprove capability, because of thesystem’sinherentﬂaws.Anotherpossibilityisspeedingup thedeploymentofthe Multi-ObjectKill Vehi-cle, which would give each interceptormissile multiple shotsatincomingwar-headsand isdue to be readyin 2025. Amore radical option would be to developsolid-state laserssmall enough to be car-ried bydrones, which would ﬂyclose to anenemycountryand kill missilesin theirvulnerable boostphase. Thatmaybe a de-cade away. In the meantime, someoneshould explain to MrTrump that, atleastforthe foreseeable future, there isno cer-tain defence ofthe homeland againstevenafairlylimited ballistic-missile attack. 7Missile defenceThe otherkind ofleakingThere is no guaranteed defence againstMrKim’s missiles—yetagainstbusinessinterests. Energyﬁrmscould have no betterfriend than ScottPruitt, the head ofthe Environmental Pro-tection Agency, who haszealouslyover-turned rulesin theirfavour. All the whiletransparencyinitiatives, like the publica-tion ofWhite House visitorlogs, have beenrolled back. MrTrump’spersonal conﬂictsofinterestare hard to knowgiven his refus-al to release histaxreturns. Populist gover-nance thisisnot.Presidentsofall stripeshave pledged totackle inﬂuence-peddling, usuallywith lit-tle success. BarackObama’sattemptstohaltthe revolvingdoorbetween public of-ﬁce and private gain were ineﬀective. Be-cause America hasa well-developed mar-ketforinﬂuence, supply-side restrictionsissued bythe White House are unlikely toﬁxmatters. ForMrTrump, thisneed not beahindrance: he issure to boastthat he hasdrained the swamp in 2020 anyway.732UnitedStatesThe EconomistJanuary13th2018ANYpolitical system thatputsgreat pow-erin the handsofa single person mustalso reckon with the problem thatcreates.Itissensible to make provision to removethe kingorpresidentfrom oﬃce ifhe be-comesincapacitated. Yetthe existence ofsuch a provision also risksinvitinga coup.The framersofthe constitution were acute-lyaware ofthis, and decided to fudge it.Meanwhile, in Britain, George III’sboutsofmania invited questionsaboutwho isreal-lyin charge when the monarch ison thethrone butoutofhismind. SpeculationaboutPresidentDonald Trump’smentalstate, ever-presentsince before hiselec-tion, increased when he tweeted thathisnuclearbutton was“much bigger” thanKim Jong-Un’s. BeingMrTrump, he fol-lowed up with hisown self-analysis, de-claringthathe isa “verystable genius”.Mostpsychiatristsare waryabout pro-nouncingon the mental state ofpeopletheyhave notexamined, butthathasnotstopped a fewfrom havinga go atMrTrump. BandyLee, a psychiatristatYaleand editorofa bookcalled “The Danger-ousCase ofDonald Trump”, briefed mem-bersofCongressbefore Christmas. Morethan 50 Democratshave signed up to a billto compel the 45th presidentto submittoan examination ofhisﬁtnessforoﬃce.Speculation aboutwhatison the presi-dent’smind beginswith assertionsthat hemightbe in the earlystagesofdementia.Those who argue thisbegin with the ob-servation thatthe president’sfatherhadAlzheimer’sdisease. Thatisnot, byitself,strongevidence. There isa version of Alz-heimer’sthatisalmostguaranteed to bepassed on from parentto child, butit tendsto showup in people in their40sand 50s.The otherstrainsare lessstronglyherita-ble, meaningfamilyhistoryisa useful partofa diagnosis, butnotmore than that.Then there are observationsbased onthe president’suse oflanguage. When tran-scribed, MrTrump’sextempore speechesare unusuallyjumbled. Butthatmight al-wayshave been the case: itishard to be cer-tain because hisvoluminouspublishedwritingswere ghostwritten bysomeoneelse. Becominglesslucid when speaking isafairlynormal partofageing. Researchersreportthattip-of-the-tongue moments,when a speakerstrugglesto ﬁnd the wordhe islookingfor, become more frequentwith each passingdecade.In theoryitwould be possible to takethe president’sspeech patterns, run themthrough software and then compare thechange overtime with whatmightbe ex-pected aspartofnormal ageing. (Doctorshave been through George III’scorrespon-dence and found thathe had periodsof ex-treme logorrhoea when he wasunwell,writingsentencesconsistingof400 wordswith onlyeightverbs.) There are two pro-blemswith this. First, there isno estab-lished baseline forwhatnormal ageinglookslike. Second, MrTrump’schangesofcareer, from propertydeveloperto TVstarto presidential candidate, would naturallylead to a change in howhe useswords. Apropertestforearly-stage dementia wouldrequire several diﬀerenttypesofbrainscan, reasoning, memoryand genetictests.In the viewofa leadingresearcherwhorunsan institute dedicated to earlydiagno-sisand treatmentofdementia, itwould be“highlyirresponsible” to diagnose anyoneon language use alone.Ifthe evidence fordementia isthin,whataboutthatotherfrequentdiagnosis—thatthe presidenthasnarcissisticperso-nalitydisorder(NPD)? The checklistforthissyndrome in the fourth edition of theDiagnosticand Statistical Manual (DSM)includes: “hasa grandiose sense ofself-im-portance”, “ispreoccupied byfantasies ofunlimited success”, “believesthathe orshe isspecial and unique”, “requiresexces-sive admiration” and has“unreasonableexpectationsofespeciallyfavourable treat-mentorautomaticcompliance with his orherexpectations”. Thatmightsound famil-iar. “I alone can ﬁxit,” MrTrump declaredathisnominatingconvention in 2016. JohnOldham ofBaylorCollege ofMedicine,who presided overthe compilation ofthechaptersin DSM-5 on personalitydisor-ders, saysthatthe president’sbehaviour(especiallyhisexaggerated need foradmi-ration and praise) “reﬂectsthingswe see inpeople with NPD”.YetDrOldham also cautionsthata lotofsuccessful people have a touch ofnarcis-sism. Whathe calls“healthynarcissism”tipsoverinto disorderterritorywhen itim-pedesa person’sabilityto form normalbondswith otherpeople. Bywayofexam-ple, DrOldham mentionsa patientwhoseidea ofmeaningful interaction with familymemberswasto give extravagantgifts.Thisman soughthelp afterhisson attempt-ed to commitsuicide and hiswife threat-ened to leave him. Unlike asthma, peoplewho have NPDdo notthinktheyhave it,and there are no drugsrecommended fortreatment. Unlike dementia, itneed notimpairmemoryorbasicreasoning.WhateverMrTrump isthinkingabout,he isa longwayfrom 25th-Amendmentter-ritory. Thisisthe provision ofthe constitu-tion added in 1967, afterWoodrowWil-son’sstrokes, DwightEisenhower’sheartattacksand John F. Kennedy’sassassina-tion. Clause three ofthe amendmentcov-erswhathappenswhen the presidentknowshe will be unconscious; ithasbeenused three times, once when Ronald Rea-gan underwentmedical proceduresandtwice when George W. Bush did so.Clause fourisdesigned to deal withcaseswhere the presidentisso out-of-itthathe isunable to hand overauthority.Again, clause four’sauthorswere notspe-ciﬁcaboutwhatmightlegitimatelytriggerit, and theyworried aboutcoups. Butclause fourseemsdesigned fora situationwhere the presidentiseitherrendered un-conscious, oriswanderingaround theWhite House unable to recognise hisownreﬂection. Even then, to make the 25thAmendmentstickstill requiressuper-ma-joritiesin both housesofCongress.The rush to diagnose the presidentmightbe taken asevidence ofTrump-de-rangementsyndrome: the president’scrit-icsﬁnd him so maddeningthathe drivesthem to despair. There isalso a mild ironyhere, ofa kind thatpartisan thinking oftenthrowsup. Left-leaningadvocatesfor morehumane treatmentofthe mentallyill tendto argue thatmental illnessisa normal partofhuman experience, and thata touch ofone disorderorotheroughtnotto disquali-fysomeone from doingan importantjob(depressed pilotsand epilepticlorry-driv-ersaside). Yetleft-leaningcriticsof the pres-identare, in thiscase, arguingthat heshould be declared incapable.There are plentyofreasonsto think thatMrTrump isill-suited to the presidency.These have become more apparentoverthe pastyear, butall were there before hiselection. Madnesshaslittle to do with it.7Diagnosing from a distanceWhat’s on the president’s mindThe Trump presidencyis nowhere near25th-AmendmentterritoryThe EconomistJanuary13th2018 UnitedStates33AFANofmilitaryhistory, Stephen Bannon mayknowofNike-phoros, a Byzantine emperorwho wasvanquished and de-capitated bya Bulgarkhan who, forextra humiliation, then fash-ioned hisskull into a drinkingcup. PresidentDonald Trump’serstwhile muse mighteven feel he hasexperienced somethingsimilar, atthe end ofa weekin which he hasbeen denouncedand excommunicated bythe president, jettisoned byhisconser-vative benefactor, Rebekah Mercer, and, on January9th, shuntedfrom hisposition atthe helm ofBreitbartNews, a hard-right web-site which gained huge exposure from hisformersuccess. Thesame day, in a jaw-droppingtelevised meetingwith congressio-nal leaders, MrTrump airilysuggested he mightsupport a pack-age ofliberal immigration reforms. Thiswasthe modern-dayequivalentofsuppingfrom MrBannon’sgilded skull.The spurto hisdemise wasMrBannon’slead role in brieﬁngMichael Wolﬀ, authorofthe caustictakedown ofthe Trump ad-ministration, “Fire and Fury”, thathastitillated Washington andenraged the president. MrBannon oﬀended especiallyby de-scribinga meetingbetween Russian operativesand members ofthe Trump campaign team, includingthe president’seldestsonand son-in-law, as“treasonous”, “unpatriotic” and “bad shit”.The Trump team had previouslydismissed itasa non-event. YetMrBannon’sastonishingrise to, arguably, the second-most-pow-erful position in America, and precipitousfall need to be under-stood more broadly, especiallybythe Republican Party.He had terrible ﬂawsand American politicsis, fornow atleast,well-rid ofhim. YetMrBannon waslargelymotivated by hiscon-cern foran issue ofexistential importance to Republicans: a wid-eninggulfbetween theirmainstream leadersand the disaﬀectedwhite working-classsupporterswho representa bigchunk oftheirsupport. Given power, on the coat-tailsofa victory forMrTrump thathe did much to bringabout, MrBannon had an op-portunityto narrowthatgap, and therebytransform America’spolitical landscape. He blewitspectacularly, formany reasons,includinghubris, the intemperance ofhischaracter, the nastinessofhistacticsand the incoherence ofhisideas. The gulf persists.And ifthe Republicanslearn nothingfrom MrBannon’smissedopportunity, theywill suﬀerforit.Unlike MrTrump, MrBannon isintellectuallycurious, ob-sessed with historyand well-read. Like hisformerpatron, he isasuccessful man ofrough-edged stock, who spentyearstrespass-ingin elite circles: in MrTrump’scase, Manhattan society, in MrBannon’s, Goldman Sachsand Hollywood. Thatperhapshelpsexplain theirmain pointofconvergence—a resentful conviction,which MrBannon suggestscame to him aftera spell in Asia, thatworking-classAmericanshave been screwed byimmigration,globalisation and adventuristforeign policiesperpetuated byboth parties, atthe biddingofthe fat-catdonorswho have bene-ﬁted from them the most.There isplainlysome truth to that; economicdisruption andwage stagnation, in partfuelled byglobalisation, are the centralproblem ofrich democracies. Lamentably, none ofMrTrump’sand MrBannon’smain solutions, an “America First” mixofbor-dercontrols, protectionism and isolationism, provide a convinc-inganswerto it. YetMrBannon, unlike MrTrump, who is proba-blymore fussed aboutthe stockmarketthan working-classAmericans, hasattimesbroached more imaginative ﬁxes.Forexample, he hasespoused betterunion representation forworkers, highertaxeson the rich and a crackdown on corporatetax-dodging. He also hasa well-judged sense thatifthe Republi-cans, manyofwhom would considersuch stepsheretical, couldonlyﬁnd answersto working-classeconomicgrievancestheymightrule, in a culturallyconservative country, almost untram-melled. Thatisa sortofimagination and ambition the Americanright, held captive byitsdonors, badlyneeds. The trouble is, MrBannon’srecord in and since leavinggov-ernmenthasbeen so dismal and self-defeatingasto discredit hisviewsand even hisvalues. Manyofhispolicyproposals, espe-ciallythose mostchallengingto conservatives, would require bi-partisan support. Yethe dedicated himselfto oﬀending the leftatall costs—thus, forexample, hisdisastrousearlyattempt ata Mus-lim travel ban, timed, on a Fridayevening, to cause maximumdistressto unwittingtravellers. And so, too, in hissupport forMrTrump’sbaﬄingequivocationson the white supremacist vio-lence thatrocked Charlottesville lastyear.“Race-baiting” is still race-baitingMrBannon justiﬁed hisdivisive methodsin Machiavellianterms—arguingthatoutraged liberalswould lurch everfurther tothe unelectable left. Yetthe Democrats, ridinga wave of revulsionwith MrTrump’sand MrBannon’schauvinism, have insteadwon mostrecentelections—includingin Alabama’sSenate race,where the self-consciouslyintellectual MrBannon disgracedhimselfbystumpingfora lasciviousphilistine.MrBannon’sincessantanti-establishmentscheming, includ-ingmanoeuvresagainstPaul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, hasmeanwhile prevented him interestingalmostanymainstreamRepublican in hisnovel ideas, exceptsometimesthe president,who nowsayshe isinsane. Republican leadersinstead executedataxreform so loaded forthe rich thatitisunclearwhether theywill even campaign on itahead ofthe mid-term elections.ThushasMrBannon, followingand enablingMrTrump,helped infecthispartywith a cultural populism in which racismand authoritarianism thrive, and to which the president, despitehisconciliatorywordson immigration, will probablyreturn. Atthe same time, he hasdone nothingto bringaboutan urgently re-quired reappraisal ofthe Republicans’ stale economicagenda. In-deed, bydiscreditingradicalism with hisperformance, he hasprobablymade itlesslikely. He will notbe missed.7Banished BannonStephen Bannon had a chance to make American politics better.

ButasChileansawaithisarrival onJanuary15th fora three-dayvisit, followedbytwo daysin Peru, the preparations havehighlighted the increasingirrelevance ofthe Catholicchurch to manyChileans.HalfofChileansregard the visitasof littleimportance and a large majoritydisap-prove ofthe governmentcontributing7bnpesos($11m) towardssecurityand logistics.“The moneyshould be spenton the poor,above all on health,” fumesSonia Meza, anevangelical who worksasa maid, from LaFlorida, a suburb ofSantiago.The lackofenthusiasm contrastswiththe ecstaticreception ofJohn Paul II in 1987,duringthe 17-yeardictatorship ofAugustoPinochet. Then, more than three-quartersofChileanswere Catholic. The church wasrespected foritsstaunch defence ofhumanrightsand the visitwasused to rally oppo-sition to Pinochet. Ahymn written by lo-calsforthe occasion, “Messengeroflife, pil-grim ofpeace”, followed John Paulwhereverhe went. Overthe three interveningdecades,trustin the Catholicchurch hasdeclineddramatically, accordingto surveysby Lat-inobarómetro, a pollster(see chart). Lessthan halfofChileansnowcall themselvesCatholics, a ﬁgure thatwill shockmany. Anannual surveybythe CatholicUniversity’sCentre forPublicPolicy, which usesaslightlydiﬀerentmethodology, comes upwith a ﬁgure ofclose to 60% and showsCa-tholicism fallingmore slowly. The Catholicchurch hasbeen losing ad-herentsacrossLatin America. Butin othercountriespeople are shiftingmainlytoevangelical churches. The same trend isvisible amongpoorerand lesseducatedChileans. WhatmarksChile outisthe be-haviourofitsricherand better-educatedyoungsters. Elsewhere in the region, theyare stayingwith Catholicism; in Chile theyare abandoningfaith altogether. “There isan advanced and fairlyrapid processofsecularisation” in Chile, saysIgnacio Irar-rázaval ofthe Centre forPublicPolicy.In partthisisbecause Chile isthe re-gion’srichestcountry, and itsmostopeneconomy. Thathasfacilitated the spread ofsocial trendsfrom outside Latin America. Itisalso because ofrevelationsaboutthesexual abuse ofchildren bypriests.

OnJanuary23rd itwill invite Canadianstodisclose theircannabishabitsanonymous-lythrough an app. Itsnosinessisentirelyprofessional. Canada’sgovernment, led byJustin Trudeau, plansto legalise the recre-ational use ofcannabisbyJuly1st. StatCanneedsreliable data in orderto incorporatethe newlyrespectable consumer-goodssectorinto national accounts. Eversince MrTrudeausaid during theelection campaign in 2015 thata Liberalgovernmentwould legalise marijuana,discussion hasfocused on who would beauthorised to sell itand whatlevel of gov-ernmentwould getthe moneyfrom can-nabistaxes. Governmentdepartmentsincharge ofhealth, tax, securityand othersare changingproceduresand reassigningbureaucratsto prepare forlegalisation.StatCan hasan especiallytrickyjob. Ithasto estimate the contribution to theeconomymade bythe production, distri-bution and sale ofcannabis. To do that itmustknowwhatthe cannabiseconomylooked like when lightingup wasa crime.The lasttime Canada dealtwith anythinglike thiswasin the 1920s, when prohibitionended and the Dominion BureauofStatis-ticskeptthe national accounts. “We can’tasnational accountantsjustputin a numberpost-legalisation,” saysJim Tebrake, the StatCan oﬃcial in chargeofaccountingforcannabis. Thatwouldmake itlooklike the economyhad got asudden boostfrom activitythatwasal-readygoingon illicitly. To avoid that, theagencyneedsto publish data goingback to1961, the base yearforthe accounts. Itwillincorporate the data into the oﬃcial ﬁguresonce itisconﬁdenttheyare reliable. WhileUruguayand several American states, in-cludingCalifornia, have legalised canna-bis, Canada’sstatisticiansare usingneithercountryasa model. Once Canadianscangetlegallybombed, measuringthe worthofindulgence will geteasier. Justhuntingforpastdata can be risky, asaresearcherin Parliament’sbudgetoﬃcediscovered. The legislature’stechnologyunitspotted thathe waslookingatweedywebsitesand amassingﬁlesoffragrantdata and shutdown hiscomputeraccount.He had to persuade the in-house detectivesthathisworkwaslegitimate. Production isthe mostdiﬃcultpart ofthe cannabisvalue chain to measure. “Theproducersare harderto ﬁnd than the cus-tomers,” saysMrTebrake. Thatismainlybecause, unlesstheygrowthe stuﬀfor thelegal medical-marijuana market, theyaremainlycareercriminals. In the UnitedStates, undercoveragentssometimescol-lectdata on production. Canada relies oninformation from police and borderoﬃ-cialson seizuresofcannabis. Butthosedata depend on whetherthe traﬃckers orthe police getluckyin a given year. Health surveysbyStatCan and otheragenciesare one wayto measure con-sumption, butpeople do notalwaystellthe truth aboutsuch habits. To arrive atadollarvalue forthe market, statisticiansneed information aboutprice, too. Stat-Can, alongwith otheragencies, hasturnedto priceofweed.com, where usersanony-mouslypostthe amount, price and loca-tion oftheirpurchases. The sample is farfrom perfect. The data come from just onesource, and people who poston priceof-weed.com maynotbe representative. Thewebsite listsjustthe 15 mostrecentbuysforeach location. To getaround thatproblem, StatCanlooked atinformation gleaned byDarkCrawler, a piece ofsoftware thatcan roamthe web in search ofpriceofweed’spastdata. To go furtherbackin time, itis gather-ingdata collected byacademics, includingLuca Giommoni, an expertin illicitmar-ketsfrom CardiﬀUniversityin Britain, andDavid Décary-Hétuofthe UniversityofMontreal. StatCan’scrowdsourcingappwill supplementratherthan replace thepriceofweed information.On the dayStatCan releasesthe app, itwill publish itsﬁrstestimatesofthe canna-biseconomydatingbackto 1961on a newcannabishub. Itwill have a space for any-one to suggestmore accurate data. If peo-ple thinkthe price istoo low, theywill beable to suggesttweaks, which would raisethe value ofthe cannabiseconomy. Peopleon the streethave a lotofinformation, saysMrTebrake. (Iftheycan rememberit.)Parliament’sbudgetoﬃce made a ﬁrststab atestimatingthe size ofthe market: itguessed thatin 2018 Canadianswouldspend C$4.2bn-6.2bn ($3.4bn-5bn) on can-nabis, orabout0.2% ofGDP. Thatisa littlelessthan theyspend on beer. Before incor-poratingitsestimatesinto national ac-counts, StatCan hasto ﬁgure outhowmuch existingactivity, such aselectricityused byillicit“grow-ops”, isbeingused inthe cannabiseconomy.Afterlegalisation, StatCan plans to ask10,000 householdseverythree monthshowtheirbehaviourhaschanged. “We seeitalmostasourstatistical dutyto try to de-velop a data setto measure thisevent,”saysMrTebrake. The agency’sworkmighthelp othercountriescontemplatinglegali-sation ofblackmarkets. The more smokersdistorttheirperceptionsofreality, the lessstatisticianscan aﬀord to do so. 7Legal weedStatCannabisOTTAWAGovernmentaccounts startto measurethe cannabis economyThe EconomistJanuary13th201839For daily analysis and debate on the Middle Eastand Africa, visitEconomist.com/world/middle-east-africa 1“MYDAUGHTERwasthe ﬁrstto die,”saysMaria Phehla, pullingherthin yellowjerseytight, asifto contain thegriefconsumingherbirdlike frame. “Itwasapainful death.”Itwasalso an untimelyand needlessone. MsPhehla’sdaughter, Deborah, was46 yearsold when she died justthree daysafterSouth Africa’shealth authoritiesmoved herfrom a specialised mental-health hospital to an unlicensed charity.Deborah, who wasmentallyimpaired,“died alone, locked up in an outbuilding[when] she choked on herown blood,”saysMsPhehla (pictured above). An au-topsyfound thatherstomach containedtwo lumpsofhard plastic, each the size ofaﬁst, and ballsofbrown paper. “She wasstarving,” saysMsPhehla. “She ate what-everwasin the room.”Deborah’sdeath mayhave been theﬁrst, butitwasfarfrom the lastin whatlaw-yersare callingSouth Africa’sworsthu-man-rightsabuse since the end ofapart-heid.

Manywere tied up, bundledmoved withoutthe families’ consentortofacilitiesthatwere notasgood asLife Esidi-meni. Yet, justa fewmonthslater, the gov-ernmentbroke itspromise, movingpa-tientsso quicklyand shambolicallythatmanywere sentwithoutmedicinesormedical records. So chaoticwasthe movethatthe authoritieslosttrackofmany ofthe patients: 59 are still missing, and nineofthe dead have notbeen identiﬁed. The transferofpatientswasostensiblyaimed atsavingmoney. Butan investiga-tion bythe health ombudsman, a publicwatchdog, concluded thatitwould proba-blydrive up costs. Ideological hostility tofor-proﬁtcorporations(such asLife Esidi-meni) mayhave played a role. Butitcannotexplain whypatientswere handed over tocharitiesthatwere so plainlyunsuitable. The tragedyisfarfrom unique. “Al-though youwon’tﬁnd anythingelse onthisscale, we hearreportson a daily basisofmini-Esidimeni scandalsaround thecountry,” saysMarkHeywood, one ofthefoundersofSection 27, an advocacygroupthatwentto courtto tryto stop patients be-ingmoved.

Such caseshighlighta widerfailure inthe health service because of“corruption,abreakdown ofaccountabilityand a cul-ture ofimpunity[within government]”,saysMrHeywood. There wasample evi-dence ofall thisatthe hearingsinto Life Esi-dimeni, where a stringofsenioroﬃcialshave blamed othersforthe tragedy.

South Africa isone ofthe continent’srichestand mostadvanced countries. Butthe mental-health scandal illustrates itsgovernment’sdeepestﬂaw. Partsofthestate have been so hollowed outbycrony-ism and corruption underthe presidencyofJacob Zuma thattheyfail woefully tolookafteritsmostvulnerable people.

Even ifthatisan underestimate, itfallsfar shortofthe scale ofprotestsnine yearsago, whenhundredsofthousandsdemonstratedagainsta ﬁshyelection. Still, the unrest hasspooked the regime, in partbecause de-monstratorscalled fora complete changeofgovernment. The response wasforceful.More than 20 people were killed. Areform-istMPsaysthat3,700 were arrested.The regime and countriesin the Westare nowponderingtheirnextsteps. OnJanuary9th Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,Iran’ssupreme leader(pictured), blamedAmerica and Britain forthe protests; hisof-ﬁcialsclaim to have evidence thattheywere directed from abroad. “Thiswon’tbeleftwithouta response,” he said on Twitter.Butso farthe governmenthasonlybannedthe teachingofEnglish in primaryschools,warningofa “cultural invasion”.The regime hasacknowledged home-grown problems, too. MrKhamenei saysthe protesters’ grievances“mustbe dealtwith and heard”. Hassan Rouhani, thepresident, hasgone further, arguingthatthe unrestwasdue to cultural and social re-strictionsimposed byclerics. He blamed“the gap between oﬃcialsand youngpeo-ple”. Buthe maystruggle to close it: hispresidencyhasbeen riven with inﬁghting,and the hardlinerswho wield real powerdistrusthim. The governmentmayinsteadfocuson areaswhere there isagreement,such asshuttingdown illicitcreditinstitu-tions, manyofwhich have gone bust, wip-ingoutordinaryIranians’ deposits.Donald Trump hailed the protesters for“ﬁnallyactingagainstthe brutal and cor-ruptIranian regime”. Butsome in Americaand Europe fearthatembracingthedissi-dentswill undermine them. Similarthink-ingled BarackObama to keep mum in2009. Even then, the regime accused prot-estersofbeingforeign agents. ThistimeEuropean governmentskeptquietfornear-lya weekafterthe ﬁrstsignsofunrest.When Federica Mogherini, the EuropeanUnion’sforeign-policychief, ﬁnally brokehersilence, itwasonlyto call forrestraint.Emmanuel Macron, France’spresident,criticised America and itsMiddle Easternalliesforloudlysupportingthe protesters.The EUhasa largerconcern: the fate ofthe nucleardeal between Iran and sixworld powers. Afteryearsofpainstakingdiplomacy, the agreement, signed in 2015,imposed limitson Iran’snuclearpro-gramme in exchange forrelieffrom sanc-tions. Iran islargelykeepingup its end ofthe bargain, saysthe International AtomicEnergyAgency(IAEA), which inspectsitsnuclearfacilities. In OctoberMrTrumpnonethelessrefused to certifyitscompli-ance, ashe mustdo everythree months. AsThe Economistwentto press, he faced an-otherdeadline.Lasttime MrTrump stopped shortof re-instatingAmerican sanctions, which couldpromptIran to withdrawfrom the deal. Bymid-Januaryhe mustagain decide wheth-erto do so. European diplomatsworry thatthe protestswill give him a pretext. Thehead ofIran’snuclearagencysaid he mightthen stop co-operatingwith the IAEA. ButIran hasan interestin preservingthe dealand keepingthe othersignatoriesonboard. Unlike America, the EUhascom-pletelylifted economicsanctions. If Irankicksoutnuclearinspectors, those toocould be reimposed.European countriescould assuage MrTrump byworkingto counterIran’smed-dlingin Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. Con-gresswantsto use targeted sanctions topunish Iranian oﬃcialswho preside overhuman-rightsabuses. America could alsohone existingsanctions, which have unin-tended consequences. Manyprotesterscommunicated overTelegram, a popularmessagingapp, before the regime blockedit. Activistsin othercountriesmight haveswitched to Signal, a similarapp. It ishard-erto shutdown because itusesGoogle’scloud-computingplatform to disguise itstraﬃc. Thatplatform, however, islargelyblocked in Iran—byGoogle itself, whichfearsfallingfoul ofAmerican sanctions.Such a change could help duringthenextround ofprotests, which isall but in-evitable. Iranianshad high expectationsforMrRouhani. Theyremain unmet.ThoughGDPisgrowing, unemploymentisstubbornlyhigh. Corruption iswide-spread. Watershortages, poorairqualityand the bungled response to a deadlyearthquake lastNovemberhave damagedthe regime’sreputation.

Anewfee on expatriate workersshould bringin a similarsum. Fuel priceshave been raised: the costofthe lowest-grade petrol isup by83%. To cushion theblow, civil servantswill receive an extra1,000 riyals($267) permonth. Retireesandstudentswill also getlargerpayments.Oil revenuesare expected to increaseby12% in 2018, to $131bn. Higherprices,though, will help lessthan before. Lastyearthe governmentcutthe taxrate onAramco, the state-run oil giant, from 85% to50%. The move makesthe ﬁrm more attrac-tive to investorsahead ofa planned IPO. Italso takesbillionsin annual revenue oﬀthe table. In the longterm, Prince Muham-mad wantsto diversifythe Saudi economyawayfrom petroleum and the publicsec-tor. The budgetassumesnon-oil growth of3.7% thisyear, more than double the rate in2017.

Although thiswasonlyhalfthe numberthatapplied in Ger-many, itmarked a jump of17% on the previ-ousyear. Manymigrantsused to shunFrance, preferringGermanyorSweden;theyoften passed through France only toreach Britain. Atone pointin 2015, whenGermanyopened itsdoorsto an inﬂux ofSyriansand Iraqis, the French authoritiesrented coachesand drove to Munich to tryto temptsome to France. Butthe coachescame backhalf-empty. Nowthe mood hasshifted. Asurge ofapplicants, led by Alba-nians, Afghans, Haitiansand Sudanese, isputtingfresh pressure on the processingsystem—and on the unityofPresidentEm-manuel Macron’sgoverningparty. Duringhiscampaign, to liberals’ de-light, MrMacron declared thatMrsMerkelhad “rescued Europe’scollective dignity”byopeningthe doors. Fightingoﬀthe ultra-nationalistMarine Le Pen, the candidaterepeatedlymade the case foropen bordersand a humane response to asylum-seek-ing. Yetin oﬃce he seemsto have hardenedhisline. Anewimmigration and asylumbill, designed to tighten the rules, isdue tobe unveiled nextmonth. Asitscontoursemerge, MrMacron’sgovernmentﬁndsit-selfcharged with betrayingthose princi-ples, notleastbysome ofitsown deputies.Edouard Philippe, France’scentre-rightprime minister, saysthatthe bill will helpto accelerate asylum procedures, improveconditionsin receptioncentresand“strengthen the eﬃciency” ofruleson ille-gals. Itscritics, however, condemn it asau-thoritarian and illiberal. One measure un-derconsideration, forinstance, wouldreduce from a month to 15 daysthe dead-line forlodgingan appeal againsta refusalofasylum. Anotherwould increase themaximum period ofdetention forillegalimmigrantsfrom 45 daysto 90. In Decem-berrefugee charitieswere outraged whenthe governmentordered a censusofmi-grantsin emergencyreception centres.“Notall foreignersin France are terrorists;notall foreignersin France are beneﬁt-scroungers,” declared an angrySoniaKrimi, a deputyfrom MrMacron’sownparty, La République en Marche (LRM), inparliament.To head oﬀa rebellion within the gov-erningparty, which remainsa loose cen-tristmovementofmostlyﬁrst-time depu-ties, the governmenthasbegun a series ofmeetingswith them to explain the broadercontext. Lastyearmore asylum-seekers inFrance applied from Albania, a countryconsidered safe, than anywhere else. Bare-ly6% ofthem were granted asylum, com-pared with an average of36% acrossall na-tionalities. Ofthe 3,249 Syrianswhoapplied in 2017, bycontrast, 95% were ac-cepted asgenuine refugees. Ifasylum-seek-ersare to be treated humanelyand eﬃ-ciently, saysthe government, itneeds to siftoutthe bogusonesand enforce the rules.In a new-yearmessage, MrMacron spokeofFrance’s“moral and political duty” toactasa land ofrefuge forthose ﬂeeing per-secution. But, he added, “we cannotwel-come everybody.”Fresh from a trip to China, MrMacronwasthisweekheadingto Italyto discussMediterranean migrantﬂows, and then tothe northern portofCalaisto lookat cross-channel movements.

Furtherprogress, though, willbe harder; EU environmental standardsand workerprotections, forexample, willbe painful to meet. Some also worrythatthe rulingGeor-gian Dream isstiﬂingopposition. After theelection in 2012, Georgia waspraised for itsﬁrstpeaceful political transition since inde-pendence. Butdozensofoﬃcialsfrom thepreviousgovernmentwere then arrested,often beingcharged with abusesofpower.Theyinclude a formerprime minister,Vano Merabishvili, who isstill in prison.“Georgian Dream hasconsolidated power,butwe don’tsee manychecksand bal-ances,” saysVano Chkhikvadze fromOpen SocietyGeorgia Foundation, a hu-man-rightsgroup.

With herchildren living elsewhereand fewfriendsleft, she would notknowwhere to turn if she hadan accident. Thatmakesfor“a scarysortofloneliness”, she says. The UN projectsthatBulgaria’spopulation will fall from 7.2mto 5.2m by2050, makingitthe world’sfastest-shrinkingcountry(the nextnine are also in eastern Europe). Thisdemographic ca-tastrophe, concentrated in the countryside, ﬁndsitscruellest ex-pression in Bulgaria’sneglected north-west, the poorestregion ofthe poorestcountryin the European Union. Everyyearthe near-bycityofVratsa, a formerindustrial hub fallen on hard times,shrinksbyaround 2,000 people. Employerssaytheycannotﬁndskilled workers; localssaythere isno work. People here arepoorer, unhappierand likelierto leave than elsewhere in Bulgar-ia. Kalin Kamenov, Vratsa’smayor, saysthatwithoutinvestmentand state supporthistown will be virtuallyextinctin ten years. Bulgaria presentsperhapsthe mostextreme case ofthe de-population thatisravagingmuch ofeastern Europe. The post-communisttransition wasparticularlytraumatic(and delayed)here; in the 1990sthe fertilityrate plummeted and hundreds ofthousandsofyoungpeople ﬂocked to the richer, stabler countriesofwestern Europe, leavingthe olderand less-skilled behind. To-dayover1m Bulgarianslive abroad, around 700,000 ofthem inthe EU. Western European countrieslike Germanyhave olderpopulations, buttheirwealth leavesthem betterplaced to weath-erthe ﬁscal implicationsofa decliningworkforce, and theyareimportingimmigrants. In rapidlyageingBulgaria, already Eu-rope’sﬁfth-greyestcountry, nearly60% ofpensionersare belowthe government’spovertyline of321lev($196) a month. “We havearich-countryproblem, butwe’re nota rich country,” saysGeorgiAngelov, an economistatthe Open SocietyInstitute in Soﬁa. Governmentshave produced endlessstrategiesto arrest thedemographicdecline. None hashelped much.

Policiesare beingprepared to attract morepeople forlonger. In eightmonths, MrSimeonovboasts, the gov-ernmenthasdone more to improve the demographicoutlookthan all itspredecessors.Yetthere isa catch. MrSimeonov, who leadsthe far-right Na-tional Frontforthe Salvation ofBulgaria, sayshishunt fortalentdoesnotextend to refugees, whom he dismissesas“adventur-ists” seekingto suckEurope’swelfare statesdry. Thanksin part toaborderfence manned byguardswith a reputation forbrutality,the refugeeswho poured outofTurkeyin 2015-16 largelybypassedBulgaria forGreece. Thathasnotstopped Bulgaria’spoliticiansfrom whippingup anti-refugee hysteria. Rumen Radev, the So-cialistpresident, vowsto stop Bulgaria becoming“Europe’smi-grantghetto”. In 2016 Vratsa’scouncil banned refugee centres,though none existed orhad even been proposed. Some ﬁnd ironyin the hostilityofdepopulatingeastern Euro-pean countriesto receivingrefugees(an issue thatnow fallstoBulgaria to resolve, asittakesoverthe six-month rotating presi-dencyofthe EU’sministerial meetings). Otherssee a clear politi-cal logic. ForBulgarianson the sharp edge ofdepopulation,writesIvan Krastev, a political scientist, “the arrival ofmigrantssignalstheirexitfrom history”. Far-rightpartiesare notparticular-lystrongin Bulgaria, butperform bestin areasofdecline. AndBulgaria isnotinterested in addingto itsintegration troubles, saysMrSimeonov, when ithasenough diﬃcultieswith itsown “gyp-syrefugees” (the language isdecorous; in 2014 MrSimeonovdis-missed Bulgaria’sRoma as“arrogant, ferociousanthropoids”).Hope I die before I getoldThe refugee question isto some degree a red herring; few wouldwish to stayin a hostile, low-wage countryto which they have nolinkswhen richeronesare so close. Attractingworkers from clos-erto homeseemsa betterbet. So doesenticingémigrésback. Inrecentyearsemigration hasslowed and more Bulgariansare re-turning, although because ofitslowbirth rate—in part the conse-quence ofthe earlierexodusofyoungsters—the countryis stilllosingthe equivalentofVratsa’spopulation of50,000 everyyear. Optimistslookto well-run Estonia which, havinglost 17% ofitspopulation since itsliberation from Sovietrule, haslately en-joyed a small netinﬂow. Poland, which hastaken in hundreds ofthousandsofUkrainiansto service itsboomingeconomy, isan al-ternative model, butalso a rival. Bulgaria isdoingwell—the em-ploymentrate ishigherthan ever, and the publicﬁnances aresound—butso are itsricherneighbours. Corruption (Bulgaria israted the worstcountryin the EU byTransparencyInternational),red tape, bad schoolsand a lingeringstench ofgangsterism stillmaritin the eyesofforeign investors. And even ifthose returningcan help revitalise Bulgaria’seconomy, astheyhave in formercountriesofemigration like Ireland, theyare unlikely to reversethe demographicdamage. Bulgaria’sprospectsdo looka bitbrighterthan theyhave fora while, and itsnotoriously morosepeople have noticed: lastmonth a poll found a majority express-ingoptimism forthe ﬁrsttime in two decades. Butin future therewill be farfewerBulgariansto share thisgood cheer. 7IncrediblyshrinkingBulgariaDepopulating countries in Eastern Europe do notwantimmigrantsCharlemagne48The EconomistJanuary13th2018For daily analysis and debate on Britain, visitEconomist.com/britain1MORE sickdaysare taken in Januarythan in anyothermonth, asemploy-eesshun the chillyweatherfora day underthe duvet.

The deal should comprisethree parts: ﬁxingthe termsfora post-Brexittransitional arrangement; giving le-gal eﬀectto the Article 50 withdrawal dealthatwasprovisionallystrucklastmonth;and drawingup an agreed frameworkforthe future trade relationship.Both sideshave contingencyplans forno deal atall, butthe expectation after lastmonth’sdraftagreementisthatone willnowbe done.

The trickiestquestion ofall maybe whetherthere can be explicitprovision to extend transition beyond theend of2020, the EU’spreferred cut-oﬀdate,butthatcould yetbe fudged.Givinglegal eﬀectto the Article 50 with-drawal agreementwill throwup more pro-blems, notleastwhetherpaymentofBrit-ain’sexitbill can be made contingent onthe future trade deal. The thorniestissuemayarise from puttinginto treatytermsthe agreementto avoid a hard borderin Ire-land. Britain thinksthiscommitmentcanbe made consistentboth with leavingtheEUsingle marketand customsunion andwith divergingfrom EU regulations. Yetfewin Brussels(orDublin) agree.Indeed, regulatorydivergence and howto manage itwill be central to future tradenegotiations. The EUistakinga tough line:ifBritain leavesthe single marketand cus-tomsunion and wantsregulatorydi-vergence, itcan onlyhave a deal that ismainlyrestricted to trade in goods. MichelBarnier, the EU’schiefBrexitnegotiator,likesto argue thatMrsMay’sown “redlines”, on endingfree movementofpeopleand escapingthe jurisdiction ofthe Euro-pean CourtofJustice, pointto a free-tradeagreementlittle more comprehensive thanthose with South Korea orCanada. Therecan be no bespoke deal and no cherry-picking, the EU insists; and Britain mustalso maintain a level playing-ﬁeld on regu-lation, competition and state aid.Britain’sresponse isbroadlyto acceptthe trade-oﬀthatexistsbetween regula-torydivergence and accessto the singlemarket, butalso to note thatthe country isunique in startingin full compliance withEUlaw. Thatshould leave room fora biggerdeal, accompanied byan agreed mecha-nism forsettlingdisputesoveranyregula-torydivergence. All the EU’strade dealsarebespoke to some degree, even those forcountrieslike Norwaythatare members ofthe European EconomicArea (and thusalso ofthe single market). And when MrBarnierinsiststhathe cannotadd ﬁnancialservicesto the mix, the British governmentnotesthatexactlythiswasproposed in theEU’sabortive free-trade talkswith Americahalfa decade ago.The nextstep will come atthe end ofMarch, when EUleaderswill issue negoti-atingguidelineson trade to MrBarnier andhisteam. Before Christmasthere wassometalkofMrsMaydeliveringa bigspeechaboutexactlywhatBritain wanted ontrade, butthisisnowbeingplayed down.Alreadyin herFlorence speech lastSep-tembershe made clearthatshe waslook-ingfora deal on a farmore ambitious scalethan Canada’s, includingone thatcoveredservicesaswell asgoods.One hope in London isthat, when thehard bargainingbegins, the other27 EUcountriesmaynotbe asunited astheywere in the Article 50 talkslastyear. Ger-manyand France are backinga tough lineto protectthe integrityofthe single market,butseveral othercountriesbesidesIrelandare keen on a deep free-trade deal with Brit-ain. In return, some ofMrsMay’sred linesmaybe blurred a little. Butin the end shecannotavoid the choice between insistingon extensive regulatorydivergence orcleavingclose to EUrules.

In 2015, 47% ofunmarried 20- to 24-year-old Japanesemen said theyhad neverhad sexwith awoman, up from 34% in 2002.In short, youngpeople are lesshedonis-ticand breakfewerrulesthan in the past.Theyare “kind ofboring”, saysShoko Yo-neyama, an experton Japanese teenagersatthe UniversityofAdelaide. Whatis go-ingon?Theytuckyou upOne possible explanation isthatfamily lifehaschanged. Astudyof11countriesbyGiu-lia Dotti Sani and Judith Treas, two aca-demics, found thatparentsspend muchmore time on child care. In America, theaverage parentspent88 minutesa daypri-marilylookingafterchildren in 2012—upfrom 41minutesin 1965. Fathershaveupped theirchild-care hoursmostin pro-portional terms, though theystill do muchlessthan mothers. Because familiesaresmaller, the hoursare spread acrossfeweroﬀspring.Those doted-upon children seem tohave turned into amenable teenagers.

In 1991, 54% ofAmerican teenagersin gradesnine to 12(ages14-18) reported thattheywere sexual-lyexperienced, and 19% claimed to havehad sexwith atleastfourpartners.

Instead ofenthusingoverthe newgadgetspresented atthe event(see box),manyattendingdiscussed onlyone ques-tion: howgreatwould the damage be?Once the weaknessesbecame publicearlierthismonth (researchershad ﬁrst dis-covered them in June), some cyber-securi-tyexpertssaid the onlyfull protectionwould be to replace all aﬀected processors.The problem isbaked into the chipsandenablestwo separate, butsimilar, attacks.The ﬁrst, called Meltdown, makesitpossi-ble to dissolve the virtual wallsseparatingthe digital memoryused bydiﬀerentpro-grams, lettinghackersextractdata. The sec-ond, Spectre, enablesa rogue program totricka legitimate one runningon the samecomputerto divulge information.The scale ofthe threatcan be over-played. Computerﬁrmshave been toilingformonthson software “workarounds” toﬁxthe weaknessesand these are being de-ployed.

Some predictthatMeltdown willsoon be forgotten, butthatSpectre willplague computersforyearsbecause it of-fersmanyavenuesofattack.Even ifhackersneverpounce, however,the factthatthe ﬂawshave to be addressedmeanstheywill have an economicimpact.Almostanycomputercan theoretically beattacked, butprovidersofcloud-comput-ingservices, such asAmazon Web Servicesand Google, are mostvulnerable.

Yeteven ifthe ﬁrm doesnottake a ﬁnancialhit, the episode will have made itschief ex-ecutive, Brian Krzanich, lookbad.

Theyare dividedbetween hawks, who argue thatAmericaneedsto be tougherin itsdefence againstwhattheysee aseconomicwarfare wagedbyChina, and doves, who worryaboutthecostsofconﬂict. So far, againstall expecta-tionswhen PresidentDonald Trump en-tered the White House, the doveshave pre-vailed. The ﬁrstofa seriesoflegaldeadlinescould soon unleash the hawks.LastApril WilburRoss, the commercesecretary, initiated a probe into whethersteel importswere a threatto America’sna-tional security.

Thearmed forcesuse onlya tinyfraction ofdo-mesticsteel output, butsome producersclaim thatto make the requisite high-endspecialised steel, theyrelyon selling lower-qualitystuﬀin volume to covertheir ﬁxedcosts. The governmentcan also considersupportthatbluntsprice signals. This time,China isthe main culprit. Itsproductionbulged from 15% ofthe global total byvol-ume in 2000 to 50% in 2016. When itsdo-mesticdemand declined, exportsratherthan plantclosurestookthe strain, andmillselsewhere were leftidle. ExcludingChina, global capacityuse fell from 86% in2004 to 69% in 2016 (see left-hand chart). Even so, itishard to blame China forallthe world’ssteel woes. AdocumentseenbyThe Economist, produced in AugustbyMrTrump’sCouncil ofEconomicAdvisers,suggested thatthe surge ofsteel imports inthe ﬁrsthalfof2017 wasconsistentwithchangingdomesticdemand, notdumpingbyforeigners(nordid itseem, assome sug-gested later, to have been fed byimportersstockpilingsteel in anticipation oftariﬀs).The steel market’sstrugglesmaybeabating.

There isfur-therto go. Global capacity-utilisation ratesneed to be ﬁve to ten percentage points the importance ofsteel to America’s“criti-cal infrastructure”, includingchemical pro-duction, communicationsand dams.In fact, a heftychunkofAmerica’ssteelimportscome from long-standingallies,like Canada and the EU, ratherthan China,the hawks’ real target.

Hereceived a standingovation. MrSuther-land, who died on January7th, had anindispensable role in draggingthe “Uru-guayround” oftrade talksto agreement.He did notknowthatthiswasto be thelastsuch comprehensive, multilateraltrade deal ofhislifetime.Asdirector-general ofthe GeneralAgreementon Tariﬀsand Trade and, onitsfounding, ofthe World Trade Organi-sation, the Irishman wasthe public faceofbodieshelpingto integrate the globaleconomy. The sobriquet“fatherofglobal-isation” was, atthe time, a compliment.He remained proud ofthe WTO. In 2004he wrote that“forthe ﬁrsttime in history,the world can embrace a rules-basedsystem foreconomiccoexistence.”MrSutherland, a lawyerbytraining,came to Geneva bywayofthe Irish at-torney-general’soﬃce and the EuropeanUnion. Brieﬂyin charge ofthe EU’sedu-cation policy, he founded the Erasmusstudent-exchange programme to pro-mote European integration. Ascompeti-tion commissionerfrom 1985 to 1989, hisactivism drewMargaretThatcher’sire: hewas“thatawful man in Brussels”. Afterleavingthe WTOin 1995, hiscareerembodied the globalisation hehad championed. He chaired both lead-ingmultinationals(BP, Goldman SachsInternational), and worthyintellectualenterprises(the Trilateral Commission,the London School ofEconomics). Hiscareerwasenough to make enemiesamongthose who sawglobalisation asan elite conspiracy. He wasseen as hav-ingboth fostered the processand made alucrative careeroutofit. Buthe did moreto stoke the anti-globalists’ wrath, be-coming, asa UNspecial representative,one ofthe mostprominentadvocates ofthe beneﬁtsofthe free movementofpeople. He outraged nationalistsin 2012with remarkssuggestingthatundermin-ing“homogenisation”—ie, smudgingnational identities—wasnotso much anunfortunate side-eﬀectofmigration, asthe pointofit.So on hispassing, Breitbart, the digitalvoice ofthe alt-right, excoriated him asa“notoriousmass-migration and multicul-turalism campaigner”. Buthe ismuchmourned bythose, like thisnewspaper,sharinghishopesfor“noble experimentsin multilateralism”, and worryinglikehim thattheyhave “notalwaysbeensustained ordeveloped astheirfoundingfathersintended”.The death ofa formerhead ofthe GATTand the WTOITSTARTED asa joke.

Butcompanyanalysts, once amongthe mostpresti-giousprofessionalsin the stockmarket,are beingculled. NewEuropean rules,with the catchyname ofMiFID2, havejustdealtanalystsanotherblow. A studybyGreenwich Associatesestimatesthatthe budgetforthe research theyperformmaydrop by20% thisyear.In theirheydayin the late 1980sandearly1990s, analystscould make orbreakcorporate reputations. A“buy” or“sell”recommendation from the leadingtwo orthree analystsin an industrycould moveashare price substantially. Fund manag-ers, and manyﬁnancial journalists, reliedon analyststo spotthose companies thatwere on a risingtrajectory, and thosewhere the accountsrevealed signsof im-minenttrouble. And the bestanalystswere verywell paid.Butthatgolden age wasbuilton somerustyfoundations. Analystswere wellpaid because theyworked forthe big in-vestmentbanks. Butthose bigbanksmade moneynotjustbyhelpinginvestorsto trade butalso byadvisingcompanieson newissues, and on mergersand acqui-sitions. In such circumstances, there wasan implicitbargain thatanalystswouldbe positive abouta company’sprospects.Iftheywere not, the chiefexecutive mighttake hisbusinesselsewhere. Overtime,“buy” recommendationsfarexceeded“sell” suggestions. Thislooked lesslikedispassionate analysisthan marketing.Asecond problem came in the 2000sasregulatorscracked down on the waythatcompaniesreleased newsto the mar-ket. Information could no longerbe selec-tivelyreleased to favoured analysts. Bythe same token, those “Sherlock-like” an-alystswho liked to spottrendsthrough in-dependentcompanyvisitsfaced diﬃcul-ties. Everythingcame to depend on theproﬁtsguidance issued bycompaniesforthe nextquarteroryear. And analystsdared notlettheirforecastsstraytoo farfrom whatthe companiessuggested. Theparadoxical resultwasthatﬁnance, an in-dustrywhose acolytesoften trumpetthesuperiorityoffree-marketeconomics, hadcreated a poorlyfunctioningmarket—onethatwasoversupplied with analystswhomostlyoﬀered the same product.Why, then, did itsurvive atall? The con-ventional waythatinvestorsrewardedbanksforgood research wasnotto pay foritdirectly, butto funnel securities tradestheirway. Thissystem of“soft” commis-sionscreated two conﬂict-of-interest ques-tions. Were fund managerstradingmorethan theyneeded to justto payfortheir re-search? And were theygettingthe besttermsavailable when theydid thattrade?In both cases, the client, notthe fund man-ager, wasin eﬀectpayingforthe service.There waslittle incentive to change. Underthe newMiFIDrules, bankswillnotbe allowed to bundle research up withotherproducts. Fund managerswill haveto payforitseparately. Asa result, theyareexpected to be much more selective. ThisrecallsDrJohnson’sresponse when Bos-well asked whetherthe Giant’sCause-wayin Northern Ireland wasworth see-ing. The greatman replied: “Worth seeing,yes; butnotworth goingto see.” The sus-picion isthat, formanyfund managers,the workofanalystsis“worth having, butnotworth payingto have”. The rulesmaytechnicallyapplyonlyto Europe buteven American investmentbanksare expected to adjusttheirbusi-nessmodelsto cope with MiFID. The em-ploymentprospectsofanalystshad al-readybeen hitbyindex-tracking, or“passive” fund management, which sim-plybuysall the sharesin a benchmark,and bythe growth ofquantitative hedgefunds, which use computerprogramstoselectstocks. Butthe bestanalystsneed notdespaircompletely. The biggestfund managersemployin-house research. Some maybewillingto payforanalysisfrom indepen-dentboutiques(ashasbeen the case inthe world ofeconomics). The fear, however, isthatsomethingwill be lostin the process. Forall theirfaults, analystsacted asconduitsfor com-panyinformation to be passed to inves-torswho could notaﬀord theirown re-search (charitiesand small pensionfunds, forexample) and, via the media, tothe general public. Afewheroicanalysts(one thinksofRichard Hannah, a long-term Eurotunnel sceptic) proved adept atexposingcorporate ﬂimﬂam. Alas, the industrygenerated fartoofewscepticsand fartoo manycorporatecheerleaders.

He wasfarfrom aloneatthe time. Ascash rushed outofthe coun-try, analystsdebated whetherthe yuanwould collapse, and some hedge fundsbetthatdaywascomingfast. Buttwo years on,the horse isbackin the barn: the govern-ment’sdefence ofthe yuan hassucceeded,in partthrough tightercapital controls.The latestevidence wasan 11th consec-utive monthlyincrease in foreign-ex-change reservesin December. Duringthattime China’sstockpile ofoﬃcial reserves,the world’sbiggest, climbed by$142bn,reaching$3.14trn, roughlydouble the cush-ion usuallyregarded asneeded to ensure ﬁ-nancial stability. Anothersign ofChina’ssuccessisthe yuan itself.

Housingpricessoared and industrial ﬁrms’ proﬁtsrose by20% lastyearon the backofhighercommodityprices. Here, MrBernanke canclaim some vindication: in lookingat Chi-na’soptionsin 2016, he had suggested thataﬁscal boostwould supportgrowth andso help keep cash athome. An unconven-tional policymix—investmentin low-in-come housingand closure ofexcessindus-trial capacity—did the trick.China had a stroke ofgood luck, too.Manyhad thoughtthatDonald Trump’spresidencywould initiallyadd to dollarstrength, which mighthave pulled cashawayfrom China. ButAmerica’spoliticalmuddle instead weighed on the dollar. Notonlydid thatboostthe relative allure ofChinese assets, italso made itsforeign-ex-change reserveslookmore valuable in dol-larterms, because roughlya third are heldin othercurrencies. Overthe pastyear, trueinﬂowsaccounted forjustabouta third ofthe rise in China’sreserves; valuationchangesexplained the rest(see chart onpreviouspage). OtherAsian economieswith heftyforeign-currencyreserves, fromJapan to Taiwan, reaped similargains.AsAmerica cutstaxesand raisesinter-estrates, the dollarmaysoon perkup.

Thatthe destruction wasgreatenough forinsur-ance lossesto reach record levelshas onlyjustbeen conﬁrmed. Accordingto ﬁguresreleased on January4th byMunich Re, a re-insurer, global, inﬂation-adjusted insuredcatastrophe lossesreached an all-time highof$135bn in 2017 (see chart). Total losses (in-cludinguninsured ones) reached $330bn,second onlyto lossesof$354bn in 2011.Alarge portion ofthe lossesin 2011wascaused byone catastrophe: the earthquakeand tsunami in Japan. Lossesin 2017 werelargelytraceable to extreme weather. Fully97% were weather-related, well above theaverage since 1980 of85%. Ifclimate changebringsmore frequentextreme weather, asMunich Re and othersexpect, lastyear’slosslevelsmaybecome depressinglyfa-miliar. Already, the data showmanymorefrequenthigh-losseventssince 2000—lotsofthem weather-related—than in the twoprecedingdecades.Lastyear’sdisasterswere particularlyconcentrated in North America (includingthe Caribbean), with 83% ofglobal losses;halfofthose were in America alone, hit-tingthatcountry’sinsurersparticularlyhard.

Insurershave longspreadcatastrophe riskbytakingoutreinsurancepolicies. Thistime, reinsurershad such am-ple capital buﬀersthattheyare expected tosuﬀeronlya small dent, ofaround 5-7% ofcapital. And 2017 wasalso the biggesttestso farofreinsurance provided directly byinvestors, whetherthrough catastrophebondsor“collateralised reinsurance”,where a fund managerputsup collateral tocoverpotential claims. These formsof “al-ternative capital”, which reached $89bn inmid-2017, nowmake up around 14% oftotalreinsurance capital, up from 4% in 2006, ac-cordingto Aon, a broker.Theirperformance hasbeen remark-ablysmooth.

Itssalience hasgrown astechieshave become convinced thatmachinelearningand artiﬁcial intelligence willsoon puthordesofworkersoutofwork(amongtech-moguls, Bill Gateshascalledfora robottaxto deterautomation, andElon Muskfora universal basicincome). Alotofeconomiststhinkthata surge in pro-ductivitythatwould leave millionson thescrapheap isunlikelysoon, ifatall. Yetthisyear’smeetingofthe American EconomicAssociation, which wound up in Philadel-phia on January7th, showed theyare tak-ingthe tech believersseriously. Asessionon weakproductivitygrowth wasbusy;the manycoveringthe implicationsofautomation were packed out.Recenthistoryseemsto supportpro-ductivitypessimism. From 1995 to 2004outputperhourworked grewatan annualaverage pace of2.5%; from 2004 to 2016 thepace wasjust1%. Elsewhere in the G7 groupofrich countries, the pace hasbeen slowerstill. An obviousexplanation isthat the ﬁ-nancial crisisof2007-08 led ﬁrmsto deferproductivity-boostinginvestment. Not so,sayJohn Fernald, ofthe Federal ReserveBankofSan Francisco, and co-authors,who estimate thatin America, the slow-down began in 2006. Itscause wasdeceler-ating“total factorproductivity”—the resid-ual thatdeterminesGDPafterlabourandcapital have been accounted for. Productiv-ityhasstagnated despite swellingresearchspending(see chart). Thissupportsthepopularidea thatfewertransformativetechnologiesare leftto be discovered. Otherstake almostthe diametricallyopposed view. Apresentation byErikBrynjolfsson ofMITpointed to recentsharp gainsin machines’ abilityto recog-nise patterns. Theycan, forinstance, out-perform humansatrecognisingmostim-ages—crucial to the technologybehinddriverlesscars—and match dermatologists’accuracyin diagnosingskin cancer. MrBrynjolfsson and hisco-authorsforecastthatsuch advanceswill eventuallylead toawidespread reorganisation ofjobs, aﬀect-inghigh- and low-skilled workersalike.Productivitypessimism remainsthenorm amongoﬃcial forecasters, butmoreacademicsare tryingto understand howautomation mayaﬀectthe economy. In aseriesofpapers, Daron AcemogluofMITand Pascual Restrepo ofBoston Universitypresentnewtheoretical modelsofinnova-tion. Theypropose thattechnological pro-gressbe divided into two categories: thesortthatreplaceslabourwith machines;and thatwhich createsnew, more complextasksforhumans. The ﬁrst, automation,pushesdown wagesand employment.The second, the creation ofnewtasks, canrestore workers’ fortunes. Historically, theauthorsargue, the two typesofinnovationseem to have been in balance, encouragedbymarketforces. Ifautomation leads to alabourglut, wagesfall, reducingthe returnsto furtherautomation, so ﬁrmsﬁnd new,more productive waysto putpeople toworkinstead. Asa result, previouspredic-tionsoftechnology-induced joblessnesshave proved mostlywrong.However, the two forcescan, in theory,fall outofsync. Forexample, ifcapital ischeap relative to wages, the incentive toautomate could prevail permanently, lead-ingthe economyto robotise completely.The authorsspeculate that, fornow, biasestowardscapital in the taxcode, orsimplyan “almostsingularfocus” on artiﬁcial in-telligence, mightbe tiltingﬁrmstowardsautomation, and awayfrom thinkingupnewtasksforpeople. Anotherriskis thatmuch ofthe workforce lacksthe right skillsto complete the new-economytasksthatinnovatorsmightdream up.These ideasshed lighton the productiv-ityparadox. MrBrynjolfsson and hisco-authorsargue thatitcan take yearsfor thetransformative eﬀectsofgeneral-purposetechnologiessuch asartiﬁcial intelligenceto be fullyfelt. Ifﬁrmsare consumed byef-fortsto automate, and such investmentstake time to payoﬀ, itmakessense that pro-ductivitygrowth would stall. Investmenthasnotbeen unusuallylowrelative to GDPin recentyears, butithasshifted away fromstructuresand equipment, towardsre-search-and-developmentspending. Ifresearch in automation doesstartyieldingbigpay-oﬀs, the question is whatwill happen to the displaced workers. Re-centtrendssuggestthe economycan createunskilled jobsin sectorssuch ashealthcare orfood serviceswhere automation isrelativelydiﬃcult. And ifrobotsand algo-rithmsbecome farcheaperthan workers,theirownersshould become rich enoughto consume much more ofeverything, cre-atingmore jobsforpeople.The riskisthatwithoutsuﬃcient invest-mentin training, technologywill relegatemanymore workersto the ranksofthelow-skilled. To employthem all, payorworkingconditionsmighthave to deterio-rate. Ifproductivityoptimistsare right, theeventual problem maynotbe the quantityofavailable work, butitsquality. 7Automation and productivityProducingideasPHILADELPHIA AND WASHINGTON, DCEconomists grapple with the future ofthe labourmarketLess bang for a buckSource: Federal Reserve Bank of St LouisUnited States199520000510151702462+–1995200005101517Real output per person per hour% change on a year earlierResearch-and-development spendingAs % of GDP1.41.61.866FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistJanuary13th2018YOUhave multiple jobs, whetheryouknowitornot.

Ifthe economyisto function prop-erlyin the future—and ifa crisisoftechnological unemploymentisto be avoided—we musttake accountofthis, and change the re-lationship between biginternetcompaniesand theirusers.Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) isgettingbetterall the time, andstandspoised to transform a hostofindustries, saythe authors(Imanol Arrieta Ibarra and Diego JiménezHernández, ofStanfordUniversity, Leonard Goﬀ, ofColumbia University, and Jaron La-nierand Glen Weyl, ofMicrosoft). But, in orderto learn to drive acarorrecognise a face, the algorithmsthatmake clever machinestickmustusuallybe trained on massive amountsofdata.

Theyalsohooverup valuable data from usersthrough the use oftools likereCAPTCHA, which askvisitorsto solve problemsthatare easyforhumansbuthard forAIs, such asdecipheringtextfrom booksthatmachinesare unable to parse. Thatdoesnotjustscreen outmaliciousbots, butalso helpsdigitise books.

Would-be startupsthatmightchallenge internetgiantscannottrain their AIswith-outaccessto the data onlythose giantspossess. Their besthope isoften to be acquired bythose verysame titans, addingto the pro-blem ofuncompetitive markets. That, fornow, AI’scontributionsto productivitygrowth aresmall, the authorssay, ispartlybecause ofthe free-data model,which limitsthe qualityofdata gathered. Firmstrying to developuseful applicationsforAImusthope thatthe data theyhave aresuﬃcient, orcome up with waysto coaxusersinto providingthem with betterinformation atno cost. Forexample, they mustpesterrandom people—like those blur-decipheringvisitors towebsites—into labellingdata, and hope thatin theirannoyanceand haste theydo notmake mistakes. Even so, asAIimproves, the amountofworkmade vulnerableto displacementbytechnologygrows, and evermore ofthe valuegenerated in the economyaccruesto proﬁtable ﬁrmsrather thanworkers. Asthe authorspointout, the share ofGDPpaid outtoworkersin wagesand salaries—once thoughtto be relatively sta-ble—hasalreadybeen decliningoverthe pastfewdecades.To tackle these problems, theyhave a radical proposal. Ratherthan beingregarded ascapital, data should be treated as labour—and, more speciﬁcally, regarded asthe propertyofthose who gen-erate such information, unlesstheyagree to provide it to ﬁrmsinexchange forpayment. In such a world, userdata mightbe soldmultiple times, to multiple ﬁrms, reducingthe extentto whichdata setsserve asbarriersto entry. Paymentsto users fortheirdatawould help spread the wealth generated byAI. Firmscould alsopotentiallygenerate betterdata bypaying. Ratherthan guesswhata person isup to astheywanderaround a shopping centre,forexample, ﬁrmscould askindividualsto share information onwhich shopswere visited and which itemswere viewed, in ex-change forpayment. Perhapsmostambitiously, the authors musethatdata labourcould come to be seen asuseful work, conferringthe same sortofdignityaspaid employment: a desirable side--eﬀectin a possible future ofmassautomation.The authors’ ideasneed ﬂeshingout; theirpaper, thought-pro-vokingthough itis, runsto onlyﬁve pages.

One concernsthe imbal-ance ofpowerin the marketfordata. Thatstemspartly from con-centration amongbiginternetﬁrms. Butitisalso because, thoughdata maybe extremelyvaluable in aggregate, an individual’sper-sonal data typicallyare not. Forone Facebookuserto threaten todeprive Facebookofhisdata isno threatatall. So eﬀective negoti-ation with internetﬁrmsmightrequire collective action: and theformation, perhaps, ofa “data-labourunion”. Thismighthave drawbacks. Aunion mightdemand too muchin compensation fordata, forexample, impairingthe develop-mentofuseful AIs.

Since 1996, the photomultiplier-tube detectors(pictured above) atSuper-Kamiokande, an experimentunderwayakilometre beneath MountIkeno, nearHida, have been lookingforsignsthat oneofthe decillion (1033) orso protonsand neu-tronswithin it(ofwhich a watermoleculecontainsten and eightrespectively) has de-cayed into lightersubatomicparticles. Thatthose tubeshave, in the more than20 yearsthe experimenthasbeen running,failed to do so isa conundrum forphysics,and one thatisbecomingmore urgentwitheverypassingmonth. Grand uniﬁed theo-ries(GUTs), thoughtsince theirgenesis inthe 1970sto be the mostpromisingroute tounderstandingthe fundamental forcesthatbind mattertogether, predictthat pro-tonsand neutronsshould occasionally dis-integrate in a waythatbreakswhatwaspreviouslyregarded asan iron lawof phys-ics—namelythatthe numberofbaryons (aclassofparticle thatincludesboth protonsand neutrons) in the universe isconstant.The crucial word, though, is“occasion-ally”. Ifthe GUTapproach isright, the aver-age decaytime in question isfarlongerthan the age ofthe universe itself. But bysymmetryisone, butnotthe onlyone)have also suﬀered blowsin the pastfewyears. The existence ofthismysteriousstuﬀ, which isthoughtto make up almost85% ofthe matterin the universe, can be in-ferred from itsgravitational eﬀects on themotion ofgalaxies. Yetno experiment hasglimpsed anyofthe menagerie ofhypo-thetical particlesphysicistshave speculat-ed mightcompose it.Despite the dearth ofdata, the answersthatall these theoriesoﬀerto some ofthemostvexingquestionsin physicsare so el-egantthattheypopulate postgraduate text-books. AsPeterWoitofColumbia Univer-sityobserves, “Overtime, these ideasbecame institutionalised. People stoppedthinkingofthem asspeculative.” Thatisunderstandable, fortheyappearto havegreatexplanatorypower. GUTs, forexam-ple, seekto merge three ofthe fourknownfundamental forces: the strong, weakandelectromagneticinteractions(gravity isthefourth). In the process, theyexplain,amongotherthings, the overwhelmingpreponderance ofmatteroverantimatterin the universe, a puzzlingobservationcalled matter-antimatterasymmetry. The Standard Model, the currentbesttheoryin particle physics, cannotdo this.GUTs, on the otherhand, positvariousmechanismsbywhich subatomicparticles(ofboth matterand antimatter) can fallapartand thus, in some way, allowmatterto gain the upperhand. Unfortunately,mostofthese are untestable with currenttechnology. Recreatingthe incredibly highenergiesatwhich the fundamental forcesare thoughtto merge (those encounteredduringthe earlymomentsofthe BigBang)would require a particle colliderlargerthan the solarsystem. OfGUTs’ predic-corrallinghuge numbersofbaryonsto-gether, the people behind Super-Kamio-kande hoped to spotone decayingmuchsooner, in justa fewyears. Those hopeshave been dashed. The detector’smostre-centestimate, published in January2017,nowpegsthe lifetime ofa proton atmorethan 1.6 x1034years—and rising. ThatrulesoutsimplerGUTs(includingthe ﬁrst,called SU(5), proposed byHoward Georgiand Sheldon Glashowin 1974). Italso en-croacheson the predictionsofmore recent,and more complex, varietiessuch as“ﬂipped SU(5)”.In the darkGUTsare amongseveral long-establishedtheoriesthatremain stubbornlyunsup-ported bythe big, costlyexperiments test-ingthem. Supersymmetry, which positsthatall known fundamental particleshaveaheaviersupersymmetricpartner, called asparticle, isanothercreature ofthe seven-tiesthatremainsin limbo.

These otherdimen-sions, iftheyexist, remain hidden fromthose searchingforthem.Finally, theoriesthattouch on the com-position ofdarkmatter(ofwhich super-Particle physicsNo GUTs, no gloryFundamental physics is frustrating physicistsScience and technology68ScienceandtechnologyThe EconomistJanuary13th201812tions, onlythe proton and neutron decaybeingsoughtbySuper-Kamiokande seemstestable. And, so far, the testsare negative. Asimilarstorycan be told forsuper-symmetry. Thistheorycan, amongotherthings, accountforthe value ofthe mass ofthe Higgsboson (a recentlydiscovered par-ticle thatisresponsible forimbuing otherparticleswith mass) in a waythatthe Stan-dard Model cannot. Nothingin thatmodelgivesa precise value forthe Higgs’sownmass, and calculationsfrom ﬁrstprinci-ples, based on quantum theory, suggest itshould be enormous—roughlya hundredmillion billion timeshigherthan its mea-sured value. Physicistshave therefore in-troduced an uglyfudge factorinto theirequations(a processcalled “ﬁne-tuning”)to sidestep the problem. Supersymmetryresolvesitmore neatly. The problem arisesbecause asa Higgsboson movesthrough space, itencounters“virtual” versionsofStandard Model parti-cles(like photonsand electrons) that areconstantlypoppingin and outofexistence.Accordingto the Standard Model, these in-teractionsdrive the massofthe Higgs up toimprobable values. In supersymmetry,however, theyare cancelled outbyinterac-tionswith theirsparticle equivalents.Variousﬂavoursofsupersymmetrypredictthatone orotherofthe sparticlesshould have popped up bynowin theLarge Hadron Collider. The LHC(one ofthedetectorsofwhich ispictured above, un-derconstruction) isthe principal machineatCERN, the world’sbiggestparticle-phys-icslaboratory, nearGeneva.

Thisisthe riddle ofwhygravity isso much weakerthan the otherthree fun-damental interactions—asdemonstratedbythe factthata fridge magnetcan pick upapaperclip, and in so doingeasilyover-come the gravitational force ofa wholeplanet. The connection with the Higgs-massproblem isthatifthe Higgsreally washuge, thatwould also make otherparticles(protons, neutronsand so on) more mas-sive, thusgivingthem much strongergravi-tational ﬁelds. Whereassupersymmetryresolvesthe problem via sparticles, theo-rieswith extra dimensions(such asADD)do so byallowinggravity, butnotthe otherthree fundamental forces, to spreadthrough these dimensions. Thatdissipatesgravity’sstrength in comparison with thatofthe otherthree. Thishappensbecause gravitons(thehypothetical particlesthatcarrythe gravi-tational force) leakinto those dimensions.Ifgravitonswere created in the LHC, whichsome theoriessuggestispossible, thensignsofsuch leakage could be sought. Sofar, though, no LHC-generated gravitonshave turned up.The dark-matterpicture ismore com-plexstill. There are plentyoflines ofevi-dence indicatingthe stuﬀexists, and manytheoriesthatpropose thisorthatparticle toexplain whatitmightactuallybe. As itsname suggests, darkmatterisdiﬃcult tospot. Though itparticipatesin gravitationalinteractions, itdoesnotinteractelectro-magnetically. Thismeansitneitheremitsnorabsorbslight. Nordoesitgetinvolvedwith the strongforce—the one thatholdsatomicnuclei together. One classofhypo-thetical objectsthatmightbe darkmatterdo interactvia the weakforce, a phenome-non thatalso controlssome sortsofradio-active decay. These objectsare calledWIMPS(weaklyinteractingmassive parti-cles). Exactlywhattheyare remainsob-scure. Some sparticleswould ﬁtthe bill,butthere are othercandidates. Several pos-sible WIMPs, though, should be detectablebyexperimentsthat, like Super-Kamio-kande, involve large tanksofliquid. TankwarfareIn those experimentsthe preferred ﬂuid isnotwaterbutliquid xenon, and the phe-nomenon beingsoughtisnota spontane-ousdecaybutan interaction between aWIMPand an atomicnucleus, which willgenerate a ﬂash oflightthatcan be de-tected byarraysofphotomultipliertubesatthe top and bottom ofthe tank. Xenon isthe darlingofdark-matterhuntersbecauseitisa heavyelementwith a large nucleus. Itisthusmore likelyto gethitthan lighter at-oms. Itisalso reasonablycheap, unreactiveand easyto purify. So far, however, the xe-non-ﬁlled vatshave remained asdark asthe mattertheyhope to ﬁnd. Two oftheworld’sthree mostsensitive xenon-tankexperimentsreported theirlatestresults inOctober2017. SearchesbyXENON1T, underGran Sasso, a mountain in Italy, and Pan-daX-II atChina JinpingUnderground Lab-oratory, in Sichuan, which contain 3,500kgand 500kgofxenon respectively, came upempty-handed. The third ofthe trio, 368kgofxenon in an experimentcalled LUX, in aformergold mine in the BlackHillsofSouth Dakota, also failed to ﬁnd WIMPsbefore itwasshutdown in May2016.These WIMPsearcheshave becomeprogressivelylargeroverthe pasttwo de-cades. XENON1T, forinstance, waspreced-ed bytwo detectors, XENON10 (15kg) andXENON100 (165kg), the ﬁrstofwhich start-ed workin 2006. LUXwill be followed byLUX-ZEPLIN, which will use 7,000kgofthestuﬀ. In China, PandaX-4T(4,000kg) isal-readybeingbuiltand there are tentativeplansfora whopping30,000kgdetector(PandaX-30T). Even somethingofthatsize,though, would notaltogetherrule outWIMP-based hypotheseswere itto ﬁnd noevidence ofWIMPS.

Yetitisan uncomfortable factthatthe relentlesspursuitofeverbiggerand betterexperimentsin theirﬁeld isdri-ven asmuch bybeliefasbyevidence. The core ofthisbeliefisthatNature’srulesshould be mathematicallyelegant.So far, theyhave been, so itisnota beliefwithoutfoundation. Butthe convictionthatthe truth mustbe mathematically ele-gantcan easilylead to a false obverse: thatwhatismathematicallyelegantmustbetrue. Hence the unwillingnessto give upon GUTsand supersymmetry. Newtheo-rieshave been made byweavingtogetheraspectsofolderones. Flipped SU(5), forex-ample, combinesGUTwith supersymme-tryto explain the Higgsmass, the hierarchyproblem and matter-antimatterasymme-try—and providesdark-mattercandidatesto boot. With everyfudge applied, though,whatwere once eleganttheoriesgetless so.Some researchersare therefore becomingopen to the possibilitythatthe truth-is-beautyargumentisa trap, and thatthe uni-verse is, in fact, fundamentallymessy.The beautymythOne such isSabine HossenfelderoftheFrankfurtInstitute forAdvanced Studies,in Germany. She arguesthatthe appeal ofGUTs, supersymmetryand the like rests ontheirabilityto explain “numerological co-incidences” thatdo notneed to be ex-plained. Perhaps, to take one example, theuniverse simplystarted outwith morematterthan antimatterin it, ratherthanthisbeinga consequence ofitssubsequentevolution. Asshe pointsout, no theory pre-cludesthispossibility—itisjustthat itisnotveryelegant. Similarly, she says, “It’snotlike anybodyactuallyneedssupersymme-tryto explain anything. It’san idea widelypraised foritsaestheticappeal. Well, that’snice, butit’snotscience.”DrHossenfelder’sremainsa minorityopinion, butotherheterodoxapproaches,perhapsbecause theyoﬀerthe possibilityofexperimental testing, are also gainingground. SurjeetRajendran ofthe Universi-tyofCalifornia, Berkeley, forexample, isusinga “suckitand see” method thatwould have been familiarto 19th-centuryphysicists, who did notyethave a hugebodyoftheoryto guide and constrain theirexperiments. He issearchingfordark-mat-terparticlesoutside the range ofmassesthatconventional theoriesofwhatWIMPsare predict.Thathe and hiscolleaguesare able todo so is, in part, because theirapparatus issmall and cheap—and thusworth a puntbya grantcommittee. Atitscore lies a sensi-tive magnetometer, known asa SQUID.Thisshould pickup the tinymagneticﬁeldsthatdark-matterparticleswould beexpected to generate indirectlybyweak-force interactionswith atomicnuclei astheyﬂythrough the apparatus. AsDr Ra-jendran’sexperimentsare carefullyshield-ed, onlysuch particles, with theirextraor-dinarilyweakinteractionswith normalmatter, would be expected to enterthe ap-paratusand be detected.Otherteams, workingwithin the limitsofconventional-but-as-yet-unproven the-ory, have similarlyeconomical, collider-es-chewingideas. ADDand other, related,ideaspredictthatextra dimensionsarepopulated bynon-Standard Model parti-cles. Tinyobjects, held lessthan a tenth ofamillimetre apart, should experience forcestransmitted bythese particlesin ways de-tectable bybench-top apparatus. Suchforceswould, forinstance, cause the gravi-tational attraction between the objects inquestion to deviate from Newton’sin-verse-square law, which statesthatthegravitational force between two bodies isinverselyproportional to the square of thedistance between them.AndrewGeraci and histeam atthe Uni-versityofNevada, in Reno, hope to ﬁndsuch deviationsbytrackingthe movementofa glassbead just300 billionthsofa me-tre across, cradled in a networkoflaserlight. Similarly, EricAdelbergerofthe Uni-versityofWashington, in Seattle, is em-ployinga torsion balance, a piece of kitin-vented over200 yearsago forthe purposeofmeasuringweakforces(HenryCaven-dish, a British natural philosopherof the18th century, used one, illustrated below, toworkoutthe density, and therefore themass, ofEarth). Anumberofothergroupsare searchingforthe eﬀectsofthese forceswithin moleculesthatconsistofjust twoatoms. Anyextradimensional forcesexpe-rienced bythe atomswill translate into mi-nute diﬀerencesbetween the energylevelsoftheirelectrons. Such diﬀerencescan, inturn, be probed spectroscopicallybyusingalaserto excite the electronsand measur-ingthe wavelengthsatwhich theythenemitlight.Advancesin laserphysicsofthis sortare also behind ACME, an experimentoc-cupyingabout100 square metresoflab-oratoryspace atHarvard University.

The electronsbeinglooked at areinside moleculesofthorium monoxide,which hassome unique propertiesthatmake itsuited to the search.Accordingto the Standard Model, anelectron’scharge issphericallydistributed.Interactionswith sparticles, however,would deform thissphere in a waythatwould create a slightpositive charge in oneplace and an equal, negative charge oppo-site it. When placed in an electricﬁeld, thisdeformed electron would experience aforce called a torque thatwould cause ittorotate. The strongerthe ﬁeld, the more tor-que there would be. There isa particularelectron in a molecule ofthorium monox-ide thatisexposed, byitslocation betweenthe thorium and oxygen atoms, to an elec-tricﬁeld of100 gigavoltspercentimetre—amillion timesgreaterthan anythingthatcan be produced in a laboratory. Thatwould magnifythe torque on a distortedelectron to the pointwhere itshould be de-tectable with lasers. In 2014 the group behind ACMEpub-lished workshowingthatthe electronstheywere lookingathad propertiesin linewith those predicted bythe Standard Mod-el.

Thispugilisticencounterfeels notjustasifithappened in a verydiﬀerentcountryfrom the one subsequentlyre-named the DemocraticRepublicofCongo(DRC), butalmostin a diﬀerentage. The Zaire ofthe 1970shad alreadystart-ed a long, steadydescentunderMobutu’smisrule thatled to itseconomiccollapseand civil wartwo decadeslater. Butviewed from the dictator’s“Versaillesofthe jungle”, an ornate palace he built in hisancestral village, nothingseemed impossi-ble. Propped up byaid from America,which sawhim asa useful allyin the coldwar, Mobutu(pictured) ruled the countrylike a monarch, usingthe central bank’scash asifitwere hisown and indulging hiseverywhim. When he wanted to ﬂyto hisremote mansion in a supersonicConcordejet, he justordered a runwaylongenoughto accommodate one. When he decided tohostan international boxingﬁght, he sim-plystumped up $10m in prize moneyto at-tractone. When opponentsbecame trou-blesome, he killed them.The detail ofMobutu’sdepravityhasbeen amplydocumented in a stringofex-cellentbooks, so itmightbe thought thatthere could be little to add to them. ButPaulKenyon, an accomplished broadcastjour-nalistatthe BBC, hasmanaged to bringhismisrule vividlyto life in “Dictatorland”, abookaboutsome ofAfrica’smore notori-ousrulers, bylettingthe readerglimpsethem through the eyesofpeople who sawthem atﬁrsthand. John Matadi, a taxidriverin Kinshasa, recallshowimpishly heneedled Ali outside hishotel, pretendinghe supported MrForeman, whichprompted the boxerto sparplayfullywithhim in frontofa crowd gathered on thepavement. Furtheron, the readercomesacrossMrMatadi again, thistime talkingabouteventsa decade earlierwhen Mo-butuwasconsolidatinghisgrip on power.MrMatadi, incongruouslywearingslip-persand worryingthattheywere thewrongfootwear, getscaughtup in a crowdgatheringbefore a stage surrounded by sol-diers. Lookingto the side he seesan armytruckarriving. Évariste Kimba, a formerprime minister, isinside. MrMatadi thenwatchesasKimba, wristsbound, isforcedup a shortladderto the hastilyerected gallowsand hanged.Itisthese minute observationsthatmake MrKenyon’sbookso hard to putdown. Yet, atthe same time, theyare notsuﬃcientto overcome some ofthe majorfailingsof“Dictatorland”. Itsorigin, MrKenyon says, wasa call from hisagentwhen he wasundersiege in Crimea report-ingon the conﬂictthere, suggesting thatheshould write a book“aboutAfrica and themen who had stolen itsresources”. ButMrKenyon doeshisreadersno service in re-ducingAfrica’spost-colonial historyto itsmostburlesque brutes. Hischoice ofvil-lainsisalso odd. Mobutuﬁtsin rather well,asdoesRobertMugabe, Zimbabwe’slong-time president. ButFélixHouphouët-Boigny, the ﬁrstpresidentofIvoryCoast, isastrange inclusion when farmore brutaldictators, such asUganda’sIdi Amin orJean-Bedel Bokassa ofthe Central AfricanRepublic, are leftout. Mostunsatisfying,perhaps, isthatMrKenyon oﬀerslittle toexplain whyAfrica produced the thugs itdid—a criticism one would notlevel, for example, atMartin Meredith’sstill extraor-dinaryhistory, “The State ofAfrica”.7AfricaStickyﬁngersDictatorland: The Men Who Stole Africa.ByPaul Kenyon.

The ideathatscience and the artsare distinct, in-compatible culturesisan enduringone.Two newbooksseem to cutto the heart ofthe matter: human creativity.Edward Wilson, 88 and the authorof“The OriginsofCreativity”, isthe grand oldman ofHarvard biology. Hisspeciality ismyrmecology—the studyofants. Forashortbook, “The OriginsofCreativity” isbrimmingwith ideas, manyofwhich wan-der, asMrWilson’swritingoften does, be-yond the briefofthe title. Ultimately,though, everythingin the booktiesback togeneticsand evolution—and a beliefthatculture and creativityhave geneticroots.MrWilson tracesthe source ofcreativ-ityto human prehistory, on the African sa-vannah. Man’sancestorswere, fora time,dull, relativelyasocial vegetarians. Thecrucial step, MrWilson argues, came withthe switch to eatingmeat. Thismeant hav-ingto huntin groups, and thatmeant be-comingmore social: people had to co-oper-ate in the foray, and share the rewards. Thischange putan evolutionarypremium oncommunication and social intelligence.Eventually, bywayofnatural selection, itgave rise to symboliclanguage. And thusthe birth ofthe humanitiescame about, instorytellingand the “nocturnal ﬁrelight ofthe earliesthuman encampments”. Thisversion ofeventsisrelativelystraightforward. More controversial iswhere MrWilson triesto take the readernext.

The salvation ofthe humanities, heargues, liesin the “BigFive”: palaeontol-ogy, anthropology, psychology, evolution-arybiologyand neurobiology. Bystudyingthese diﬀerentareas, scientistswill be ableto connectaestheticsand cultural evolu-tion to the underlyinggeneticevolutionthatexplainsthem. ThusMrWilson wouldexpand the mantra ofTheodosiusDobz-hansky, a greatgeneticist: “Nothingin biol-ogymakessense exceptin the lightof evo-lution” to “Nothingin science and thehumanitiesmakessense exceptin the lightofevolution.” Where MrWilson focuseson the ori-ginsofcreativity, AnthonyBrandtand David Eagleman, a composerand a neuro-scientist, focusin “The RunawaySpecies”on the actofcreation. The bookmakes asingle argument, clearlyand thoroughly:creativityisneverthe creation ofsome-thingfrom nothing. Instead, consciously ornot, people refashion things. Theydo thisforthe mostpartin three ways: bybending,breakingand blending. Bendinginvolvestakingsomethingand alteringa property.Breakinginvolvestakinga whole apartand assemblingsomethingnewfrom thefragments. And blendinginvolvesmixingmultiple sourcestogetherin newways.“The RunawaySpecies” isnotshortofexamples. Forbreaking, the authorscite Cubism, shotgun sequencingofDNA andphotomontage in ﬁlm. Forblending, theminotaurand the mermaid, geneticsplicingand creole languages. And forbending, the authorspointto the artiﬁcialheart. Atﬁrst, scientistscopied the heartascloselyastheycould, beatingand all. Butbeatingled to wearand tear—and wasunnecessary, asthe heartsimplyneeds topump blood. Todaytransplantpatients aregiven continuous-ﬂowhearts. (Itturns outthatDickCheney, who had a hearttrans-plantatthe age of71, hasnothad a heart-beatsince 2010.) In a way, Keatswasright: applying sci-entiﬁcscrutinyto the artsrunsthe riskoffeelinglike an autopsy. Both these books,though, skirtaround thatdanger. MessrsWilson and Eagleman themselvesare bothscientistsand novelists—livingembodi-mentsofthe fallacythatthere are two dis-tinctcultures. Both “The OriginsofCreativ-ity” and “The RunawaySpecies” approachcreativityscientiﬁcallybutsensitively, feel-ingitsrootswithoutpullingthem out.7“INTHE beginningwasthe Word…”Thatstirringopeningofthe Gospel ofStJohn could easilyserve asthe thesis ofMartin Puchner’s“The Written World”, anepisodichistoryofhuman civilisation asshaped byand told through itsliterature. MrPuchner, a professoratHarvard Uni-versity, placesthe written word atthe veryheartofthings, bringingscribesand scrib-blersoutfrom the shadowsand givingthem theirmomentin the sun. When discussingAlexander’sastoundingcon-quests, the authorhasfarlessto say abouthisinnovative use ofcavalrythan aboutthe factthathe carried around with him atextofHomer’s“Iliad”, a bookthatgoadedthe greatMacedonian to surpasstheachievementsofhishero Achilles. Re-countingthe transformative impactofBuddha, Confucius, Socratesand Jesus, MrPuchnerchoosesto focusnoton the ethicalcontentoftheirwordsbuton the waythose wordswere broadcastto the worldbydiscipleswho wrote them down. Thisapproach isoften instructive, al-lowingthe readerto see familiareventsthrough a diﬀerentlens. DiscussingtheProtestantReformation, MrPuchnerright-lyplacestexts—and the relativelynew (toEurope, atleast) technologyofprinting—squarelyatthe centre: “Luther, the poormonkwho wasmerelypointingoutabuses, who waslearninghowto speak toand forcommon people, managed to acquire more authoritythan the pope because he wasan author; the pope wasonlythe pope,” he writes. He isalso per-ceptive aboutthe waysin which the explo-sive growth oftextsin the real worldlooped backinto literature, transformingthe imaginative life ofboth writersandreaders. OfDon Quixote, he observes:“Cervanteshad realised thatthe prolifera-tion ofstoriesthrough printmeantthatmore and more people sawthe worldthrough literature. In a way, everyone wasaDon Quixote, theirheadsalive with plotsand characters.” MrPuchnerisa clear-eyed and helpfulguide. Ironicallyfora bookthatisall aboutliterature, he largelyeschewsliterary ﬂour-ishes, writingwith a simplicitythat ismoreserviceable than inspired. Accountsof histravelsin search ofliteraryorigins—fromthe ruinsofTroyto the Istanbul ofOrhanPamuk, from the junglesofsouthern Mexi-co in search ofa Zapatista rebel called Sub-comandante Marcosto the island ofSt Lucia to commune with DerekWalcott—provide local colourbutrarelyanypiercinginsights.Alargerproblem isthatthe writtenword’stentacleshave reached so deeplyinto the collective consciousnessofman-kind thattheyhave become almostsyn-onymouswith civilisation itself. MrPuchner’stopicisatonce so vastand soamorphousthatattimesitishard to knowexactlywhatthisbookisabout. Almostall the author’sdiscussionsareilluminatingbut, in the end, theyappear tobe linked byno compellingidea ororganis-ingprinciple. Writingisso ingrained in human consciousnessand so intertwinedwith people’simaginative livesthatany attemptto single outitsimpacton thecourse ofhistoryisbound eitherto end inbland generalitiesorto be marked by arbitraryselectivity. MrPuchnershows anadmirable breadth ofinterests, ascomfort-able discussingthe Mayan Popol Vuh andsamizdat(the underground pressofthe SovietUnion) ashe iswith the classics ofthe Western canon. Buthe neveroﬀers aunifyingtheme. “The Written World”worksbetterasa seriesofinteresting, iflooselyconnected, vignettesthan asa revelation ofliterature’suniquelytrans-formative role.7Literature and historyThe shapingofwordsThe Written World: How Literature ShapedHistory.By Martin Puchner.

Faber and Faber; £12.99ONOCTOBER21st1916 Friedrich Adler,atheoretical physicistturned socialistpolitician, wentto a famousrestaurant inVienna and ate a three-course lunch. Hav-inglingered overcoﬀee, he wentup to Karlvon Stürgkh, the imperial prime minister,who wassittingata nearbytable, and shothim several timeswith a pistol, killing him.Adler, the son ofthe legendaryfounder ofAustro-Hungarian social democracy, calm-lywaited to be arrested. Somethinghad tobe done to change the general wayofthinking, he claimed, and he had done it.Atﬁrstcondemned to death, he waspar-doned two yearslater. When the Naziscame to powerin Aus-tria, Adler, bythen the secretaryof the So-cialistWorkers’ International, held urgentmeetingswith othersocialistpoliticians toworkouta common strategy. Duringoneofthese meetings, an emotional Adlerrambled on, seeminglyunable to come tothe point. “He shootsbetterthan he talks,”one French delegate remarked drily. “ExactThinkingin Demented Times”, Karl Sig-mund’sfond and knowledgeable explora-tion ofthe ideasand membersofthe leg-endaryVienna circle between the twoworld wars, containsstarkwarningsnotonlyaboutdemented times, butalso aboutthe possible costsofexactthinking. The Vienna circle wasmade up mainlyofphysicists, mathematiciansand philos-ophers, whose fortnightlymeetingswerededicated to investigatingproblemsof log-ic, science, language and mathematics. LedbyMoritzSchlick, a philosopher, the dis-cussionsattracted some brilliantintellec-tuals, includingKurtGödel, a mathemati-cian; Otto Neurath, an economist; threephilosophers—RudolfCarnap, SirKarl Pop-perand Ludwigvon Wittgenstein (pic-tured, whose workbecame the main focusofthe discussionsfora while)—aswell asAlbertEinstein and Bertrand Russell.Debatesaboutthe possibilityofa uni-ﬁed science, the dangerousvagariesofeverydaylanguage orthe structuresofmathematicsand logicraged on formorethan two decades. These arguments,which seemed so abstract, produced in-sightsofvital importance forcomputing,astrophysicsand cosmology, notto men-tion theoryofscience and philosophy. MrSigmund devotesa considerable partofthe bookto explainingsome ofthese con-cepts. Readersunable to grasp them imme-diatelyare in good company. “Mostschol-arsagree”, he writes, “thatneitherWittgenstein norRussell everreallyunder-stood Gödel’sideas.”These rigorousdiscussionswere at theouteredgesofwhatcould then be thoughtand calculated. Thisclevercircle wasmarked byeccentricities, disagreementsand rivalries, and othermore serious pro-blems. Two ofitsmemberscommitted sui-cide. Gödel, who wasparanoid aboutbe-ingpoisoned, eventuallystarved himselfto death afterhe leftforAmerica. In the end, the demented timespre-vailed overexactthinking, and MrSig-mund’scolourful panorama isneatlybookended byanothermurder, mirroringAdler’sact. When Austria fell underhome-grown fascistrule in 1933, the daysofthe Vienna circle were numbered. Even beforethe Anschlussin 1938, several ofitsmem-bershad to ﬂee, carryingthe debate intonewcontexts. Schlick, who wasnotJew-ish, chose to remain in Vienna. In 1936 he wasgunned down on thephilosophers’ staircase ofthe university.Hismurdererwasa paranoid formerstu-dentwho had stalked him formonths, andwho sympathised with fascism. The killer,who, itturned out, had acted outofmis-guided sexual jealousy, quicklybecame ahero ofthe nationalistrightand was of-fered an amnesty18 monthslaterbythenewNational Socialistmasters. Betweenthe two crimesof(possiblydemented)conscience, MrSigmund describesa worldofintellectual endeavour. Barringthe oddstylisticinfelicity, he handleshismaterialwell.

Income inequality, and a free-trade area forAfrica, youmightexpect.Those were the subjectshe taughtatHar-vard: gettingpoorercountries, especially inAfrica, to growand thrive wasthe obses-sion ofhislife. Buthe also tweeted aboutawheelchairthatcould climb stairs, the in-creasingsize ofsteaks, and the maximumnumberofgoatsseen eatingup in a tree. Hewasextra-delighted to send outa NewYorkTimeseditorial, from 1878, aboutThomasEdison’snew“aerophone”: “Somethingoughtto be done aboutMrEdison, andthere isa growingconviction thatit hadbetterbe done with a hemp rope.”Human beingsalwaysresisted change.He demonstrated this, on YouTube, byholdingup a mugofcoﬀee, opposed onsafetygroundsforaround 200 years. Re-frigeration had been foughtagainst; marga-rine had been coloured pink, bylaw, sothatconsumerscould rejectit. Closer to hisown life, in the remote litterofmud hutsonLake Victoria in Kenya where he hadgrown up one of14 children, villagershadinitiallyrejected the cassava cuttings hisfa-therhad introduced, thinkingthe un-known tuberswould breed demons. Infact, in thatﬂood-prone corner, they en-sured a stable food supply. Innovation inAfrica, he had learned from thatexample,had to be “evolutionary”. Everyone—smallholders, herders, merchants—had tobe involved and convinced itwould work. Progresswould come, he wassure. Buthismanybooksand papersshowed howfarthere wasto go. In 2011“The NewHar-vest” noted that75% ofAfrica’sfarmland,the mainspringofeconomicactivity, wasstarved ofnutrients. Only4% ofcroplandwasirrigated; fertiliseruse was10% oftheworld average. The cryingneed wasforleadership, integration and innovation, inthatorder. Governments, scientists, entre-preneursand farmershad to co-operate toimprove cropsand yields, build roads togetproduce to markets, and generally in-vest. Hisfavourite example wasBingu waMutharika, presidentofMalawi, who gavesubsidiesto farmersforimproved seedsand fertiliser; yieldsrose so much that, intwo years, Malawi wasa netexporteroffood. Whynotdo thateverywhere? He advised several African leaders, andfound them receptive. In 2012, sixofthemwere engineers—an encouragingfactfor aman who had spenthisboyhood Sundaysmendingvillagers’ radios, and called thatthe onlyreal job he had everdone. It wasgovernmentministries, and theirturfwars, thatfrustrated him. HisAfrican Cen-tre forTechnologyStudies, setup in Nairo-bi, wasamongthe ﬁrston the continent tobringresearchersand policymakersto-gether. He had been softeningup Kenya forawhile: asa youngteacherin Mombasa heso bombarded the DailyNationwith witand ideasthathe became itsﬁrstsciencecorrespondent, and wenton proselytising,justasperkily, from there. Hisown pro-gress, from a school withoutwateror pow-erto SussexUniversity, the United Nationsand Harvard, surelyshowed whathiscon-tinentcould do, with eﬀortand a push.Africa wasa laggard, outstripped byeverywhere else. Butlaggardshad advan-tages, too. Theycould take whatothers hadinvented and run with it—leapfrogging, ashe called it. The storyofmobile phones inAfrica greatlyfuelled hisoptimism. Herewasan invention people loved ratherthanfeared, so thatKenya (with hishelp) be-came one ofthe ﬁrstcountriesto usesmartphonesformoneytransfer, and herd-ersin Somalia nowexchanged and trackedtheirgoatsbypaintingthem with their mo-bile numbers. He enjoyed startinglectureswith a picture ofthose goats; thoughproperleapfrogging, he insisted, still need-ed power-linesand roads.Aswith phones, so with agriculturaltechnology. Africa, he wrote, contained60% ofthe world’savailable arable land. Italso contained, in sharp contrastto mono-cultureselsewhere, a vastrange ofindige-nouscrops. Manyofthese, longadapted toarid conditions, could help feed the worlddespite climate change. Africa wasa reser-voirofbiodiversity, and the nextstep wasto ensure thatthe storingofseeds, and re-search into them, became the business ofAfrican governments, universitiesandfarmers. Perhapshismostsatisfyingstintwasasthe ﬁrstexecutive secretaryof theUNconvention on biodiversityof1992—ineﬀectan African safeguarderofthat vastand endangered geneticlibrary, still hardlycatalogued and still largelyunread. Whatfarmers needGeneticmodiﬁcation held no fearsforhim. Modiﬁed seeds, resistantto droughtand pests, were justwhatAfrica needed.Gene research induced plantsto releasetheirsecretsofsuccess. Ifover-producingEuropeansdid notwantthisnewtool, ﬁne;buttheyhad no rightto limitfarmers’choicesin Africa. When GMOswere re-stricted bythe Cartagena protocol, signedin 2000, he leftthe UNin protestatits pessi-mism and “technological intolerance”. There wasplentyofthatabout, in thedeveloped world asmuch asin Africa. Hislife wasspentresistingit, grasping newin-ventionsand initiativesjoyouslyand withboth hands. Lighthearted ashe was, hisconstantmessage to Africa wasalso a sternone, and more succinctthan mostofhistweets: Innovate orperish. 7Seeds ofchangeCalestous Juma, tireless advocate forinnovation in Africa, died on December 15th,aged 64ObituaryCalestous JumaYet to subscribe?
