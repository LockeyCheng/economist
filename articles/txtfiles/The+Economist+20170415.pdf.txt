Forcenturiesitwasthe seatofa greatempire.Today, asa frontierstate, itmustcope with the violence spewingoutofwar-ravaged Syria; it isatestcase ofwhetherdemocracycan be reconciled with politi-cal Islam; and itmustnavigate between Western liberalismand the authoritarian nationalism epitomised byRussia. In re-centyearsunderRecep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkeyhasgone back-wards. Thisweekend itcan begin to putthatright.On April 16th Turkswill vote in a referendum overwhetherto abandon theirparliamentarysystem foran executive presi-dency. AYesislikely, butfarfrom certain. There is nothingwrongwith a strongpresident, butTurkey’snewconstitutiongoestoo far. The countrywould end up with a 21st-centurysul-tan minimallycurbed byparliament(see pages17-20). AYeswould condemn Turkeyto the elected dictatorship ofPresi-dentErdogan. ANo mightjustletTurksconstrain him.AuthorityﬁgureAfterMrErdogan came to powerin 2003, he and hisAKpartydid a lotthatwasgood. Encouraged bythe IMF, he tamed inﬂa-tion and ushered in economicgrowth. Encouraged bythe EU,he tackled the cabal ofmilitaryoﬃcersand bureaucrats in the“deep state”, strengthened civil libertiesand talked peace withthe Kurds. He also spoke up forworking-classreligious conser-vatives, who had been locked outofpowerfordecades.ButtodayTurkeyisbesetbyproblems. In the shadow oftheSyrian civil war, jihadistsand Kurdish militantsare wagingcampaignsagainstthe state. Lastsummerthe armyattemptedacoup—probablyorganised bysupportersofan American-based cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who had penetrated the bu-reaucracy, judiciaryand armyin theirtensofthousands. Theeconomy, once a strength, isgrowingslowly, plagued by crony-ism, poormanagementand a collapse in tourism.MrErdogan arguesthat, to putthisright, Turkeyneeds anewconstitution thatwill generate political stability. He saysthatonlya strongpresidentcan galvanise the state and see oﬀitsenemies. Naturally, he istalkingabouthimself.The newconstitution embodiesthe “illiberal democracy”ofnationalistssuch asViktorOrban ofHungaryand VladimirPutin ofRussia, to whom MrErdogan isincreasinglycom-pared. On thisview, election winnerstake all, constraints areobstaclesto stronggovernmentand the rulingpartyhas a rightto subvertinstitutions, such asthe judiciaryand the press. Yetthiskind ofstabilityishollow. The mostsuccessful de-mocraciesmake a pointofseparatingpowersand slowinggovernmentsdown. The guidingidea ofthe American consti-tution isto stop presidentsfrom actingasiftheywere mon-archs, bybuildingin checksand balances. Even the Britishprime minister, untrammelled bya written constitution, hastosubmitherselfto the courts, a mercilesspressand a weeklygrillingin Parliament, broadcastlive.Turkeyisespeciallyill-suitedtowinner-takes-allgovern-ment. Itisdivided between secular, religiousand nationalistcitizens, aswell asTurks, Kurds, Alevisand a fewremainingGreeks, Armeniansand Jews. Ifthe religious-conservativenear-majoritytryto shutouteveryone else, justasthey wereonce shutout, Turkeywill neverbe stable.Butthe mostimportantargumentagainstmajoritarian poli-ticsisMrErdogan himself. Since the failed coup, he hasbeengoverningundera state ofemergencythatdemonstrates howcruellypowercan be abused. The state isentitled to protectitscitizens, especially in theface ofpolitical violence. ButMrErdogan hasgone far beyondwhatisreasonable. Roughly50,000 people have been arrest-ed; 100,000 more have been sacked. Onlya fraction ofthemwere involved in the coup. Anyone MrErdogan seesasa threatisvulnerable: ordinaryfolkwho wentto a Gulenistschool orsaved with a Gulenistbank; academics, journalistsand politi-cianswho betrayanysympathyforthe Kurdish cause; any-body, includingchildren, who mocksthe presidenton socialmedia. Whateverthe resulton April 16th, MrErdogan will re-main in charge, free to use—and abuse—hisemergencypowers.Duringthe campaign he accused the Germansand Dutchof“Nazi practices” forstoppinghisministersfrom pitching forexpatriate votes. EUvoiceswantto suspend accession talks—which, in anycase, are moribund. Before long, the talk mayeven turn to sanctions. Some in the Westwill pointto Turkey’sexperience to claim thatIslam and democracycannotcoexist.Butto give up on thatidea would be to give up on Turkey itself.The faultisnotso much with political Islam—manyAKmembersand votersare uneasywith the newconstitution. Itiswith MrErdogan and hisinnercircle. Although he is a reli-giousman, he isbetterseen asan old-fashioned authoritarianthan asa new-fangled Islamist. The distinction matters be-cause AK, oran Islamistpartylike it, isbound to feature in Tur-key’sdemocracy. MrErdogan, however, will one dayleave thestage, takinghisauthoritarian instinctswith him. Hold him closeHence the outside world should notgive up on Turkey, butbepatient. Partly, thisisself-interest. Asa NATOmemberand a re-gional power, Turkeyistoo importantto cutadrift. It will play avital partin anypeace in Syria. Drivingitinto Russia’sarmsmakesno sense. Turkeyhasalso been a conduitforrefugeesinto the EU aswell asvital in controllingtheirinﬂow. The refu-gee situation isin ﬂux: the EUwill need to keep talkingto Tur-keyabouthowto cope with the resultinginstability.Engagementisalso in Turkey’sinterests. The EU isitsbiggesttradingpartner. Contactwith itbolstersthe Western-leaningTurkswho are likelyto be MrErdogan’smostpotentopposi-tion. NATOmembership can moderate the nextgeneration ofoﬃcersin itsarmed forces. Although Turkeywill not join theEUformanyyears, ifever, a looserEU, with several classes ofmemberorassociate country, mightone dayﬁnd room for it. Turkeywill remain pivotal afterApril 16th. IfMrErdoganloses, Turkeywill be a diﬃcultallywith a diﬃcult future. But ifhe wins, he will be able to govern asan elected dictator. 7TheslideintodictatorshipRecep Tayyip Erdogan is carrying outthe harshestcrackdown in decades.

Theirdestination: school.The photographerwastold by alocal oﬃcial that“seven oreight” people had died afterlosingtheirgrip. Yetthe children did thisregularly—there isno schoolatthe top ofthe mountain in Sichuan province where theylive. The photographsconveyed two strikingaspectsof life inthe Chinese countryside: a hungerforeducation so strong thatchildrenwillrisktheirlivesforit,andacallouslack ofgovern-mentattention to the needsofrural students. In manyways, education in China isimproving. Since 2000the annual tallyofstudentsgraduatingfrom university hasin-creased nearlyeightfold, to more than 7.5m. Butmanyrural stu-dentsare neglected byChina’sschool system, and theyare notthe onlyones.

Thatcallsforbettereducation.The governmenthasnotbeen completelyblind to the needto ensure thatrural people have enough schoolingto work infactories, butithasshown little sense ofurgency. The school-children from Sichuan are a case in point. So perilous wastheirjourneyto school thatoﬃcialsarranged forthem to board, liketensofmillionsofchildren in rural China. Theytravel backhome onlyeveryfewweeks. Thatmaysound like progress. Since the population ofyoungpeople in the countryside isfallingso smaller schoolsare closing. Betterto board than to trekformilesevery daytoone thatisstill open. Butconditionsatthese boarding schoolsare often appalling(see page 37). Manychildren do notgetenough to eat, which aﬀectstheirhealth and theirability tolearn. So pooristheirnutrition thattheyare often shorterthantheircounterpartsatdayschools. And itisnotjustthe boarderswho suﬀer. In all kinds ofedu-cation, rural children have lesschance ofdoingwell than theirurban counterparts. Lessthan 10% ofthem go to seniorhigh-school, compared with 70% oftheirpeersin cities. Thatis be-cause the governmentstacksthe system againstthem.Everyone in China hasto attend school fornine years—untilthe end ofjuniorhigh school. Butitwasnotuntil 2007 thatallrural children could do so withoutpaying. Like citydwellers,theystill have to payforseniorhigh school. Buttheir familiestend to be much poorer, so fewcan aﬀord it. And rural schoolsare farmore rudimentary. Local governmentsare responsibleforrunningthem. Ifoﬃcialshave taxrevenue to spare, theysee no pointin dolingitoutin the countryside. How can youboostgrowth, theywonder, byspendingmoneyon villagerswho will eventuallymove away? Itisno betterforthe migrantsonce theyare in the cities. Chi-na’shousehold-registration system, known ashukou, treatsru-ral migrantsassecond-classcitizens. Theirchildren are oftenbarred from state-funded urban schools. Theymustpay tosend them to ramshackle private onesinstead, which are oftenworse than rural state schools. Even there, children’seduca-tion isfrequentlydisrupted: oﬃcialshave forced many suchplacesto close, citingsafetyand otherconcerns.Who’s blocking the schoolhouse door?People with rural hukou make up nearly60% ofthe popula-tion. So itisvital thatthe system isscrapped. Everyone in Chi-na deservesthe same accessto publiceducation, health careand otherservices. The central governmentmustalso do moreto ensure thatrural schoolshave enough moneyto teach andfeed theirpupils—basiceducation istoo importantto be lefttoill-motivated local authorities. And itmustgive more ﬁnancialsupportto the rural poorin orderto help theirchildren gradu-ate from high school and enteruniversity. People from the countryside are the unsungheroesof Chi-na’seconomicrise. The migration ofmore than 200m oftheminto cities, where theirlabourismore productive than itisinthe ﬁelds, hasbeen the rocketfuel ofthe country’sspectaculargrowth. In China, aselsewhere, education iswhatwill makesocietyfairer, and ultimatelywealthier. 712LeadersTheEconomistApril15th20172WHATwouldGandhihavemade ofAadhaar, the am-bitiousscheme to provide eachofIndia’s1.3bn residentswith aunique, biometricallyveriﬁableidentiﬁcation? There ismuchthatmighthave impressed thegreatpaciﬁst.

In time, theyshould help hundreds ofmillionsofIndiansenterthe formal, modern economy.YetGandhi mightalso have been alarmed. Afterall, he cuthispolitical teeth resistinga scheme to impose identity passeson unwillingIndians. Thatwasovera centuryago, in South Af-rica. Aadhaarcould scarcelybe furtherremoved in intent fromcolonial racism: itisdesigned to include and unite, notexclude.Still, manyIndiansworrythata programme billed asvolun-taryisincreasingly, with little publicdebate, being made man-datory. Thisputsthe whole project, and all itsbeneﬁts, atriskofbeingstruckdown bythe courts.

In recentmonthsthe governmentofNarendra Modi, theprime minister, hasmade accessto a dozen government pro-grammescontingenton possession ofan Aadhaarcard (seepage 32). In March itsneakilyinserted into a fast-tracked bud-getbill a rule thatrequirestaxpayersto linktheir taxnumberwith Aadhaar. There istalkofaddingsuch thingsasschoollunchesand the purchase ofairline ticketsto thislist. In an-swerto a question in parliamentaboutwhetherthe state was,in eﬀect, forcingcitizensinto the Aadhaarscheme, the replyfrom India’sministerofﬁnance wasblunt: “Yes, we are.”Thiswould appearto contradictIndia’sSupreme Court.

MrModi’sgovernment,with itsstridentnationalism and occasional recklessness—such aslastyear’sabruptvoidingofmostofthe papercurren-cyin circulation—doesnotalwaysinspire conﬁdence that itwill respectcitizens’ rightsand legal niceties. Bysneaking thelinkage between Aadhaarand taxinto a budgetbill, it raisesconcernsaboutintent: will the governmentstalktaxevaders,orperhapsenemiesofthe state, usingostensibly“ﬁre-walled”Aadhaardata? ManyIndianswill rememberthat, followingsectarian riotsin the past, rulingpartieswere accused ofusingvoterrollsto targetvictims.MrModi, who before takingoﬃce dismissed Aadhaar asa“political gimmick”, hasbeen rightto seize on itspotential totransform India. Itcan bringmore eﬃciencyto government,convenience to citizensand savingsto businessesthat need toidentifytheircustomers. ButforAadhaarto fulﬁl its potential,Indiansmusttrustthatitwill notbe misused. Adopting coer-cive regulations, ignoringthe Supreme Court’squalmsanddismissingcriticsperemptorilywill achieve the opposite. Asforthe Supreme Court, itshould stop ditheringand make itsviewsclear.

Eversince MrErdogan tookpower, the countryhasbeen a testofwhathappenswhen de-mocracyisputtogetherwith political Is-lam. Turkeywasalso an example ofthe be-nign inﬂuence ofthe European Union,which encouraged open marketsand civilrights. Some yearsago MrErdogan beganto rejectall thatfornationalism and auto-cracy.

He would use a Yesas apopularendorsementofthatilliberal path.Since MrErdogan hasall the advan-tages, anythingbuta resoundingvictoryoughtto countasa defeat.

Foreign investmentsoared. Thecountrybecame Europe’sworkshop.Thanksto theirnewfound stability, Turkishentrepreneursgrewrich. Change the systemMrErdogan wantsvotersto believe thatSunday’sreferendum isall aboutrecover-ingthisstability. Sittingin the AKoﬃce inBasaksehir, Mustafa Sentop, who helpeddraftthe newconstitution, arguesthat aman ofMrErdogan’scalibre hasaccom-plished thingsin powerdespite the sys-tem, notbecause ofit. In its94 yearsasa re-public, Turkeyhashad 65 governments.Shadowyoligarchieshave inﬁltrated thearmyand the bureaucracyin ordertousurp elected politicians. There isa historyofterrorism, plotsand coups. “We will stopthat,” MrSentop vows.Formally, the newconstitution abolish-esthe prime minister’soﬃce and dividespowerbetween parliament, which legis-lates, and the president, who acts. In prac-tice, itenthronesthe presidentasa term-limited sultan and parliamentashiscourt. MrSentop pointsoutthatFrance andthe United Stateshave powerful presi-dents, too. Butunderthe newconstitution,unlike the Assemblée Nationale and Con-gress, the Turkish parliamentwill not con-trol the detailsofspendingorhave a sayoverpresidential appointments. Neitherwill itbe able to subjectthe cabinet toquestions, exceptin writing. Besides, inFrance and America the independence ofthe media and the courtsiswell-estab-lished. In TurkeyMrErdogan hasspent re-centyearsturningthem into hisﬁefs.The chancesare thatthe president willdominate parliamentpolitically, too. Be-cause executive and legislative electionswill coincide, unlike those in France andAmerica, where theyare notalwaysaligned, the presidentand the parliamen-tarymajorityare likelyto come from thesame party. Turkeyoperatesa listsystem,in which partyleaderscontrol who gets aseat. The newconstitution allowsMrErdo-gan to retain control ofhisparty, giving himpowerto handpickparliamentarycandi-dates. Those who challenge him wouldpaya high price.The reform hasmetstrongcriticismabroad. The Venice Commission, a panelofconstitutional expertswho advise theCouncil ofEurope, callsit“a dangerousstep backwards”, sayingthatthe newcon-stitution “lacksthe necessarychecksandbalancesto safeguard againstbecoming anauthoritarian” regime. Human RightsWatch, an NGO, saysthatitposes“a hugethreatto human rights, the rule oflaw andthe country’sdemocraticfuture”.Within Turkey, however, voters’ percep-tionsare coloured bythe terrorattacks andthe attempted coup. The outside world hasfailed to grasp justhowbesieged Turks feel.And thathasstrengthened MrErdogan.Firstcame the spiral ofterrorand retri-bution. Earlyon, MrErdogan had beenreadyto make peace with the Kurds. Per-hapsbecause hispeople had also suﬀeredunderTurkey’sseculargovernments, orbecause he stood to win votesamongcon-servative Kurds, he oﬀered newrights andapromise to resolve a 30-yearwarbe-tween securityforcesand the PKK, a Kurd-ish militia. Laterhe sawthem aspotentialalliesoverthe constitution. With their sup-port, he would win hisexecutive presiden-cyand theywould gain autonomyin thesouth-east, where theyare in the majority. Butpeace talkswith the PKKfell apart in2015. Kurdish successﬁghtingwith theAmericansagainstIslamicState (IS) in Syr-ia raised theirhopesofa homeland in Tur-key. AfterMrDemirtastold him in early2015 thathe would nevergethisnewcon-stitution, a furiousMrErdogan disownedthe peace process. When the PKK blamedhim fora deadlyISbombingagainstpro-Kurdish activistsand killed two Turkishpolicemen, MrErdogan launched an oﬀen-sive againstitsbasesin northern Iraq, ac-companied bymassarrests. Aspiral of PKKbombingsagainstTurkish securityforcesand ruthlessarmyreprisalsrocked thesouth-east. Underpressure in Syria, IScon-tinued unleashingitsown suicide-bom-bersagainstTurkey.Guns and steelAfterthe terrorism came the putsch. MostTurksthoughttheyhad consigned militarycoupsto history. Buton the nightof July15th lastyearrebel troopsstationed tanksatIstanbul’smain airport, occupied TaksimSquare and tookup positionson the twobridgescrossingthe Bosporus. Theyputtheirtop commandersunderarrest. In thecapital, Ankara, theirjetsbombed the par-liamentbuildingand the groundsofthepresidential palace. Butwithin hoursthe coup collapsed. Asquad attacked the hotel in Marmariswhere MrErdogan had been on holiday—buthe wasalreadygone. In a remarkabledisplayofpeople power, Turkspouredonto the streetsto defend civilian rule. MrErdogan hasseized on the violenceto whip up a frenzyofparanoia and na-tionalism. He hasmemorialised the bun-gled coup, in which almost250 peopledied, asTurkey’ssecond warofindepen-dence—settinghimselfup asthe equal ofthe republic’sfounder, Mustafa Kemal Ata-turk(see boxon nextpage).Behind the crude myth-makinglies theparanoia—which hasatleastone footin re-ality.

He stood byas theGulenistsdestroyed theirenemiesin showtrialsorthrough smearcampaignsin theirnewspapersand television stations.InevitablyMrErdogan and MrGulenturned on each other, usingthe methodsthatthe deep state had once used againstthem. The detailsare murky, butthe ﬁrstblowmayhave been a Gulenistattempt toarrestMrErdogan’sintelligence chiefin2012. The two men became locked in a ﬁghtforsurvival aftersomeone released tapedconversationsimplicatingMrErdogan andhisfamilyin corruption—which he strenu-ouslydenies. Havingcompiled a roster ofsuspected Gulenistsin the army, MrErdo-gan wasaboutto swoop. The plotters,joined bysome secularists, struckﬁrst.Faced with an enemywithin and sepa-ratistsand terroristswithout, MrErdoganhad a dutyto strike back, sayAK politi-cians. “Nowhere in the world issupportingterrorism acceptable,” saysRavza KavackiKan, an MPforIstanbul. And so, in the name ofdemocracyandthe rule oflaw, MrErdogan unleashed awhirlwind. In the south-east, between July2015 and the end oflastyear, several thou-sand people losttheirlives—800 ofthemgovernmentforces. The ﬁghtingdisplacedhundredsofthousands. Entire districtswere ﬂattened byartilleryand bulldozersbecause, the governmentsays, theywerebooby-trapped. Politically, the crackdownpaid oﬀ. Denied a majorityin parliamentin an election in June 2015, AKregained itﬁve monthslater. The governmenthassince expanded the crackdown, jailingthousandsofKurdish activists, including 13MPs, and kickingoutthe mayorsofover 80towns, on the ground thattheyhave ties tothe PKK. Since the coup the police have arrestedorsacked 168 generals—abouthalfthe total,amongthem manyclose to NATO—someforbeingtoo slowto come outin supportofMrErdogan. The judiciaryhaslost 4,000members. About6,300 academicsare outofa job orin jail, several hundred for sign-ingan open letterobjectingto the counter-insurgencycampaign in the south-east.Roughly160 media outletshave closed,manyofthem backersofMrGulen. Withinsixmonthsofthe coup, police had de-tained some 4,000 social-media users.And so itgoeson.On the wrong side ofthe stateManypeople caughtup in the mania didnotdeserve it.

On March30th 21journalistssuspected ofbeingGu-lenistswere acquitted. Afteran outcry byAK supportersall the journalistswere re-arrested before theycould leave prison, 13ofthem on newchargesof“attemptingtooverthrow” the government. The judgeswho heard the case were dismissed. ForemergencyuseSafakPavey, an opposition MP, arguesthatMrErdogan hasweaponised hisemergen-cypowers. “The lawisonlybeingusedagainstus,” she says, “notto provide justiceforeveryone. Foreign policyhasbeenweaponised, too, perhapsbecause MrEr-dogan thinksthe referendum resultis indoubt. AfterGermanyand the Nether-landsrefused to acceptgovernmentminis-terscampaigningfora YesamongTurks intheircountries, MrErdogan accused themof“Nazi practices”. The Dutch, he said, hadmurdered Muslimsin Srebrenica duringthe Balkan wars. No matterthattheywerein factUNpeacekeeperswho killed no-body. MrErdogan iscalculatingthat, whenEuropeanshitback, patrioticTurkswill ral-lyto the ﬂag.Atthe same time, MrErdogan issignal-lingthathe isprepared to shifttowardsRussia. Thismaybe a ployto provoke theEU. Butitalso reﬂectshowthe army andthe bureaucracyare increasinglyin thrallto a “Eurasian” faction whose leadersspurn NATOand the Westand lookto aTurkish version ofthe nationalism that hasserved VladimirPutin. Although Turkeyshotdown a Russian warplane on the Syri-an borderand Russia’sambassadorto Tur-keywasassassinated lastyear, militaryand intelligence co-operation between thetwo countrieshasneverbeen so close. NATOisworried. So isthe EU, whichhasstrucka deal with TurkeyoverSyrianmigrantsand ismired in increasingly futiletalksoverTurkish membership. UnderMrErdogan, an essential allyin a troubled re-gion isdriftingaway.Given MrErdogan’spowertoday, whatdiﬀerence would victoryin the referen-dum make? Optimistsoutside Turkeyhopethatitwould inspire him to be conciliatoryin an attemptto unite the country. But he isbynature a bullyin a culture thatadmiresdisplaysofstrength. More probablyhewould use the chance to move againstthenextlotofenemies. Thatmayinclude thesecularopposition aswell assome bigwigsin hisown party.Constitutionally, MrErdogan would bealmostuntouchable. Aspresident, hewould have two ﬁve-yearterms(and, un-dersome circumstances, a third). He andhisalliesin parliamentwould be able toappointloyaliststo the mostseniorjudicialpanels, immunisinghim and hisfamilyagainstprosecution should corruption al-legationsresurface. Some thinkhe isgroominghisson-in-law, the energyminis-ter, ashisheir.And yet, MrErdogan would face obsta-cles. The talented administratorsofhis ear-lyyearshave gone, replaced byyes-menand second-raters. Economicgrowth was2.9% lastyear, halfitsrate in the early 2000s(see chart2). GDPperhead isstagnant.Withoutthe anchorsofthe IMFand the EU,Turkeyhasgraduallyshifted awayfrom theeconomicorthodoxythatworked so wellin the past. Inﬂation isover11%, the highestsince 2008. Ratherthan returningto economic re-form, the governmentispinningitshopesforrevivingthe economyon a sovereign-wealth fund ﬁnanced bystate sharehold-ingsand with up to $200bn to invest. Butthatislikelyonlyto increase MrErdogan’scontrol overthe economy, hardlya promis-ingsign—and notjustbecause ofincompe-tence. In recentyearscronyism, always aproblem, hasbecome steadilyworse. IfMrErdogan isvulnerable anywhere itishere. Unlike Russia, with itsoil, Turkeyneedsforeign exchange and investment.Corruption and political repression willdrive them away—even astheyeatup re-sources. Eventuallythe pain will fall on themerchantsand businesspeople who arethe backbone ofAKsupport. Already, there are signsthatMrErdo-gan’spopularityiswaning. “Chief”, abiopiceulogisinghiscareer, hasproved afailure with criticsand audiences. At a re-centperformance at11am in the town ofIz-mit, the boxoﬃce refused a cinema-goer aticket: he would have been the onlymem-berofthe audience. And ifMrErdogan loses? The conse-quencesofNo are harderto predict. A de-featofanykind would be a humiliation.ButTurkeywould still be underemergencyrule, givingthe presidentvastpower.Aheavydefeatcould embolden dissi-dentsand reformistswithin AK to attemptto restrain MrErdogan. Itwould also en-courage hisopponents. Afterthe repres-sion, dissidents, the media and ordinaryTurkswould leap atthe chance to speakout. “There isa wall ofsilence in this coun-try,” saysSelma Atabey, a formernurse andtrade-union member, sacked afterthecoup. “ANo in the referendum would helpbreakitdown.”Yes and NoAnarrowloss, however, mightlead Mr Er-dogan to take desperate measures. Amas-teratmanipulatingconﬂictto hisown ad-vantage, he could engineeranotherclashwith the Kurds. He could call an early elec-tion in the hope ofwinninga large major-ity. Some fearthathisgovernmentcouldputforward anothernewconstitution,with a fewcosmeticamendments. Thistime, with a bigenough majority, itwouldnotneed to go to a referendum.Whateverthe resulton April 16th, Tur-keyhasentered a darkperiod. Avote forYeswould saddle the countrywith anelected dictator.

MrClinton had admitted canoodlingwithMonica Lewinskythree daysearlier—hadhe taken hiscue from a recentHollywoodﬁlm, “Wagthe Dog”, in which a ﬁctionalpresidentinventsa warto shiftattentionfrom a sexscandal? Bycontrast, the strikesDonald Trump launched on the Shayratairbase in Syria on April 6th, which were ofsimilarlylimited size and ambition—de-signed to make a point, notwar—havebeen feted, on the leftand right, as a well-judged action bya commander-in-chiefwho maybe startingto ﬁnd hisfeet. HillaryClinton, MrTrump’sdefeated Democraticrival, said she would have acted similarly.“Donald Trump became president!” saidFareed Zakaria, a liberal pundit, on CNN.The contrastingresponsesto thesestrikes, almosttwo decadesapart, illus-trate the extentto which foreign policy isoften judged more on itsdomesticpoliticalcontextthan itsprospectsofsuccess. MrClinton’spoint, thatthe Islamistrulers inKabul and Khartoum should stop succour-ingOsama bin Laden, and MrTrump’s,thatBasharal-Assad should stop gassinghisfellowSyrians, both justiﬁed militaryaction. Visiblyupsetbytelevision imagesofdead Syrian children, MrTrump ex-plained hissalvo in a tone ofadmirablethe defence secretary, and RexTillerson,the secretaryofstate, are supportive ofthese changes; like MrMcMaster, they areexperienced managers, with orthodoxviewsand to varyingdegreesprojectanaura ofauthority, despite the factthat al-mostnone oftheirsubordinates, the politi-cal appointeesupon whom cabinetchiefsdepend, have been appointed.Theireﬀortshave also been assisted byreality, which hastended to make MrTrump’serstwhile foreign-policyimpulsesappearuntenable. Havingargued thatAmerica’sinterestswere bestserved byleavingMrAssad in place—and, forthesame reason, havingwarned BarackObama backin 2013 notto launch the mis-sile strike thathe nowblameshim for notlaunching—MrTrump found the televisedimagesofthe Syrian dictator’sattackonKhan Sheikhoun too repugnantto ignore.Havingrefused to criticise Russia’spresi-dent, VladimirPutin, whose authoritarianleadership MrTrump admires, he isnowdigestingreportsthatthe Russianshadwarningofthe attack, then bombed thehospital to which itsvictimshad been sentin an attemptto destroythe evidence.These pressures—able cabinetchiefsand a world lessamenable to majorfor-eign-policyrevisionsthan MrTrump sup-posed—will endure. So the driftto ortho-doxywill probablycontinue, butwith twoequallyimportantcaveats. First, MrTrump’swillingnessto take and abruptlyabandon radical positions, like the club-house commander-in-chiefhe resemblesin all waysexceptone (he actuallyis thecommander-in-chief), will still impinge onAmerican foreign policy. An almostun-trammelled preserve ofthe presidency, ittendsto reﬂectthe characterofits incum-bentmore than anyotherbranch ofpolicy-making: underMrClinton, foreign policywasingenious, butsometimestoo tactical;underMrBush, itwaswell-meaning, but moral outrage. “Even beautiful babieswere cruellymurdered in thisverybarbar-icattack,” he said. “No child ofGod shouldeversuﬀersuch horror.” YetMrTrump’sraid had two additional thingsgoingfor it.First, the modestmilitaryaction MrClinton preferred doesn’tlookso bad com-pared with whatfollowed. AfterGeorge W.Bush’scostlywars, then BarackObama’sfailure to enforce a “red-line” warningagainstMrAssad’schemical weaponsuse,manyAmericanswantto bloodythe Syri-an dictator’snose, butnotwar. Second,there isindeed evidence thatMrTrump isadoptinga more conventional foreign poli-cy. And almosteveryone who applaudedhismissile strike isdesperatelykeen, giventhe president’serstwhile indiﬀerence toAmerica’sinternational standingand inat-tention to geopolitics, to encourage that or-thodoxdrift. Forthe same reasons, how-ever, theyare liable to be disappointed.Acall from HRThe growingorthodoxycan be mainlyat-tributed to the inﬂuence ofMrTrump’sim-pressive national-securityteam. Atthe Na-tional SecurityCouncil, H.R. McMaster hasbeen cleaningshop followingthe enforcedexitofhisshort-lived predecessor, MichaelFlynn. Arespected Russia analyst, FionaHill, hasbeen hired. MrMcMaster’sdepu-ty, K.T. McFarland, a formerFoxNews talk-ing-head with scantqualiﬁcationsfor suchan importantrole, isbeingeased oﬀ to anuntaxingambassadorship.

Itwasduringthat racethathislife became entangled with that ofRebekah Mason, a married woman almost30 yearshisjuniorwhom he issaid to haveencountered in the Sunday-school class hetaught. She worked ashispresssecretary,then in hisadministration and on his land-slide re-election campaign in 2014.Afterthe release lastyearoftapes inwhich, amongotherendearments, MrBentleyrhapsodised abouttouchingMsMason’sbreasts, he insisted thatthey hadnothad a sexual relationship. The tapes, ithasemerged, were recorded byMsBentley,who after50 yearsofmarriage divorcedhim in 2015. Theirrelease setoﬀan eﬀort toimpeach the governor—which, despite thestate’scolourful political history, wouldhave been a ﬁrst. Aspartofthatprocess, onApril 7th the state House JudiciaryCom-mittee published a reportbyitsspecialcounsel, JackSharman. Ata hearingon themorningofthe resignation, MrSharmanargued thatalthough the racydetails ofthecase were reminiscentofBill Clinton’s, thegovernor’sbid to “advance hispersonal in-terestsoverthose ofthe state”, and his“in-creasinglydesperate conduct”, more close-lyresembled Richard Nixon’s.To facilitate hisrelationship with MsMason, alleged MrSharman, and then toconcealit,MrBentleymisusedstatere-sourcesand personnel. Learningofthe re-cordingsbefore theybecame public, he issaid to have become obsessed with track-ingthem down, deployingsecurityoﬃ-cialsto huntforthem and intimidate otherstaﬀmembers. He allegedlyschemed topunish hiswife’sassistant, HeatherHan-nah, whom he held responsible forthetapes, and smeared, then ﬁred the state’stop lawman,once a close friend. The testimonythatsupported those ac-cusationswasexcruciating. “RayCharlescould see whatwasgoingon,” one formeraide said ofthe relationship. The gover-nor’schildren reportedlythoughthe mightbe suﬀeringfrom dementia. He accidental-lysenthiswife a textmessage thatsaid, “Ilove youRebekah”. MsBentleywasable toread othermessageson an iPad that, un-beknown to the governor, wassynchro-nised with hisphone. “PoorRobert. PoorRebekah,” he texted MsMason on one oc-casion. “Blessourhearts,” she replied.“And otherparts.” PoorMsBentley. Dramaticasthe hearingwas, in the enditwasmoot. On April 5th the state ethicscommission had said thatitsown, separateinvestigation had found “probable cause”to believe MrBentleybroke the law, mostlyin relation to campaign-ﬁnance violationsthatitunearthed duringitsinquiry. Thatand MrSharman’sﬁndingsturned thestate’sRepublican leadersagainsthim.Meanwhile MrBentley’slawyerswere evi-dentlyhammeringouta deal underwhichhe pled guiltyto the misdemeanoursbutwill be spared furtherprosecution. Alongwith a suspended jail term, probation,communityservice and $7,000 in ﬁnes, hewasrequired to resign immediately. MrBentleyomitted to mention that de-tail in the sanctimoniousstatementhemade in the old state house chamber, be-neath a plaque commemoratingAla-bama’ssecession in 1861. He had “notal-waysmade the rightchoices,” he saideuphemistically. “He probablygotoﬀvery,veryeasy,” said Ed Henry, a representativewho ﬁled the articlesofimpeachment.God’s armourIn the oddlyfestive mood thatupheavalscan induce, the throngofjournalists andpoliticostrooped acrossthe capitol’shall-wayto the old Senate chamber, where KayIvey, the lieutenant-governor, washastilysworn in asMrBentley’ssuccessor. Apas-torasked God to “clothe herwith spiritualarmour”. She will need it. She isonly thesecond female governorofa state reluctantto return women to high oﬃce. (The ﬁrstwasLurleen Wallace, who in 1966 stood asasurrogate forhersegregationisthusbandGeorge and died after16 monthsin therole.) Moreovershe takesoveratwhat,even byAlabama’sstandards, isan excru-ciatinglyembarrassingmoment. MrBentley’sdemise meansthe statehaslostthe leadersofall three branches ofgovernmentin a matterofmonths. LastyearMichael Hubbard wasousted asSpeakerofthe House afterhisconvictionon ethicscharges(he isappealing). RoyMoore wassuspended aschiefjustice in arumpusoverhisrecalcitrantopposition togaymarriage. The reshuﬄe doesnotendthere. AfterJeﬀSessionsjoined DonaldTrump’scabinet, itfell to MrBentley tonominate hissuccessorin the Senate. Hechose LutherStrange, the state’sattorney-general—whose oﬃce wasinvestigatingMrBentley. Three ofAlabama’spastsixgo-vernorshave nowfaced criminal charges.Still, tawdryasithasbeen, the Bentleysaga hasitsheroes, and itsmorals. Accord-ingto hertestimony, MrBentleytold MsHannah, hiswife’sassistant, that“peoplefall atmythrone” and she had better“watch it”. She wasundaunted. Conﬁ-dantswhom he allegedlytried to enlist todo hisdirtyworkseem ultimatelyto haveattempted to restrain him.The dangerofalienatingfriendsis oneofthe lessonsofa debacle in which MrBentley, now74 and notthoughtindepen-dentlywealthy, hasforfeited notjust hiswife, job and reputation buthisretirementbeneﬁts. The othersare familiar, too. Yetagain the cover-up proved more damagingthan the original peccadillo.

Like medieval peasantswatchingknightsjoust, the yo-kelsand churlsofthe political village—lobbyists, consultants or(hold yournose) journalists—maynod and gawp atthe mighty,buttheirhope isto see one grandee thwackanotherinto the mud.These are, therefore, headytimesin the nation’scapital. Twopowerful men, Stephen Bannon, chiefstrategistto President Do-nald Trump, and Jared Kushner, a senioradviser, have been joust-ingforweeks, exchangingsword-swipesand lance-blowsvialeaksand brieﬁngsin the press. Still more blissfully forspectators,MrKushneristhe president’sson-in-law: the boyish, dashing heirto a familyofpropertytycoonsand Democraticdonors, and hus-band to MrTrump’sdaughterand trusted counsellor, Ivanka. Hisrival, MrBannon, isolderand angrier: a grizzled champion ofAmerica Firstnationalism.ThisWhite House tourneyisusuallypresented asa clash ofpartisan ideologyorasa human melodrama. Some complaintsfrom the Kushnercamp certainlyringwith dynasticalarm. Theultimate argumentagainstMrBannon, one unnamed source toldthe Washington Post, isthathishardline, ﬁre-up-the-faithful brandofpolitics“isn’tmaking‘Dad’ lookgood”. Fortheirpart, Bannon-itesinside governmentand theircheerleadersin the conservativemedia like to paintMrKushnerasa closetliberal, undercutting MrTrump’shistoricpopulistvictory. Theirire also takes in Ivanka, aswell asGaryCohn, the president’snational economicsadviser,and Dina Powell, a deputynational securityadviser, both ofthem veteransofGoldman Sachs, a bank(to complicate matters,MrBannon also once worked forGoldman Sachs, butmore re-centlyearned notorietyasthe rumpled, combative bossof Breit-bart, a hard-rightnewsoutlet).When brieﬁngagainstthe Kushnerfaction, the Bannon campusessuch slursas“the Democrats”, “the NewYorkers” or“the glo-balists”. MrKushnerand hiselegantlytailored friendsarecharged with beingsqueamish aboutimmigration, too eager tosee America playglobal policeman in Syria and peacemaker inthe Middle East, and willingto give a hearingto Democratic ex-pertson such subjectsashealth policyorclimate change.Bannonites, Democratsand punditshave mocked MrKushnerforthe range ofhisresponsibilities. The president’sson-in-lawischargedwithoverseeingeverythingfrom Middle Eastpeace to re-lationswith Canada, Mexico and China, and reorganising thefederal governmentusinglessonsfrom business. Butto castthese ﬁghtsasa clash between leftand right, orevenaspalace intrigues, isto missthe whole story. The semi-publiccombatbetween MrBannon and MrKushnerrestson an argu-mentaboutsomethingmuch larger: namely, the purpose of MrTrump’spresidencyitself.ForMrBannon, the pointofwinningthe 2016 election wastoadvance a cause, which historymayin time call Trumpism. Afor-mernaval oﬃcerfrom a blue-collarfamilyin Virginia, he spentyearsstudyingtheoriesofhowsocietiescollapse. He has madeseveral lurid, doomyﬁlmsallegingthatworkingfamilies havebeen sold outbyrootless, corruptelites, who stood by and proﬁt-ed asimmigrantsﬂooded in. Otherworkslamented the collapseofJudaeo-Christian valuesin the American heartland. Mr Ban-non sawbefore manyotherson the hard rightthatMrTrumpmightnotbe a conventional conservative, butstill “intuitively”grasped the powerofeconomicpopulism. On joiningthe govern-mentasthe president’sideologue-in-chief, MrBannon pastedspeciﬁcpromisesmade in Trump campaign speecheson thewallsofhisWestWingoﬃce. Those promisescovereverythingfrom bordersecurityto global trade and an assaulton regulationsand the federal agenciesthatwrite them, through whatMr Ban-non callsthe “deconstruction ofthe administrative state”. Ad-dressingconservativesin February, the strategistassured themthat, wheneverestablishmenttypestryto lure MrTrump awayfrom thatradical agenda, “He’slike: ‘No, I promised the Americanpeople this, and thisisthe plan we’re goingto execute on’.”Duringthe election MrBannon bonded with MrKushnerintheirshared contemptforprofessional campaign consultants. TohearMrKushnerdescribe it, the Trump campaign resembled adisruptive startup, full oftech whizzeswith “nontraditional”backgroundsoutside politics. AddressingNewYorkbusinessbossesin December, MrKushnerexplained howthe campaignexposed him to the angerofAmericanswho feel ignored by theirgovernment. He realised thathe lived in a “bubble” ofelite opin-ionsaboutsuch subjectsasimmigration orthe environment.“I like Steve, but...”However, MrKushnerdiﬀersin atleastone importantway fromMrBannon. He actsasifthe lastelection wasa victory fora mancalled Trump, nota movementcalled Trumpism. Shortlyafter theelection MrKushnertold Forbesmagazine thathisfather-in-lawtranscendspartylabels, with policiesoﬀering“a blend ofwhatworks, and eliminatingwhatdoesn’twork.”Both men entered the White House rootingforMrTrump toprove criticswrong. ButifMrTrump prospersbybreaking everycampaign promise, MrBannon’snationalistcause will havebeen betrayed. The strategisthassurvived until nowby tellingMrTrump he can help him keep those pledges, shoringup his mostloyal basesofsupport. Yetovertime, historysuggests thatseekingto bind MrTrump with hisown wordsisa losinggambit.The logicofMrKushner’sfamilyﬁrstpragmatism issimpler:Americanswill thankMrTrump ifhispoliciesimprove theirlives. Fornowboth men oﬀerthe presidentpossible paths to suc-cess. Atsome pointtheirvisionswill prove incompatible—hencerecentrumours, fuelled byMrTrump, thatMrBannon may besacked. The prize beingfoughtoveristhe president’slegacy. Thatisa contestnoteveryone can survive.7TrumpvTrumpismWhatthe feud between the president’s son-in-lawand his chiefideologue revealsLexingtonThe EconomistApril15th2017291INTHE earlyhoursofJune 28th 2009 aunitofthe Honduran armystormed thehouse ofthe president, Manuel Zelaya, dis-armed hisguard and spirited him onto aplane bound forCosta Rica. The armysenttanksonto the streets, silenced radio andtelevision stationsand cutoﬀelectricityand waterto partsofTegucigalpa, the capi-tal. Afake letterofresignation from MrZe-laya wasread outto Honduras’scongress,which approved hisousting. ItwasLatinAmerica’slastreal coup. Asa general election approachesin No-vember, those eventsare uppermostinHondurans’ minds. ThatispartlybecauseMrZelaya hasnotgone away; hiswife,Xiomara Castro, isa presidential candi-date. More important, the currentpresi-dent, Juan Orlando Hernández, isbreakingataboo which MrZelaya wasthrown outofoﬃce to protect: he isrunningfor re-elec-tion. That, plusMrHernández’sauthoritar-ian style, hasmade the main election issuethe fate ofdemocracyitself. The authorsofthe constitution, adopt-ed in 1982, wanted to preventwould-bestrongmen from entrenchingthemselvesin power. Unambiguously, the documentdeclaresthatanyone who hasexercised“executive power” maynotbe president.An oﬃce-holderwho merelyadvocateschangingthatprovision “shall immediate-ly” be dismissed. The white-hatted Mr Ze-laya, whose softspotforVenezuelan so-cialism terriﬁed the Honduran elite,failed state, he isalso reviled forstunting itsdevelopment. He governsa countrythatservesasa conduitformuch ofthe cocainethatentersthe United States, and wherepolice and politiciansare enmeshed withdrug-traﬃckinggangs. The son ofPorﬁrioLobo, MrHernández’spredecessor, haspleaded guiltyto cocaine traﬃcking. Morethan 60% ofHonduransare poor. In 2013,the yearbefore MrHernándeztookoﬃce,Honduraswasstill the mostmurderouscountryon earth. Itspublicﬁnanceswere amess: the budgetdeﬁcitwas7.9% ofGDP(see chart). Some 600,000 Hondurans,about7% ofthe population, have moved tothe United States. MrHernández, who wasschooled in amilitaryacademy, broughta thwackof au-thority. Athisinauguration ceremony hedramaticallydispatched the armyto takethe ﬁeld againstcriminals. “The partyhasended,” he declared. The murderrate hasfallen since the armytookup positions inthe country’smostviolentbarrios, helpedbycrime-prevention programmesﬁ-nanced bythe United States. MrHernán-dezhasdisrupted some drug-traﬃckingnetworksand shipped dozensofsuspect-ed druglordsto the United Statesfor trial,earningthe gratitude ofboth the Obamaand Trump administrations.He steadied the government’sﬁnancesbyraisingthe salestaxand cuttingthewage bill. The poorare spared, MrHernán-dez’salliesinsist. Manybeneﬁtfrom VidaMejor(BetterLife), a programme that pro-videsroofs, waterﬁltersand othergoodies.Teachershave been disciplined: school-children nowspend 225 daysa yearin theclassroom. With help from McKinsey, aconsultancy, the governmenthashatchedaplan to develop such industriesastou-rism, textilesand call centres. Thisrecord hasbred more suspicionthan goodwill. Thatispartlybecause Mrplanned to hold a non-bindingreferen-dum on whetherto convene a constituentassemblyto change the constitution. Manythoughthe would use itto hangon to pow-erindeﬁnitely. Thattriggered hisremoval. MrHernández, whose Machiavelliantalentswould impresseven the Florentinephilosopher, did nothingso clumsy. He isabeneﬁciaryofa suitbroughtbya formerpresident, Rafael Callejas, who argued thatthe term limitviolated hishuman rights. InApril 2015 the supreme courtruled in theex-president’sfavour, suspendingthe con-stitutional ban on re-election. MrCallejasisnotrunning, butMrHernándezis.He isa paradox.

The doubtsbegin with the president’ssignature policyofsendingthe armytoﬁghtcrime. Militaryunitsdetersome vio-lence, butaftera drop the murderrate hasstabilised ata high level. Mostpeople stillthinkinsecurityisthe biggestproblem. Thegovernmentplansto replace soldierswithareformed police force, butthatwill takeyears. In the meantime, MrHernándezisspreadingthe militarymindsetthrough hisadministration. He hasdeployed oﬃcersin all branchesofgovernmentto serve ashis“eyesand ears”, saysMrPineda. The judiciaryand the electoral commis-sion are subservientto the president, hesays. In a rankingofjudicial systems bytheWorld Justice Project, a pressure group,Hondurascomes92nd outof113 countrieson itsmeasure ofconstraintson govern-mentpowers. DuringMrLobo’spresiden-cythe social-securitysystem wasde-frauded of$300m; a small amountofmoneyfrom ﬁrmslinked to the scandalhelped ﬁnance MrHernández’scampaign(withouthisknowledge, he says). That rev-elation triggered weeklytorchlitprotestsand demandsforhisresignation in 2015. He soughtto lowerthe temperature byinvitingin an anti-corruption mission,MACCIH, underthe auspicesofthe Orga-nisation ofAmerican States. Ithasbig am-bitions: to help prosecutorsinvestigate cor-ruption, spura cleanup ofpartyﬁnancingand encourage judicial reform. Anewin-vestigation and prosecution unitspecialis-ingin corruption isto begin worknextmonth. MACCIHhelped win longjail sen-tencesforthe formerhead ofthe social-se-curityinstitute. “We neverhad such a sen-tence before forcorruption,” saysitsPeruvian chief, Juan Jiménez.Butthe group isencounteringasmuchresistance ascollaboration. Ithasclashedwith congressoverthe implementation ofthe party-ﬁnancinglawand with the presi-dentand congressoverthe namingofmagistratesto the government’sspendingwatchdog. MACCIHisbeingsubjected to a“blackcampaign”, saysMrJiménez. Nowthe trial ofMrLobo’sson in NewYorkthreatensto damage MrHernández’scrime-ﬁghtingimage. In March a court-room heard a formermemberofLosCa-chiros, a drug-traﬃckinggang, testify thathe had metMrHernández’sbrother, Tony.The purpose wasto persuade the govern-mentto payitsdebtto a companyused bythe gangto laundermoney.

In all, 141countrieshave gotridofthe death penaltyin laworin practice.Atleastten Asian countriesresorted tocapital punishmentlastyear, however.China isbelieved to be the mostfrequentexecutioner, though the numberofpeo-ple killed, and forwhich crimes, remaincloselyguarded secrets. The Philippineslookspoised to reintroduce capital pun-ishment—and in practice the police ad-ministeritfrequently, byshooting drugsuspectswithoutthe nicetyofa trial.Vietnam also shroudscapital punish-mentin secrecy. Foryearsitwasbelievedto execute justa fewpeople a year. Butareportfrom itsMinistryofPublicSecuri-ty, published in the local media in Febru-ary, said that429 prisonerswere executedbetween August8th 2013 and June 30th2016. Thatwould make Vietnam theworld’sthird-most-proliﬁcexecutioner,afterChina and Iran (see chart). Vietnam hasalso continued sentenc-ingpeople to death ata rapid clip—63 in2016 alone, accordingto Amnesty’scount, which itbelievesisincomplete.Mostofthese were fordrugoﬀences.Justtwo yearsago a diﬀerentcourseseemed likely. Vietnam abolished capitalpunishmentforseveral crimes, includingdrugpossession, producingortradingcounterfeitfood, and corruption—provid-ed the accused returned 75% ormore ofthe amountstolen.

Bulliesare rarelypunished: in 2014 there were188,057 reported casesand justtwo sus-pensions. The lawalso assumesthatcon-formityisthe wayto stop bullying.

Thismakesitmore likelythat thehardlinerswill again see theirvote split.Still, the anti-Iranian rhetoricof DonaldTrump, America’spresident, isa bigbonusforthe anti-reformists, should theycometogether. Aftera nucleardeal between Iranand sixmajorpowerswasconcluded in2015, MrRohani’sre-election had seemedassured. Butthe promised fruitsfrom theliftingofUN sanctions(in return forIrancurbingitsnuclearprogramme) have beenslowto arrive.

And ithasexpanded mo-bile coverage from 39% to 99% ofIran, in-cludingto 27,000 villageswhich thehardlinershitherto considered strong-holds. So MrRohani continuesto gethismessage out.

Bymanymeasures, itisthe continent’sbestcollege outside South Africa. Butitwasclosed fortwo monthsfrom NovemberbyUganda’sautocraticpresident, Yoweri Mu-seveni, aftera strike bylecturersover un-paid bonusessparked studentprotests.Founded bythe British to train local co-lonial administrators, Makerere hasa repu-tation foreducatingthe powerful. Tanza-nia’sfoundingpresident, JuliusNyerere,studied there. So did Kenya’sthird leader,Mwai Kibaki, and the DemocraticRepublicofCongo’scurrenthead ofstate, Joseph Ka-bila. The universitywentthrough a roughperiod between 1971and 1979, when itfeltcompelled to make Idi Amin, a barelyliter-ate despot, itschancellor. Amin awardedhimselfa doctorate oflaw, despite neitherstudyingmuch norbelievingin the rule oflaw. Butthose darkdaysare past. Maker-ere’sresearchersare nowsome ofAfrica’smostproliﬁc, creatingeverythingfromlow-costsanitarypadsto an electric car.Nonethelessthe institution’sproblems—too manystudentsand too little money—are all too common acrossthe continent. Makerere hasmore than doubled enrol-mentto nearly40,000 in the pasttwo de-cades. Asgovernmentscholarships, mostofthem allocated bymeritratherthanneed, have become scarcer, and strike-hap-pylecturershave demanded ever-higherwages(even though academicsatpublicuniversitiesare some ofUganda’sbest-paid workers), the universityhastried toclose the fundinggap byadmittingmorefee-payers. Butin real termsitspends al-mosta quarterlessnowthan in 2007, eventhough the numberofstudentshasrisenby12% overthe same period. Similarpressuresare feltacross sub-Sa-haranAfrica, especiallyin the poorercountries. (South Africa’suniversitysys-tem ismore advanced butfacesotherdiﬃ-culties, includingdemandsbymilitant stu-dentsthatfeesbe abolished altogether.) AWorld Bankstudyof23 poorerAfricanstatesfound thatenrolmentsatpublic andprivate universitieshad quadrupled be-tween 1991and 2006, while publicspend-ingon them rose byjust73%. Openingnewpublicinstitutionstomeetgrowingdemand hasnotbeen pro-blem-free, either. In 2000 Ethiopia had twopublicuniversities; by2015 ithad 29.“These are notuniversities, they’re shells,”saysPaul O’Keefe, a researcherwho has in-terviewed manyEthiopian academics,and heard storiesofovercrowded class-rooms, lecturerswho have nothingmorethan undergraduate degreesthemselvesand governmentspieson campus. In those countrieswhere highereduca-tion wasliberalised afterthe cold war, priv-ate universitiesand colleges, often reli-gious, have sprungup. Between 1990 and2007 theirnumbersoared from 24 to morethan 460 (the numberofpublicuniversi-tiesmeanwhile doubled to 200). Buttheyoften ﬁnd themselvestied up in red tape.GossyUkanwoke tried to establish Nige-ria’sﬁrstonline-onlyuniversityin 2012, butwasforced bythe governmentto acquire acampus.

Open-source software and web-sitessuch asSci-Hub thatmake pricey aca-demicjournalsfree to read (albeitillegallyin mostjurisdictions), also help cash-strapped universitiesimprove teachingand research. Buteven these welcomedevelopmentswill notgo farifAfrican uni-versitiescontinue to admitmore studentsthan theycan cope with. Africa needsmore well-educatedyoungpeople. Butmanyofitsyounggrad-uateshave gained little more from theirtime atuniversitythan raised expecta-tions.

Ber-trand’swife Geneviève, a retired librariancarryinggeraniumsfrom the market, votedforMrHollande lasttime. Butshe dismiss-esthe Socialistcandidate, BenoîtHamon,as“Utopian”.

He trails onlyafewpointsbehind MsLe Pen and Emman-uel Macron, a pro-European liberal whofounded hisEn Marche! partyjusta yearago. Ifthese pollsare right, candidatesfrom non-traditional partiesare setto cap-ture the top three places. Guillaume Kas-barian, the En Marche! representative forthe area around Châteaudun, saysthere isan edge forthe candidate who soundsthemostdégagiste—thatis, the mosteager tothrowthe bumsout.

If“infor-mation conﬂict” helpsRussia-friendlycan-didateswin elections, itwill be becauseEurope’sbitterpoliticsand anarchicmediaenvironmenthave prepared the ground. 7CHARGESofRussian interference inEuropean politicstend to be shroudedin mystery. Take the case ofEgorPutilov(pictured), also known asAlexanderFrid-back, TobiasLagerfeldtand Aleksandr Ya-rovenko. On June 8th 2016, SverigesRadio,the Swedish publicradio station, inter-viewed MrPutilov, who identiﬁed himselfasa formeremployee ofthe national mi-gration agency. He stated thatasylum-seek-ersasold as40 were claimingto be chil-dren, and thatthe agencywasletting themin. In a countrydivided overrefugee poli-cy, the allegation seemed explosive.Two hourslater, SverigesRadio deletedthe interview. MrPutilovwasan unreli-able source: he had taken a journalismcourse atthe broadcastersome monthsearlier, and had been reported to the policeforfailingto return histemporarypresscard. Then in August, Aftonbladet, a daily,reported thatsomeone callinghimselfEgorPutilovhad used the pen name TobiasLagerfeldtto write an opinion piece that ithad published, callingfora more open ref-ugee policy. Moreover, itfound, the so-called MrPutilovwasin factAlexanderFridback, an employee ofthe ultra-nationalistSweden Democratsparty.Thisiswhere thingsgetreallyconfus-ing. MrFridbackimmigrated to Swedenfrom Russia in 2007, apparentlyunderthename AleksandrYarovenko. In 2011hechanged hisfamilyname to Fridback, sup-posedlybecause Swedesfound Yarovenkohard to pronounce.

(Somethingsimilarmight beexpected in the lesslikelyeventofa victoryforJean-Luc Mélen-chon, a hard-leftcandidate makinga late surge.)The mechanism forleavingthe euro, saysLudovicde Danne,MsLe Pen’sEurope adviser, would be a referendum on exiting theEUaltogether. Butthatfacesconstitutional barriers, as MsLe Pencannotwin a majorityin legislative electionsin June. Moreover,the polarisingeﬀectofherelection maynotleave her much politi-cal wriggle-room. French votershave little appetite for a collapsein the value oftheirassets, orthe chaosofcapital controls à lagrecquethata promised “Frexit” would bring. With marketsroil-ing, French banksunderpressure and protestersﬁlling the streets,MsLe Pen mightpreferto parkthe issue. There are signs ofthisal-ready; herrhetoricon the euro hascooled in recentweeks. Tacklingmigration and securitymightlookmore tempting.Unlike Frexit, tighteningborders, limitingimmigration and crack-ingdown on foreign “posted” workersare popularpropositions.Lastyear71% ofFrench voterstold IFOP, a pollster, thatthey want-ed to scrap Schengen. Butthatwould create asmanyproblems asitsolves. Alain Lamassoure, a French formerEurope minister,notesthatthere are around 1,500 bordercrossingsbetweenFrance and Belgium alone; itisludicrousto expectthem all to bepoliced. Full withdrawal from Schengen mightalso mean losingaccessto EUpolice databases, which would be an odd wayfor MsLe Pen to provide the securityshe haspromised voters. She mighttherefore simplytighten existingcontrols, steppingup checksatairports, railwaystationsand land crossings. MsLePen would also targetforeign-owned ﬁrmsemployingcheapworkersfrom eastern Europe. (Rare isthe French politician whodeclinesto pickon Polish plumbersorRomanian labourers.) Tax-payer-funded positionswould, saysMrde Danne, be subject to“national preference”: ie, French jobsforFrench workers. MuchofthisbreachesEUrules, butso what? IfBrusselswantsto pickaﬁght, MsLe Pen would be delighted to oblige. MsLe Pen’sapproach to the EUmaybe to denude itofauthor-itybyendlesslyprobingitstolerance.

Ifitcracksdown, itfeedsMsLe Pen’snarrativethatBrusselsisthwartingthe sovereign will ofFrench voters. Germanywould be lefteven furtheradrift. The Franco-Ger-man alliance, asMrsMerkel remindsMsLe Pen in “La Prési-dente”, hasalwaysdriven the EUforwards. Butno German chan-cellorcould do businesswith MsLe Pen.

Butthe dingywire fence andmossyconcrete beneath itletdown the en-thusiasm ofthe sign’swelcome. Redditchisstruggling. In recentyears, wages havefallen. Ithasalso seen a rapid rise in thenumberofmigrants, in particularthosefrom eastern Europe. Perhapslinkingthesetwo phenomena, the people ofRedditchvoted 62:38 to leave the European Union inthe referendum lastJune.Immigration isa boon forBritain. The9m-odd foreign-born people livingtherebringwith them skillsand attitudesthatmake the countrymore productive. Youn-gerand bettereducated than natives, im-migrantspaymore in taxthan theyuseinthe wayofpublicservices. Forsome insti-tutionstheyare indispensable: perhaps30% ofdoctorsin Britain are non-British.Even so, Britain isunenthusiastic aboutimmigration. Surveysﬁnd thatroughlyhalfofpeople would like itreduced “a lot”and fewerthan 5% wantitto go up.Manypoliticiansinterpretthe vote forBrexit asaplea to reduce the numberofnewarrivals.Although the governmenthasrecentlyhinted thatnetmigration maynotfall bymuch afterBritain leavesthe EU, a groupcalled Leave MeansLeave, backed bytwo-dozen MPs, iscallingforitto be slashed to asixth ofitscurrentlevel.To understand thisantipathyto immi-gration, we examined the ten local authori-tiesthatsawthe largestproportional in-crease in foreign-born folkin the ten yearsfrom 2005 to 2015 (we excluded NorthernIreland, because ofdiﬀerencesin its data).Whereasbigcitiessuch asLondon havethe greatestshare ofimmigrantsamongtheirpopulations, the placesthathave ex-perienced the sharpestrisesare mostlysmallertowns, which until recentlyhadseen little immigration (see map).Top ofthe listisBoston, in Lincolnshire,where in 2005-15 the numberofforeign-born residentsrose from about1,000 to16,000. In 2005 immigrantswere aboutone in 50 ofthe local population. They arenowone in four. All ten areaswe looked atsawatleasta doublingin the share of thepopulation thatwasborn outside Britain.These ten areas—call them Migran-tland—voted about60:40 in favourofleav-ingthe EU, compared with 52:48 acrossBritain. Boston wentforBrexitby76:24, thehighestmargin ofanylocal authority. Andwhereasithasoften been noted thattherewasno linkbetween the size ofa place’smigrantpopulation and local enthusiasmforBrexit(considerLondon, both cosmo-politan and heavilyforRemain), we foundsome linkbetween the increase in thenumberofmigrantsand the likelihood tovote Leave (see chartoverleaf). Londonboroughssuch asHackneyand Newhamhave welcomed large numbersofforeign-ersforcenturies. People in those placeshave gotused to newcomers, suggestsTonyTraversofthe London School ofEco-nomics. “Butwhen yourlocal populationofmigrantsgoesfrom 10% to 15% in a de-cade, that’swhere yougetthe bite.”Jacqui Smith, a formerMP forRedditchand Labourhome secretaryin 2007-09,seeshispoint. “I knowthere’sracism inLondon, butpeople have largelybecomeused to diverse communities...The transi-tional impactin Redditch ismuch greater,”she says.

Butthose who lackhousingorworkworryaboutwhatsuch changesrepresent. Thestaﬀatan employmentagencyin Redditchattestto such fears. Mostofthe workerstheyplace in jobsare from eastern Europe.“They’re brilliant, we love them,” smilesone memberofstaﬀ. Butwhen localscomelookingforworkand see howmanyfor-eign namesare on the agency’sregister,there issome resentment, she says.The wrong place atthe wrong timeItistemptingto conclude thatsuch atti-tudesare motivated byprejudice. Yet acloserlookatthe economyand public ser-vicesin Migrantland makesclearthat itsresidentshave plentyto be angryabout—even ifthe migrantsare notthe culprits.Placeswhere livingischeap and jobsplentiful are attractive to newcomers. In2005 the average house in Migrantlandcostaround £140,000 (then $255,000),compared with more than £150,000 acrossBritain. Unemploymentwaslowerthanaverage. Low-skill jobsblossomed. Mi-grantland seemsto be more dependentonagriculture than the restofthe country. Thebigchange in Boston, saysPaul Gleeson, alocal Labourcouncillor, isthatpreviously-seasonal work, such asfruit- and veg-pick-ing, hasbecome permanentastechnologyand newcrop varietieshave lengthenedthe agricultural season. Thismeansthepeople doingthatworknowlive there per-manently, too. Manufacturingcentresarenearby: food processing, forinstance, isabigemployerin Boston and Mansﬁeld. Given the nature ofthe jobson oﬀer, itisunsurprisingthatthe newarrivalsare of-ten youngand notparticularlywell edu-cated orAnglophone. We estimate thatwhereasover40% ofthe PoleslivinginLondonhaveahigher-educationqualiﬁca-tion, onlyabouta quarterdo in the EastMidlands, where three ofourten areas are.One in 20 people in Boston cannotspeakEnglish well oratall, accordingto the 2011census. Small wonderthatintegration ishard. Manylandlordsdo notallowtenantsto drinkorsmoke inside, so people sit outon benches, havinga drinkand a cigarette.“Because they’re young, notbecausethey’re foreign, theymightnotputtheirtinsin the bin,” saysMrGleeson.What’smore, the placesthathave seenthe greatestsurgesin migration have be-come poorer. In 2005-15 real wagesin Mi-grantland fell bya tenth, much faster thanthe decline in the restofBritain. On an “in-dexofmultiple deprivation”, a govern-mentmeasure thattakesinto accountfac-torssuch asincome, health and education,the area appearsto have become relativelypooreroverthe pastdecade.Are the newcomersto blame? Immigra-tion mayhave heightened competition forsome jobs, pushingpaydown. Butthe ef-fectissmall. AHouse ofLordsreport in2008 suggested thatevery1% increase inthe ratio ofimmigrantsto nativesin theworking-age population leadsto a 0.5% fallin wagesforthe lowest10% ofearners(andasimilarrise forthe top 10%). Since Migran-tland relieson low-paid work, itprobablysuﬀered more than most. Butmore powerful factorsare atplay.Because the area isdisproportionately de-pendenton manufacturing, ithassuﬀeredfrom the industry’sdecline. And since 2010Conservative-led governmentshaveslashed the numberofcivil servants, in abid to rightthe publicﬁnances. The axe hasfallen hard on the administrative jobs thatare prevalentin unglamorouspartsof thecountry. Migrantland’spublic-sectorjobshave disappeared 50% fasterthan those inBritain asa whole. In the ForestofDeantheyhave dropped byovera third. Mean-while, cutsto working-age beneﬁtshavesucked awayspendingpower.Even before austerity, ithad long beenthe case thatpoorplaceshad the mostthreadbare publicservices. Medical staﬀ,forinstance, preferto live in prosperous ar-eas. OuranalysissuggeststhatMigran-tland isrelativelydeprived ofgeneral prac-titioners. Doctorsforthe EastMidlands aretrained in Nottingham and Leicester, butfewerpeople wantto studythere than inLondon, forinstance. Aftertrainingthere,halfgo elsewhere. In 2014 there were 12placesfortrainee doctorsin Boston; onlyfourwere ﬁlled. Followthe moneyWhatcan be done? In placeswhere publicspendinghasnotyetcaughtup with a rap-idlyenlarged population, the governmentcould targetextra fundingin the short term.The previousLabourgovernmentran a“migration impactsfund”, introduced byMsSmith. She acknowledgesthattheamountsinvolved were small (the budgetwasjust£35m peryear) butarguesthat thepointwasto reassure people thatthe gov-ernmentunderstood fearsthatimmigra-tion can make thingstough fora time. Thecurrentgovernmenthaslaunched a simi-larinitiative, though itisno better funded.And although Britonsdislike immigra-tion, theydo notfeel the same resentmenttowardsimmigrantsthemselves. Oncetheyhave been placed in jobsalongsideeach other, localsand migrantstend to rubalong, saysthe Redditch recruitmentagen-cy. Amusicfestival wasrecentlyheld in thetown to raise moneyforchildren’shospitalwardsin Poland. Local Polestookpart inthe Holocaustcommemoration thisyear,saysBill Hartnett, leaderofthe council.All thatmaybe encouraging, butit doesnotprovide a wayto improve conditionsin the left-behind placesto which migrantshave rushed. To manypeople, Brexitmayappearto be justsuch a policy.

The Kremlin branded himAmerica’spoodle forcancellinga trip to Russia atthe lastminute,supposedlyunderordersfrom America’ssecretaryofstate, RexTillerson. MrJohnson struckbackbybrieﬁngthe British pressthat, on the contrary, he wasa deciderand a doer, who, having“spoken to all the powerplayers”, wasdemandingthatWesternnationsdrawup “verypunitive sanctions” againstthe Syrian re-gime and itsenablers. He then presented hisplansforsanctionsatthe G7 meetingin Lucca, Italy, onlyto be given the cold shoul-der. The ﬁnal G7 communiqué didn’tmention sanctionsatall. MrJohnson wasrightto cancel histrip to Russia, which wouldhave been the ﬁrstbya British foreign secretaryforﬁve years. It isimportantthatthe Westspeakto Russia with one voice after thechemical attackin Syria, and thatvoice needsto be America’s. Buthe waswrongto reactto a childish gibe byboastingabout plansforsanctionswithoutﬁrstclearingthem with hisG7 counter-parts. Hishalf-cocked diplomacyleftBritain humiliated and theG7 divided. The problem with the foreign secretaryisnot thatheisa poodle: poodlestend to be dependable and loyal. The pro-blem isthathe’sa disorganised narcissist. MrJohnson wasan odd choice forBritain’schiefdiplomat. Hemade hiscareerasa journalistentertainingDailyTelegraphread-erswith storiesabouthorrible foreigners, particularly “Brusselsbureaucrats” and theiralleged obsession with the curvature ofbananas. He wasputinto hiscurrentjob because he can exerciseinﬂuence in England’sToryheartlands, notthe world’schancel-leries. MrJohnson’sreal job isto sell the eventual Brexit settle-mentto ToryMPsand theirfootsoldiersin the shires. Yetthe foreign secretaryisin some waysan embodiment ofwhatiswrongwith Britain’sforeign policy: shambolic, distractedand driven bydomesticconsiderations. The Foreign and Com-monwealth Oﬃce isa shadowofitsformerglorywhen it admin-istered a quarterofthe world’spopulation from itsmagniﬁcentpalacenextto DowningStreet.

The Trea-suryhasground itsnext-doorneighbourbya twin process ofstarvingitoffundsand stealingsome ofitsplum jobs. Britain’spreviousambassadorto the EU, SirIvan Rogers, wasa Treasuryman who had neverworked forthe Foreign Oﬃce. The Depart-mentforInternational Development(DfID), which wascreatedonlyin 1997, hasgrown into a monsterthatovershadowsits aris-tocraticstepbrother. DfIDisrollingin moneybecause a legallymandated formula allocatesit0.7% ofnational income; mean-while the Foreign Oﬃce mustdownsize orsell oﬀitsembassies.

Prime minis-terstend to see foreign policythrough the prism ofdomestic poli-cy: David Cameron sawitthrough the prism ofriddingthe Toriesoftheirimage asa “nastyparty”; Theresa Mayseesitthrough theprism ofthe Home Oﬃce and the problem ofcontrolling migra-tion.

Fordecadesitsstrategyhasconsisted ofacting asabridge between Europe and the United Stateswhile cultivating itsglobal connectionsasa formerimperial power. Butlast June 52%ofBritish votersdecided to blowup halfthe bridge, rendering thewhole ediﬁce ratherpointless.

In the longerterm itinvolvesrethinking Britain’sinternational role and reinforcingitsrelationsacross the world.Thatrequiresa revitalised and self-conﬁdentForeign Oﬃce.There are a fewsignsofa revival.

Spec-ulation centred atﬁrston a possible mega-mergerbetween GMand FiatChryslerAutomobiles(FCA), itselfthe resultof adeal in 2014 (FCA’schairman, John Elkann,sitson the board ofThe Economist’sparentcompany). The Italian-owned ﬁrm, whichmakesjustunder5m vehiclesa year, is runbySergio Marchionne, who hasbeen eye-inga mergerwith GMforyears. With theVolkswagen. The German ﬁrm haslongcasta covetouseye overbitsofFCA. Atanannual industryshindigin Geneva inMarch thatcoincided with the ﬁnal sale ofOpel, MrMarchionne said he had “nodoubtthatatthe relevanttime Volkswagenmayshowup and have a chat”. He alsosuggested thatPSAGroup’sacquisition ofthe GMunit, which putsthe French ﬁrm insecond place in Europe, addsto the pres-sure on VW, the marketleader,to bulkupfurther. VW’scampaign to conquerAmeri-ca, where itsdiesel-emissionsscandal hasundermined itsweakposition, would bestrengthened with FCA in tow. FCA’sRamtrucksare hugelyproﬁtable in Americaand the Jeep brand isresurgentworldwide.The unrealised potential ofMaserati andAlfa Romeo, alluringbywordsforItalianstyle, isalso attractive.Adeal would, however, bringlittle ben-eﬁtin Europe, where VW alreadyhasa bigslice ofthe marketand plentyofsmall carson oﬀer. With Seat, a Spanish division,strugglingand itsownbrand said to beloss-makingin the region, VW could welldo withoutthe trouble ofintegrating Fiat.FCA isalso the onlybigcarcompanythat islumbered with lotsofdebt(ofjustunder€5bn), makingita lesstemptingtarget.MatthiasMüller, VW’schiefexecutive,hasnotruled outtalkswith FCA, and hasindicated thatthe German group ismoreopen to a mergerthan itused to be. But FCAisnotthe onlyoption. An acquisition ofFord (which justsuﬀered the humiliationofbeingovertaken in marketcapitalisationbyTesla, an electric-carﬁrm founded in2003) mightalso ﬁtVW’splans. Still, if VWisintenton leadingthe nextround of in-dustryconsolidation, itwill need to put“dieselgate” behind it. Though the Germanﬁrm haspaid $22bn in ﬁnesand compen-sation, the issue ofwho knewwhatandwhen isstill unresolved. American ﬁrm nowdiscardinga loss-mak-ingEuropean business, the theorygoes, itcould replace itwith a proﬁtable one—Fiat—and crunch togetherthe two ﬁrms’successful operationsin America.MaryBarra, GM’sboss, hasrepeatedlyrejected MrMarchionne’sovertures; sell-ingOpel isunlikelyto have changed hermind. Some observersunkindlysuggestthatGM isin anycase unable to handlethree tasksatonce, and thatitsaim in rid-dingitselfofOpel wasto concentrate onimprovingitsoperationsin America and inChina.

TheRenault-Nissan alliance hassucceeded.Aftertakinga controllingstake in Mitsub-ishi, a smallerJapanese carmaker, last year,the ﬁrm makesnearly10m carsa year.

Ifcarmega-mergersare to go ahead,however, and stand a betterchance of suc-cessthan pastattempts, two conditions ap-ply. First, the bigstakeholders—govern-ments, familiesand unions—will need tobe convinced. Manycarmakers, such asBMW, Fiat, Ford, Toyota, VW and others,have tiesto families, which in some caseshave blockingshareholdings. VW’sunionsorFrance’sgovernment, which hasstakesin Renaultand PSA,would oppose dealsthatcould resultin bigdomesticjob losses.Second, transactionswill need to domore than simplychase volume.

Butin a courthearingon April7th, America’sDepartmentofLabour(DoL) accused the companybehind theproﬁtable search engine ofburyingthe factthatitpaysitsfemale employeesless thantheirmale counterparts. The accusation oflowercompensation forwomen formspartofa lawsuitbythe DoL, which hasasked Google to turn overdetailed infor-mation on pay. The departmenthasnot re-leased data to backitsassertion, and Goo-gle deniesthe allegation. Whateverthe outcome in court, thegovernment’srecriminationsriskmarringGoogle’simage. Justthree daysearlier ithad taken to Twitterto boastthatit had“closed the genderpaygap globally”. Thatclaim isnowundersuspicion. Itistrue thatatGoogle’sparentcompany, Alphabet,several women hold high positions, in-cludingRuth Porat, the chiefﬁnancial oﬃ-cer, and Susan Wojcicki, who runsYou-Tube, an online-video business. Buttheimportantquestion isnotonlywhether afewwomen getpromoted butalso howthose in the middle and lowerranksfare. Whatﬁguresthere are painta depress-ingpicture aboutthe statusofwomen intechnology. Accordingto a one-oﬀsurveyin 2015 called “Elephantin the Valley”, two-thirdsofwomen in Silicon Valleyfeel ex-cluded from keynetworkingevents, andthree-ﬁfthshave experienced unwantedsexual advances. More than a quarterofAmerican women in engineering, technol-ogyand science feel “stalled” in theirca-reers, and a third saytheyare likely to quittheirjobswithin a year, accordingto theCentre forTalentInnovation, a think-tank. The marginalisation ofwomen in techbecame a prominentsubjectin 2015 duringasex-discrimination lawsuitbroughtby El-len Pao, who had worked ata venture-capi-tal ﬁrm, KleinerPerkins(she lostthe case).Ithasbeen backin the headlinessince Su-san Fowler, a formerengineeratUber, aride-hailingﬁrm, wrote a blogpostin Feb-ruarysayingthatmale supervisorshadfailed to promote women and thathumanresourceshad nottaken complaintsof sex-ism and harassmentseriously. Uberhashired EricHolder, America’sformerattor-ney-general, to lead an investigation intothe company’shandlingofsexual harass-mentand workplace culture. The resultsare expected in the comingweeks. Some ﬁrms, includingUber, are nowpublishingannual reportsdescribingthecomposition oftheirworkforce, after theywere criticised fornothiringmore womenand ethnicminorities. Well underhalf oftech companies’ employeesare female(see chart). Despite attemptsto hire morewomen, theyhave notshifted theirfe-male-staﬀsharesbymore than a fewper-centage points. Educational choicesare partofthe pro-blem. In 2013, the mostrecentyearforwhich data are available, onlyaround 18%ofcomputer-science graduateswere wom-en, halfthe proportion in 1985. Some sus-pectthere isa “negative” networkeﬀect,and thatthe small share ofwomen in theﬁeld discouragesothersfrom choosing itasacourse ofstudy. Retention isalso diﬃcult. Astudy in2014 thattracked women in jobsrelated toscience, technology, engineeringandmathematics(STEM) found thathalfofwomen had lefttheirprofessionsafter 12years. Bycomparison, onlya ﬁfth of wom-en who workin non-STEMﬁeldsleavewithin 30 years. Female entrepreneursﬁnd itmore diﬃcultto secure funding fromventure capitaliststhan theirmale counter-partsdo.

Such “cloudiﬁcation”, asitisknown, will probablycreate asmuch up-heaval in the telecomsindustryasithasdone in information technology(IT).ITand telecomsdiﬀerin important re-spects. One islargelyunregulated, the oth-eroverseen closelybygovernment. Com-putingcapacityistheoreticallyunlimited,unlike radio spectrum, which ishard to useeﬃciently. And telecomsnetworksaremore deeplylinked to the physical world.“Youcannotturn radio towersinto soft-ware,” saysBengtNordstrom ofNorth-stream, a consultancy.The data centresofbigcloud-comput-ingprovidersare packed with thousandsofcheap servers, powered bystandardprocessors. Telecomsnetworks, bycon-trast, are a collection ofhundredsof diﬀer-enttypesofcomputerswith specialisedchips, each in charge ofa diﬀerentfunc-tion, from textmessagingto controlling an-tennae. Ittakesmonths, ifnotyears, to setup a newservice, letalone a newnetwork.Butpowerful forcesare pushingforchange. On the technical side, the currentwayofbuildingnetworkswill hita wall astraﬃccontinuesto growrapidly. The nextgeneration ofwirelesstechnologies, called5G, requiresmore ﬂexible networks. Yetthe mostimportantfactorbehind cloudiﬁ-cation iseconomic, saysStéphane Téral ofIHSMarkit, a market-research ﬁrm. Mobileoperatorsbadlyneed to cutcosts, as thesmartphone boom endsin manyplacesand pricesofmobile-service plansfall. Theshiftwasevidentatthe Mobile World Con-gressin Barcelona in February.

Theyturn specialisedtelecomsgearinto software in a processcalled “virtualisation”.Manynetworkshave alreadybeen vir-tualised attheir“core”, the central high-ca-pacitygear. Butthisisalso starting to hap-pen atthe edgesofnetworks—theantennae ofa mobile network. These usu-allyplugdirectlyinto nearbycomputersthatcontrol the radio signal. Butsome op-erators, such asSKTelecom in South Korea,have begun consolidatingthese “base-band units” in a central data centre.

And there will al-waysbe a need forspecialised hardware,such asprocessorsable to handle datapacketsateverfasterspeeds. Still, Nokiaand othertelecoms-gear-makerswill haveto adapt.

Until recently,conveninga conference supportingantitrustconcernsin theWindyCitywaslike holdinga symposium on sobrietyin NewOrleans. In the 1970seconomistsfrom the “Chicago school” ar-gued thatbigﬁrmswere nota threatto growth and prosperity.Theirviewswentmainstream, which led courtsand regulators toadopta relaxed attitude towardsantitrustlawsfordecades. Butthe mood ischanging. There isan emergingconsensusamongeconomiststhatcompetition in the economyhasweak-ened signiﬁcantly. Thatisbad news: itmeansthatincumbentﬁrmsmaynotneed to innovate asmuch, and thatinequality mayincrease ifcompaniescan hoard proﬁtsand spend lesson invest-mentand wages. Itmayyetbe premature to talkabouta newChi-cago school, butinvestorsand bossesshould payattention to theintellectual shift, which maychange American business.The fearthatbigﬁrmsmightcome to dominate the economyand political life hasitsrootsin the era ofthe robber baronsofthe19th century. In 1911the governmentbroke up Standard Oil; untilthe 1960sregulatorspoliced mergerswith a bigstick. But bythe1970sthe economywassputtering, and America Incwaslosingground to Japanese and European industry. Free-marketscholarsatthe Chicago school argued thatthe pendulum had swung toofartowardsthe state and antitrustaction.Theyfeltthatregulatorswere interveningarbitrarily. RichardPosner, an academicwho laterbecame a judge, damningly wrotethattheyrelied on “eclecticforaysinto sociology”, nothard anal-ysis. Firmswere beingprevented from gettingbigenough tocreate economiesofscale thatcould beneﬁtconsumers, arguedbackersoffree markets. Well-run companiesthatnaturallygained marketshare were beingpenalised forsuccess.Overtime the Chicago school’sideasbecame so inﬂuentialthatthe courtsand the two antitrustregulators, the DepartmentofJustice (DoJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), adoptedafarmore favourable approach to bigbusiness. TodayMr Posner,who is78, jokesthathe became a judge in 1981expectingto spe-cialise in monopolycases, butregulatorsstopped bringing themto court. He remainsa true believerin the laissez-faire approach.ButatChicago(and elsewhere) a youngergeneration ofscholars,includingLuigi Zingalesand Raghuram Rajan, are worried thatcompetition isnotasvigorousasitused to be. Whathaschanged? The facts. The pendulum hasswungheavilyin favourofincumbentbusinesses. Theirproﬁts are ab-normallyhigh relative to GDP. Those thatmake a high return oncapital can sustain theirreturnsforlonger, suggesting thatlesscre-ative destruction istakingplace. The numberofnew, tiny ﬁrmsbeingborn isatitslowestlevel since the 1970s. Two explanationsare plausible. One issuccessive waves ofmergers. When yousplitthe economyinto its900 orso diﬀerentindustries, two-thirdshave become more concentrated since the1990s. Regulatorsmayalso have been captured byincumbentﬁrms, which getcosytreatment. American companiescollective-lyspend $3bn a yearon lobbying. In regulated industriesthatdon’tface competition from imports—health care, airlines andtelecommunications—pricesare atleast50% higherthan in otherrich countries, and returnson capital are high.The technologyindustry’sexpansion could exacerbate theproblem. An analysisbyThe Economistin 2016 suggested thatabouthalfthe pool ofabnormallyhigh proﬁtsisbeing earned bytech ﬁrms. The bigﬁve platform companies—Alphabet, Amazon,Apple, Facebookand Microsoft—earned $93bn lastyearand havehigh marketshares, forinstance in search and advertising. Theyare innovative butsometimesbehave badly. Theyhave bought519 ﬁrms, often embryonicrivals, in the pastdecade, and maysti-ﬂe them. The data theygathercan lockcustomersinto their pro-ducts. Theymayalso allowﬁrmsto exerttheirmarketpower“vertically” up and down the supplychain—thinkofAmazon us-inginformation on whatconsumersbuyto dominate the logis-ticsbusiness. Investors’ sky-high valuationsforthe platformﬁrmssuggesttheywill, in aggregate, roughlytriple in size.Ifthe summitshowed thatthere isa consensusthatcompeti-tion hasweakened, there waslittle agreementon howto re-spond. Pessimistsabound. Manyantitrusttechnocratsplead thattheyhave little power: bodieslike the DoJand the FTCare notmeantto run the economy, butinstead to enforce a body oflawthrough courtsthathave become friendlierto incumbents. Someradicalsargue thatthe governmentisnowso rotten that Americaiscondemned to perpetual oligarchyand inequality. Politicalsupportformore competition isworryinglyhard to ﬁnd. DonaldTrump hasa cabinetoftycoonsand likesto be chummywithbosses. The Republicanshave become the partyofincumbentﬁrms, notoffree marketsorconsumers. Too manyDemocrats,meanwhile, don’ttrustmarketsand wantthe state to smotherthem in red tape, which hurtsnewentrants.Lessons from the old schoolWhatisneeded isa three-pronged approach. Acampaign todrum up publicbackingforcompetition mightprod politicians toact: itwaspopularangeraboutmonopoliesin the 1890sthatledto crucial reformsin the early20th century. The technocratshavemore powerthan theyadmit. Antitrustlaws, such asthe Sher-man Actof1890, give plentyoflatitude. Theymustbe braver. Last-ly, scholarsshould learn from the ﬁrstChicago school. Itsleadinglightsdid notseekquickvictories, butwon the battle ofideasoveryears, theirviewspercolatinginto politics, the courts and publicopinion. America mustrediscoverthe virtuesofcompetition.With luck, in a couple ofdecades, itwill seem embarrassing thatanyone had to hold a conference to debate itsrelevance.7CronycapitalismBrightminds in Chicago worryaboutthe state ofcompetition in AmericaSchumpeter60The EconomistApril15th2017Fordailyanalysisanddebateoneconomics,visitEconomist.com/economics1GUO SHUQING, China’snewbankingregulator, knowsthe enormityofhistask. China’sbankingsystem, he observedlastmonth, isworth more than $33trn. So itisbiggerthan anyothercountry’s, andeven than Europe’sasa whole. And he iswell aware ofthe pitfallsleftbya decade ofbreaknecklendinggrowth. ButifMrGuo isnervous, he ishidingit. “All problemsandcontradictionswill be resolved,” he says.Ofcourse, a Chinese oﬃcial can be ex-pected to expressconﬁdence aboutChi-nese banks. More surprisingisthata smallbutgrowingnumberofanalystsand inves-torsseem to concur. Chinese banksharesare up bya quartersince earlylastyear.One investmentbank, Morgan Stanley, hasdeclared thatChina’slendersare “in asweetspot”. Another, Goldman Sachs, hasupgraded China to “overweight”—thatis,recommendingthatclientsbuyChineseshares—and isespeciallypositive aboutthe banks. Shanghai Financial News, a localnewspaper, described the newmoodaround these giantinstitutionsasthe “re-turn ofthe king”. The question iswhetheritwill be a long, stable reign ora short-lived, turbulentone.The clearestpositive forChina’sbankshasbeen an upturn in nominal economicgrowth. Real GDPgrowth (ie, accountingforinﬂation) islikelyto be little changed in2017 from lastyear’s6.7%. Butnominalgrowth isnearly10% in yuan terms, upsellingsome to investors. With more creditgoingto infrastructure projectsand tomortgages, which traditionallyhave beensafe in China, loan portfoliosare lookinghealthier. Richard XuofMorgan Stanleyreckonsthathigh-riskcreditwill declinefrom about6% oftotal creditin China to-dayto lessthan 3% by2020.There are also signsthatChina’sbloat-ed state-owned banksare gettinga littlemore eﬃcientastheyrespond to competi-tion from ﬁntech companies. The four big-gestbanks, which accountfornearlytwo-ﬁfthsofthe industry’sassets, cutemploy-eesin 2016 forthe ﬁrsttime in sixyears.Bankshave been rollingoutmobile apps tohandle paymentand investmenttransac-tionsthatused to be conducted in person.Overall costsoflisted banksrose by just0.6% lastyear, even asassetsgrewby 12%.All these good omens, however, maynotmean China’sbankshave reallyturnedthe corner. The beautiﬁcation oftheirbookshasrelied on ﬁnancial engineering.Overthe pastthree yearsthe governmenthasapproved the creation of35 asset-man-agementcompanies(ie, “bad banks”). Ja-son Bedford ofUBS, a Swissbank, saysthatthese companies, which buydelinquentloansfrom banks, often also ﬁnance them-selvesthrough bankloans.Debt-for-equityswapsare anotherform ofﬁnancial engineering: instead ofrepayingloans, indebted companiescanissue sharesto third parties, which acquirethe loansfrom banks. Yetthe ﬁne printshowsthattheirequityfunctionslikebonds: the companiesmustpaydividendsand buybacksharesiftheymissrevenuetargets. Moreover, the partiesholding theequityare funded in partbyinvestmentproductssold oﬀ-balance-sheetbybanks.The upshotisthat, whetherstashed in badbanksorconverted into equity, the debt markedlyoverthe past12 months. Higherpriceshave led to strongercorporate rev-enues, particularlyforindebted steel-pro-ducersand coalminers. This, in turn, hasmade iteasierforthem to repayloans. Chi-nese banks’ oﬃcial bad-debtratio, climb-ingsince 2012, held steadylastyearatabout1.7%. Manyanalystsstill thinkthereal level oftoxicloansismanytimes that(some estimate the ratio isashigh as 19%),butthe bleedinghasclearlyslowed.Meanwhile, bankshave started to cleanup theirbalance-sheets. In part, this hasbeen through more write-oﬀsofproblemloans.

Itisalayerofthe ocean, a fewhundred me-tresbelowthe surface, where little lightpenetrates, so algae do notlive. But itishome to animalsin abundance. There arebristlemouths: ﬁnger-sized ﬁsh with gap-ingmawsthatsportarraysofneedle-liketeeth. Theynumberin the quadrillions,and maybe the mostnumerousverte-brateson Earth. There are appendicular-ians: free-swimmingrelativesofsea-squirtsa fewmillimetresacross.

There are even squidand swordﬁsh—creaturesatleastfamiliarfrom the ﬁshmonger’sslab.And soon there will be nets. Having pil-laged shallowerwaters, the world’sﬁshingpowersare lookingto the mesopelagic asanewfrontier. The UN’sFood and Agricul-ture Organisation reported in 2002 thattheﬁsh-meal and ﬁsh-oil industrieswouldneed to exploitthispartofthe ocean in or-derto feed ﬁsh farms. In the pastninemonthsNorwayhasissued 46 newli-cencesforvesselsto ﬁsh there. In Septem-berthe governmentofSindh, a provincethatishome to mostofPakistan’sﬁshingﬂeet, issued a draftpolicyon licensing me-sopelagicﬁshingin itswaters. And at theNorth AtlanticSeafood Forum, held inthe carbon pump. The nocturnal feastingconsumesprodigiousamountsofthatcli-mate-changingelementin the form ofsmall, planktoniccreatures. Then, duringthe day, the feastersrelease partof whattheyhave consumed asfaeces. Some ofthem also die. These faecesand bodies fallthrough the watercolumn aswhatisknown asmarine snow, and accumulate atthe bottom. Withoutmesopelagicpreda-tors, farmore plankton would die in thesurface waters, theirbodilycarbon re-turned rapidlyto the atmosphere. The vastharmlessreservoirofcarbon in the depthswould thusbe a little smaller; the damag-ingburden ofatmosphericcarbon a goodbitgreater.Until now, the onlysensible waytoprobe mesopelagicactivityhasbeen by so-nar. Thisis, indeed, howthe zone was dis-covered, in 1942, byan American anti-sub-marine research project. From theirearliestdayssuch soundingssuggested a lotofcreatureslive in the mesopelagic.

Butsonarcan see onlyso much. WHOI’sgoal istostudythe zone usingrobots, which the in-March, in Bergen, Norway’sprincipal port,the session aboutﬁshingthe mesopelagicwasentitled “the BigApple”. On the face ofthings, bitingthat appleseemsa good idea. The mesopelagicishome to 10bn tonnesofanimals. Croppingamere 1% ofthiseach yearwould doublethe landed catch ofthe ocean’sﬁsheries.Mostofthiscatch would probablynot ap-peal to human palates. Butﬁsh farmersand meal merchantswould lap itup. The mesopelagicalso, however, acts asacarbon pump. Everyyearitpullsbe-tween 5bn and 12bn tonnesofthatelementoutofthe surface watersand into thedepths, where there isa vastreservoir ofthe stuﬀ.

Clearlanesthrough the Arcticocean would per-mitcommercial and naval shippingto tra-vel quicklybetween the Atlanticand thePaciﬁc. These lanesmightalso assist thesearch foroil and gas. The Russian authoritiesseem particu-larlykeen on the idea. Lastyeartheylaunched Arktika, the ﬁrstofthree giant,newnuclear-powered icebreakersintend-ed to help open such routes. Butsome peo-ple thinkthisapproach—bludgeoningthrough the ice with whatis, in essence, anarmour-plated knife—isold-fashioned.Theybelieve the job could be done fasterand more elegantlyusinga piece ofphysicscalled ﬂexural gravity-wave resonance. Iftheyare right, the icebreakersoftomorrowmightbe submarines.Resonance icebreakingwasdiscoveredin 1974 byCanada’scoastguard, when itbegan usingicebreakinghovercraftable tooperate in waterstoo shallowforconven-tional icebreakers. Atlowspeeds, thesecraftworkmuch asicebreakingshipsdo,byforcingsectionsofpack-ice in front oftheirbowsto rise up and detach them-selvesfrom the main sheet. When travel-lingabove 20kph, though, theycause oscil-lations, known asﬂexural gravitywaves,in the ice sheettheyhave passed over. Atthe correctspeed ofpassage these waveshita resonantfrequency—increasinginamplitude asthe critical speed ismain-tained until, atan amplitude dependent onthe thicknessofthe sheet, thatsheet willcrackup and disintegrate, leavinga naviga-ble passage behind.Forthingslike freeingrivermouths ofice, thisapproach can workwell. But hover-craftskirtsare easilydamaged byridged ice(the sortthatformswhen previouslybro-ken ice refreezes), so the vehiclescannot beused in placesthatrequire frequentclear-ance. Also, resonance-breakingbyhover-craftdoesnotworkforice sheetsmore thanabouta metre thick.Thatlimitis, however, no constraint onthe thinkingofresearchersled byViktorKozin ofthe Komsomolsk-on-AmurStateTechnical University, in Russia. DrKozinand histeam have been investigatingreso-nance icebreakingsince the 1990s. But, in-stead ofhovercraft, theyuse submarines.DrKozin’soriginal research wasonwaysto permitnaval submarinesto sur-face safelyand quicklythrough ice, the pre-viousmethod havingbeen simplyto riseuntil contactwasmade with the ice sheetand then increase buoyancyuntil the icecracked (asan American vessel ispictureddoingabove). That, though, isslowand candamage the boat. DrKozin found thatthebowwave from a submarine travellingclose to the surface pushesthe ice sheet up-wards, makingﬂexural gravitywavesin it,which cause itto breakup. Follow-up studiesbyDrKozin and hispupil, VitaliyZemlyak, who isnowat theSholem-Aleichem PriamurskyState Uni-versityin Birobidzhan, indicate that a sub-marine travelling30 metresbelowthe icecan breaka sheetone metre thick.

And thisiswhat So-phie Leclercq ofMcMasterUniversity, inHamilton, Ontario, hasnowdone.DrLeclercq and hercolleagues, whohave justpublished theirresultsin NatureCommunications, laced the drinkingwaterofsome pregnantfemale mice with medi-callyappropriate levelsofpenicillin, start-inga weekbefore those femaleswere dueto give birth, and carryingon three weeksafterbirth, to the pointwhere their oﬀ-springwere weaned (penicillin isknownto be transferred from motherto pup inmilk). One group ofmothers-to-be hadonlythe antibioticadded to theirwater. Asecond had a bacterium called Lactobacil-lusrhamnosus, a so-called probioticthat GutmicrobesandthebrainBadmedicineDosing pregnantmice with penicillinchanges theiroﬀsprings’ behaviourThe EconomistApril15th2017 Scienceandtechnology692hasbeen demonstrated experimentallytobe good forthe intestinal health ofmice,added aswell. Athird group ofexpectantmotherswere given theirdrinkingwaterunadulterated. Twenty-ﬁve pupswereborn to mothersin the ﬁrstgroup, 19 to thesecond and 28 to the third.Sixweekspostpartum, the researcherstested the sociabilityofthe various oﬀ-springbyputtingthem, one ata time, forten minutes, into a small, Y-shaped tunnelwith two chambersatthe ends. One cham-bercontained anothermouse, ofthe samesexasthe experimental animal, held in asmall wire cage. The second contained anemptycage. The team found that, when releasedinto thisapparatus, the oﬀspringof moth-ersexposed onlyto penicillin preferred tobe alone. Theyspentmore time in the emp-tychamber(fourand a halfminutes, on av-erage) than in the chambercontaining an-othermouse (three and three-quarterminutes). Those born ofmothersexposedneitherto penicillin norto Lactobacillusshowed the reverse pattern, averagingonlythree and a halfminutesin the emptychamberand almostﬁve in the chamberthatgave them company. Those mice bornofmothersgiven both penicillin and Lacto-bacillusfell between these extremes, aver-aginga bitunderfourand a halfminutes inthe chamberthatgave them company, andthree and three-quartersin the empty one.In all casesthere wasno signiﬁcant diﬀer-ence between the sexes.DrLeclercq gotsimilarresultswhen shetested the preferencesofhermice for socialnovelty. She did thisbylettingthemchoose, in the tunnel, between a newmouse and the one theyhad alreadymet.She found those exposed to penicillinalone lessinterested in the newmousethan those exposed to both penicillin andLactobacillus, orto neither. She also found thatexposure to penicil-lin alone made male mice more aggressive.She arranged formalesin the experimentto be threatened byan unfamiliarmale be-longingto a strain known forbeingbig andhostile. Malesborn ofmothersgiven un-adulterated drinkingwaterall quickly as-sumed a submissive posture when con-fronted with such a stranger. Halfof themalesborn ofmotherstreated with theantibioticdid not, however, submit. In-deed, theyfoughtbackeven though theywere clearlyoutmatched—asdid a ﬁfth ofthe maleswhose mothershad beentreated simultaneouslywith the antibioticand Lactobacillus.All these resultsare in line with the hy-pothesisthatlowdosesofantibiotic aﬀectbehavioursimilarlyto high doses. So,when DrLeclercq and hercolleagueskilledand examined theiranimalsshortlyafterthe behavioural tests, theyexpected to seepermeable blood-brain barriersin themice exposed to penicillin.

Ithas,though, had diﬃcultycreatinga shoelacethatdoesnotaccidentallycome loose. Atleastin part, thisisbecause no one hastrulyunderstood whyshoelacescome un-done in the ﬁrstplace. Butthatcrucial gapin human knowledge hasjustbeenplugged. Astheyreportin the Proceedingsofthe Royal Society, ChristopherDaily-Diamond, Christine Greggand OliverO’Reilly, a group ofengineersatthe Uni-versityofCalifornia, Berkeley, have nowworked outthe mechanicsofshoelace-bowdisintegration.Ashoelace bowisa type ofslip knotthathas, atitscore, a reefknot. Like conven-tional reefknots, bowscan be mistied as“granny” knots, which come undone moreeasilythan a true reefdoes. Buteven ashoelace bowwith a true reefatitscorewill fail eventually, and have to be retied.Walkinginvolvestwo mechanical pro-cesses, both ofwhich mightbe expected toexertforceson a shoelace bow. One is theforward and backmovementofthe leg.The otheristhe impactofthe shoe itselfhittingthe ground. Preliminaryexperi-mentscarried outbyMrDaily-Diamond,MsGreggand DrO’Reillyshowed thatnei-therofthese alone isenough to persuade abowto unravel. Both are needed. So theyhad to devise experimentswhich couldmeasure and record whatwasgoingonwhile someone wasactuallywalking.The “someone” in question wasMsGregg, who endured numeroussessionson a treadmill so thatthe behaviourof hershoelacescould be monitored. Usingcam-eras, and also tinyaccelerometersattachedto the laces, the researchersrealised thattwo thingsare important. One ishowtheactofwalkingdeformsthe reefatthe cen-tre ofa bow. The otherishowthe diﬀerentinertial forceson the straight-ended andlooped extremitiesofthe bowconspire topull the lace though the reefin the way awearerwould when takinga shoe oﬀ.The ﬁrstthingwhich happensduringwalkingisthatthe reefitselfisloosened bythe inertial forcesofthe lace endspullingon it. Thisoccursasa walker’sfootmovesﬁrstforward and then backward asit hitsthe ground duringa stride. Immediatelyafterthat, the shockofimpactdistorts thereefstill further. The combination of pulland distortion loosensthe reef’sgrip onthe lace, permittingitto slip.In principle, the lace could slip eitherway, givingan equal chance ofthe boweventuallyundoingcompletelyorturninginto a non-slip knotofthe sortthat longﬁn-gernailsare needed to deal with. In prac-tice, the formerisfarmore common. Thereason turnsoutto be thatthe free ends ofthe bowcan swingfartherthan the loopedendsdo. The extra inertial force this causesfavoursslippage in the direction ofthe lon-gerofthe free ends. To startwith, the eﬀectissmall.

In English, youcan say“some-one lefthisumbrella” and riskannoyingsome women, or“someone lefttheirum-brella” and riskalienatingsome grammarsticklers. In French, son parapluiecanmean either“his” or“her” umbrella. Butthishardlymeansthere are no problemswith gender, sexand politics inFrance. The French language requires agenderforeverysingle noun and adjec-tive: notonlymen and women, bulls andcows, butalso tablesand chairs, rocks andbricks. (The French for“gender” isgenre,which also means“class” or“type”, asitdoesin English.) Anoun’sgenderrarelyhasanythingto do with itsreal-worldqualities: there’snotmuch feminineaboutla table, oranythingmacho about lechapeau(hat). Butithappensthattitlesofpowerfulpeople, unlike the gendersofhatsand ta-bles, are notrandom: it’sle ministre, le général, le chefd’état(head ofstate), le sénateur, le magistrat. Apattern emerges:whereasa few“generic” wordsare femi-nine (like la personne), all these powerfultitlesare masculine. Agenericpresident isle président, masculine, perhapssubtlynudgingFrench-speakersto thinkof presi-dentsasmen. Onlyifa woman becomesthe actual president—asMarine Le Pen, ofthe National Fronthopesto do in theFrench electionswhich begin on April23rd—doesthe title becomela présidente. The traditional use ofthe masculine asgenerichasrubbed variousFrench peo-ple the wrongway. In 1984, the govern-mentcalled upon the French Academy tolookinto the question offeminising cer-tain titles. The academy, the oﬃcial guard-ian ofthe language since 1635, repliedwith, in eﬀect, a refusal. Titlesthat wereoriginallygrammaticallymasculineshould notbe given feminine versions;“unintended consequences” could result.Grammatical genderonlyoccasionallycorrespondswith biological sex, the aca-demiciansargued. Theyseemed to thinktheyhad the impeccablyfeministposition.Awoman isjustascapable asa man of be-ingle président. (La présidente, saysome tra-ditionalistsgoingfurther, isthe wife ofthepresident. Thiswascertainlythe case a cen-turyago, buttoday’sﬁrstladyin France isknown asthe première dame.)Variousbodiespressed on, ignoring theacademy, which hasno powersofenforce-ment. In 1998 the National Assemblyruledthattitlesrelevantto itsvariousoﬃcers andfunctionsshould be feminised, such as ladeputée and la présidente. In 2014, a deputyfrom the centre-right, Julien Aubert, sidedwith the academyagainstthe chamber’srules, and repeatedlyreferred to the presid-ingoﬃcer, Sandrine Mazetierfrom the op-posingSocialistParty, asmadame le prési-dent, mixingthe feminine personal titleandthemasculinejobtitle.MsMazetier,asshe had the rightto do underthe cham-ber’srules, ﬁned him a quarterofhismonthlysalary, and a debate ensued un-derheadlineslike “When ridicule killsfeminism” and “Should the French Acad-emybe dissolved?”The problem cannotbe entirelyavoid-ed. The academyrightlynotesthatin theplural, the masculine hasalwayscoveredthe feminine too, and writingforexampletousceux(all those who), usingmasculineforms, hasrarelyattracted much atten-tion; the masculine is“unmarked”, mean-ingitcarriesno special meaning, whereasthe feminine is“marked”, orspeciﬁcallyfemale. Writingtoutescellesettousceuxoverand overwould ﬁll French with evenmore lumberingawkwardnessthan re-peated “he orshe” doesin English, giventhe numberofwordsitwould aﬀect inFrench. Wordslike “voters” and “mem-bers” could become the shorter, buttypo-graphicallyuglyand unpronounceableélecteurs/tricesoradhérent(e)s.Fornow, mainstream French opinionisconvergingon a compromise betweenpractical solutionson one hand and theFrench Academy’straditionalism on theother. The masculine isgeneric, especial-lyforplurals: no need forélecteurs/trices.Buttitlesmaybe feminised when doingso isgrammaticallysimple and logical, asitusuallyis. And those who wantto beknown bythem deserve thatcourtesy. MsLe Pen would hardlybe a perfecttribune forfeminism asFrance’shead ofstate. She hasposed asa defenderofwomen’srights, butlargelyin oppositionto the presumed antifeministattitudes ofthe Muslimsshe would like to keep out ofFrance. ManyFrench voters, according topolls, would like to see herkeep her cur-rentjob title—présidenteindeed, butonlyofherown party.

The fall is partly the result ofan investment slowdown in China andJapan, after a huge increase in wind andsolar capacity that was ﬁnanced in 2015.But lower capital costs are also responsi-ble: in dollar terms, solar photovoltaics,onshore wind and oﬀshore wind are atleast 10% cheaper per megawatt thanthey were in 2015. Global installed capac-ity of wind, solar and other renewablesrose by a record 11gigawatts (GW), to138.5GW, in 2016. The costs of generatingthese renewables are now comparablewith fossil-fuel plants. But their futureremains vulnerable to policy changes andto slowing growth in electricity demand.82The EconomistApril15th2017“FROMCleetoheaventhebeaconburns,” runsthe openingline ofA.E.Housman’s“AShropshire Lad”. The Cleehills, risingto 1,700 feet, are the highestpointsin the county. From there, acrossgreen slopesscoured and scattered withruinsofold quarrybuildings, the viewsouth opensoverthe valleyofthe Teme tothe blue hillsofHerefordshire and Worces-tershire. To the slopesclingsClee Hill villagewhich, until itclosed, had Shropshire’shighestpub (called “The Kremlin” because,via the radaraerialson the hill, its juke boxcould pickup Radio Moscow). The solehostelryisnowthe Golden Cross, wherethe regularbeerisHobsonsTwisted Spireand visitorscan play, on ancientbatteredequipment, quoitsand pitch-penny. Abak-eryand postoﬃce stand alongthe main A4117, which isnotverymain here. In fact,because itcrossescommon land, attwopointsitisspanned bya cattle grid. Several othercattle gridslie aroundClee Hill, and itwasone ofthose that ledAdrian Colesto hedgehogs. Atthe time, in-deed for40 years, he wasthe local countycouncillor. The job mostlyinvolved meet-ingsaboutschools, social services, ﬂytip-pingand the like; aswell askeeping an eyeon village greens, commonsand roads. Itshigh pointcame when, as“FatheroftheCouncil”,hesatbesidethequeenatlunchand proposed the loyal toast. Itsturningpointcame in 1982, when hissmall daugh-terran in to tell him thata hedgehog wasstuckunderthe cattle grid atthe end ofthedrive. (“I didn’tchoose hedgehogs,” hesaid later; “I had hedgehogsthrustuponme.”) With cautioussticksand an egg-panhe gotitout, hisﬁrstclose encounter; andrealised he had stumbled on a general pro-blem. There were probablyhedgehogsstuckundercattle gridsall overBritain. Hissolution wasto build a little cornerramp, made ofconcrete orwood and at anangle of20°, up which a hedgehogcouldscramble. He then persuaded the council(he wasin the rightjob) to install them incountygrids. Theyare nowcompulsoryon publicroadsacrossthe country. MajorColesfound himselfgetting exer-cised abouthedgehogs. Theirnumberswere fallingso fastthattheywere almoston the edge ofextinction. Pesticides poi-soned them, and carssquashed them.(MostBritonshave seen onlythattwo-di-mensional sort.) The fencingand paving ofsuburban gardensstopped them foragingforfood. And yettheywere such goodchaps, useful creatures, eatingthe slugsand woodlice no gardenerwanted. Theirdoughtiness, astheyrolled up into a ball toface theirenemies, wassomethinghe, asacareerarmyoﬃcer, could onlyadmire. Heheld nothingagainstthem, exceptthe actu-al diﬃcultyofpickingthem up. He had tapped into a national aﬀectionwhich wasalreadythere. IfBritain had a fa-vourite wild animal, itwasprobablynotthe fox, gallantbutverminous, orthe hare,magical butmoonstruck, butthe bright-eyed pointy-nosed hedgehog, suddenlyappearingon lawnsatdusklike the headofan old brush. The creature had been im-mortalised byBeatrixPotterin hertale ofMrsTiggy-Winkle, the tinylaundresswhostole (butonlyto wash and starch them tilltheyshone) the handkerchiefsoflittle girls. Hot-waterbottle and boxAsMajorColeswarmed to the taskhis gar-den wasinvaded, soon containingmorehedgehogsperacre than anyotherspot inBritain. Hisnextstep wasto found a soci-ety, forwhich he also designed a tie. Itgrewfast. When at85 he retired from running it,the British HedgehogPreservation Societyhad more than 11,000 members. These in-cluded 700 “carers” who would providean injured hedgehogwith a hot-waterbot-tle and a warm box, orputthe small pinkfeetin splints. MajorColestalked regularlyon the BBC, advised vetsand lobbied Par-liament. Duringdroughtshe would send ageneral letterto newspapers, urgingpeo-ple to putoutwaterand catfood. He foughtothersuccessful campaigns,includinggettinghousehold appliancessold with sealed plugs, and worked hardformanycharities; butforthisone he wasfamous. Letterswould arrive from abroadaddressed to “MajorHedgehog, England”.Agrand momentcame in 2014, when anexhibitcalled “HedgehogStreet” won agold medal atthe Royal Horticultural Soci-ety’sshowatHampton Court. Itdisplayedthree suburban gardenslaid outashe rec-ommended, with lush vegetation and ﬁve-inch-square gapsin theirfences, for hedge-hogsto getthrough. MajorColes, now wid-owed and livingatthe Royal HospitalChelsea, presided in hisscarletpensioner’scoatwith hisservice medals, and with acamera-shyhedgehogin hislap.Lower-key, butjustassatisfactory, wasthe celebration atthe Golden Crossin CleeHill in 2012 to markthe BHPS’s30th anni-versary. The pub had renamed itself“TheCrossHedgehog” forthe occasion. Hob-sonshad brewed a newale, “Old Prickly”,and the village bakerysupplied spikyloavesofbread. The head ofthe BHPShadto admitthatnumberswere still falling, by25% in the pastdecade. Butthe rate of de-cline had slowed; a networkwasnowinplace to help, and the hedgehog’splace inBritish heartsand mindsseemed assured.With thatcheeringthought, manya glassofOld Pricklywasraised to MajorColes,and to the movementhe had started withhisegg-pan and hissticks. 7ApricklybusinessMajorAdrian Coles, champion ofBritain’s hedgehogs, died on March 23rd, aged 86ObituaryAdrian ColesTechnology and the race for resourcesJune 7th 2017 AustinJoin the conversation@EconomistEvents#EconSustainabilityExpires April 21st 2017sustainability.economist.comevent-tickets@economist.com212.641.9865Climate change is creating challenges for nearly every industry, and since governments will not provide all the answers, the private sector now needs to play its part.
