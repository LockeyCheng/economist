The courtroom isbuiltwith the bricksofthe OldFortprison, where both NelsonMandela and Mahatma Gandhiwere held. Aglassstrip aroundthe courtroom, allowingpassers-byto see in, represents trans-parency. Above the entrance, the valuesofthe constitution aresetin concrete in the handwritingofthe ﬁrstconstitutionaljudgesafterapartheid—includingthe childlike script ofAlbieSachs, who had to learn to write with hislefthand after thewhite regime’ssecurityservicesblewoﬀhisrightarm. In pain-ful contrastwith itsupliftingsetting, a recentconversation be-tween an Economistjournalistand an oﬃcial workingin thebuildingwas, atthe oﬃcial’srequest, conducted outside and,asa furtherprecaution againstsurveillance bytoday’ssecurityservices, the journalistwasasked to leave herphone inside. Itisa measure ofhowfarSouth Africa hasfallen from the idealsitembraced when itwasreborn afterapartheid.UnderPresidentJacob Zuma, the state isfailing. Contractsare awarded through bribesand connections; ruling-partymembersmurdereach otheroverlucrative governmentjobs;crooksoperate with impunity.Nextweekcomesa momentthatmaydetermine whetherSouth Africa slidesfurtherinto thismire orstartsto recover. Ataconference thatstartson December16th the rulingAfricanNational Congress(ANC) isdue to choose the successorto MrZuma asitsleader, and thusitscandidate forpresidency ofthecountry. The front-runnersare MrZuma’sex-wife and pre-ferred candidate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and the deputypresident, Cyril Ramaphosa. ForSouth Africa and forthewhole African continent, MrRamaphosa needsto win.Mandela weepsSouth Africa isno longerin the forefrontofthe world’scon-sciousness, asitwasin the 1990swhen itmade itsmiraculous-lypeaceful transition from a racistregime to a modern democ-racy. Butitstill matters, and notjustto its57m people. With itssuperiorﬁnancial and physical infrastructure, itis Africa’seco-nomichub. Itsdiplomaticand moral authorityshapessouth-ern Africa, forworse aswell asbetter: withoutitssupport, Rob-ertMugabe would have lostpowerin Zimbabwe longago.And, atthe moment, itisthe site ofthe mostvisible battle in theworld between good and bad government.Alarmed South Africanshave watched the progressof“state capture”, wherebyprivate actorssubvertthe state tosteal publicmoney(see page 21). In a reportin 2016 the formerpublicprotectordetailed allegationsthatthe Guptas, businessassociatesofMrZuma’sfamily, oﬀered the ﬁnance ministry toapolitician theyhoped would be pliable and used political in-ﬂuence to lootstate-owned enterprises. She called for a judi-cial inquiry. MrZuma sayshe hasno knowledge ofthe job of-fer, and will establish an inquiry, buthe claimsthat the publicprotector’sdemand thatthe judge in charge mustbe appoint-ed bythe chiefjustice isunconstitutional. He did not commenton the matteroflootingfrom state-owned enterprises.Whatisunusual aboutSouth Africa isnotthatcorruptionthrives, butthatitdoesso in plain sight. Thanksto a historyofcivicactivism, a free pressand a robustjudiciary, South Afri-cansare aware ofthe wholesale theft. Investigative journalistshave catalogued corruption atall levelsofgovernment. Weekafterweek, activistsand opposition partieschallenge the gov-ernmentin court. Aformerﬁnance ministerestimates that150bn-200bn ($11bn-15bn) rand, 5% ofGDP, hasbeen ﬁlched.The ANCleadership election oﬀerswhatoughtto be aneasychoice. MsDlamini-Zuma isexpected to protecther ex-husband, who faces783 countsofcorruption. She, like him, es-pouses“radical economictransformation”, which involvesﬁs-cal indiscipline and expropriation. She, like him, employs ra-ciallycharged rhetoricto deﬂectcriticism. Avictory forherwould undermine the economy, jeopardise social harmony—fragile, in a countrywith the ﬁfth highestmurderrate in theworld—and entrench state capture.Cyril vcynicismMrRamaphosa’selection would noton itsown ensure a swiftreturn to clean government. Corruption runsdeep, atall levelsofthe party. Itdid nothelp thata pre-Zuma ANCpolicyof“em-powering” blacktycoonsbyencouragingthe transferof largestakesin white-owned ﬁrmsto them made a handful of ANCbigwigseﬀortlesslyrich. Thisseta precedentthatpolitics in thenewSouth Africa can be a shortcutto vastwealth. One ofthebiggestbeneﬁciarieswasMrRamaphosa himself, which com-plicateshiscampaign to purge the partyofrent-seeking. None-theless, there isno suggestion thathe broke the law, and he isoutspoken in hiscondemnation ofthose who nowbrazenlydo so. He isalso pragmaticin hisplansto boosteconomicgrowth and provide South Africanswith jobsand education. The numberssuggestMrRamaphosa isin the lead, yet he isnota shoo-in. The stakesare high forMrZuma and his politicalskillsare consummate. Those who betagainsthim tend to lose.Hiscompatriotsawaitthe resultnervously. Some well-intentioned South Africansthinkitwould bebetterifMsDlamini-Zuma won, because the countryhas be-come too much like a one-partystate, and an ANCrun byherwould be more likelyto lose the election in 2019. Thatisa dan-gerousargument. The multiracial, centristDemocratic Alli-ance would indeed be betterthan the ANC, and isgaininginpopularity: itnowgovernsthe country’sthree mostimportantcities. Butthe hard-leftEconomicFreedom Fighters, who mightbe worse than the ANC, are gainingground, too. And the ANC,with itsliberationistcredentials, mightwin in 2019 even underMsDlamini-Zuma, who aspresidentwould cementthe Zumaclan’sgrip on the leversofpower. South Africa would starttolookuncomfortablylike a hereditarykleptocracy.Itspeople deserve better. The rainbownation still hasthepotential to be a beacon ofprosperityand good governance inAfrica, butmemoriesofitshopeful birth are a melancholycounterpointto itsdarkpresent. The bestchance for recoveringthatoptimism isa victoryforMrRamaphosa.7The corruption ofSouth AfricaTo avoid a dire, two-decade dynastyofdysfunction, the ruling ANC should ditch the ZumasLeaders14LeadersThe EconomistDecember9th20171AFTERthe Maidan revolutionand the startofthe RussianwaragainstUkraine in 2014,Western policyhad two aims: tohaltand punish Russian aggres-sion and to help Ukraine be-come a democraticstate gov-erned bythe rule oflaw.America imposed sanctionson Russia, ordered the president,Petro Poroshenko, to establish an anti-corruption force andsentJoe Biden, then vice-president, on repeated visits to insiston ﬁghtinggraft. The EUimposed sanctionson Russia, andmade supportforcivil-societyand the rule oflawa linchpin ofthe association agreementitsigned with Ukraine in 2014.In thatlight, the newsoutofUkraine overthe past fewweekshasbeen dire. The country’sprosecutor-general hasdis-rupted investigationsbyitsNational Anti-corruption Bureau,with the apparentconsentofMrPoroshenko. The interior min-isterhasintervened to protecthisson from similarscrutiny. Of-ﬁcersin the securityservice, the SBU, have tried to arrestMik-heil Saakashvili, the formerGeorgian presidentturnedUkrainian corruption-ﬁghter, onlyto be driven backby protes-ters. Prosecutorsare targetinganti-corruption activists; thearmy, interior-ministrytroopsand private militiaswork atcross-purposes, answeringto diﬀerentpoliticiansor oligarchs.MrPoroshenko’sgovernmenthasbeen seriouslyweakened.To some Europeansand Americans, thispicture suggeststhattheireﬀortsto persuade Ukraine to turn overa newleafwere alwaysdoomed to fail. Thatisa misreading. In fact, the re-centchaosin Ukraine comesin partbecause in the past year,especiallysince the inauguration ofPresidentDonald Trump,Europe and America have eased the pressure. Iftheydo notre-store theircommitmentto defendinganti-corruption reforms,Ukraine riskssinkingbackinto the morassfrom which ittriedto extricate itselfwith Maidan.Ukraine’sgrubbypoliticiansand oligarchshave tried tofrustrate Western aimswithoutopenlydefyingthem (see page45). Partlyasa result, policyunderMrTrump haslost itsfocuson ﬁghtinggraft. KurtVolker, the American envoyto Ukraine,workson external security; America maysoon sell the coun-trylethal weaponsforthe ﬁrsttime. Butwhen the State Depart-mentcomplainsaboutcorruption, itisignored—because (un-like MrBiden) the White House oﬀersitno support. As fortheEU, fewbelieve itwould jeopardise itsassociation agreementwith Ukraine forthe sake ofthe rule oflaw. So, the country’selite no longerfearsattackinginvestigatorsand activists.Layoﬀthe pay-oﬀsIftheysucceed in endingthe attemptsto ﬁghtgraft, itwill be adisasterforUkraine—and a step backforEurope and America,too. The countryisthe focal pointofthe West’sconﬂictwithRussia. Weakand divided, itisvulnerable to Russian encroach-ment, especiallyifVladimirPutin decideshe needsto ﬁre uppatrioticRussian voters. Chaoswould also buttressMr Putin’sclaim thatthe West’saimsin Ukraine are purelyanti-Russianand have nothingto do with democracyorthe rule oflaw. Allthiswould undermine the rules-based global order, with con-sequencesin the South China Sea and elsewhere.NowthatUkraine isdefyingcomplaintsbyAmerica’sStateDepartmentand the EU’sforeign-policyarm, itisvital thatAmerica and Europe use everytool attheirdisposal to supportcorruption-ﬁghtersin Kiev. The EUshould make plain thatthebeneﬁtsofthe association pactdepend on progressagainstgraft; America should attach the same conditionsto armssales. Prosecutorsin Western capitalsshould investigate thelaunderingofill-gotten Ukrainian wealth. Supportfor Uk-raine’sterritorial integrityshould notinvolve tolerance forthelackofintegrityamongitspoliticians. 7UkraineDon’tgive upUkraine is a mess. The Westshould press itharderto bring its elites into lineSOME political theoristsarguethatthe lawdrawslegitimacynotjustfrom voting, butalsofrom publicdebate before legis-lation ispassed. In votingthrough a tax-reform bill on De-cember2nd, RepublicansinCongresshave tested thisprinci-ple to destruction. The bill, like most, hasitsstrengths and itsweaknesses, butRepublicanshave rushed itthrough disre-gardingthe value ofconsistencyand evidence. Theirsuccesswill weigh on the qualityofAmerican government.The Senate’sbill isbroadlysimilarto one thatpassed in theHouse ofRepresentativesin November. Itwould slash the cor-porate taxrate from 35% to 20% (albeita yearlaterthan theHouse bill). Taxesforunincorporated businessesand individ-ualswould fall substantially. The personal exemption, whichreducesa household’staxable income in accordance with itssize, would be replaced with a much higherstandard deduc-tion, the ﬂatamountthatcan be earned tax-free. The child taxcreditwould also rise. To raise money, the bill curbs some de-ductions, such asthose fordebtinterestand state levies.Lawmakersreconcilingthe billsconfrontthree main diﬀer-ences.

Itisright to do so,though itwould double the threshold atwhich the tax kicksin,from $22.4m (forcouples). Third, the Senate hastacked on a re-peal ofObamacare’sindividual mandate, a ﬁne forAmericanswho do notbuyhealth insurance even iftheycan aﬀord it. One testofthe ﬁnal bill isitseﬀecton the economy. On theone hand itwould limitdeductionsin favourofcutsto margin-al taxrates—a worthwhile reform. On the otheritwill increaseinequality, largelybecause business-ownerstend to be rich,and itwill add a trillion dollarsin publicborrowing by2027,accordingto an oﬃcial projection forthe Senate’sbill.Butthere isanothertest, which isthe eﬀecton governance.The Republicanshave argued thattheirbill isaimed at helpingmiddle-classAmericansand thatitwill sparkenough eco-nomicgrowth to payforitself. Thisisbelied byexperience—witnessthe rise in deﬁcitsafterthe taxcutsof1981and the early2000s(see page 31). Noteven economistsin sympathetic think-tanksbelieve thatthe Republican claimswill be borne out.Steve Mnuchin, the treasurysecretary, hasfailed to produceanyanalysisjustifyinghispredictionsofmuch higher growth(hisdepartment’sinspector-general isinvestigatingwhy not).The Treasurydid, however, delete a studyfrom itswebsite thatwasunhelpful to the administration’sargument. All politiciansexaggerate the beneﬁtsoftheirpolicies, andsome Republicanshave made unconvincingclaimsabouttherewardsoftaxcutsfordecades. However, in the 1980sthe partyundertooka robustdebate overthe meritsofsupply-side eco-nomics, and in the 2000sGeorge W. Bush’sown economistscautioned againstover-rosygrowth forecasts. Thistime, mostRepublican senatorssimplybrushed oﬀthe oﬃcial projectionthatthe bill’seﬀectswould contradicttheirsunnypromises. Inaddition, theyattacked the independentforecasterswhomtheyhave previouslychampioned asa valuable restraint onself-servingpoliticians. And to minimise scrutiny, they rushedthe bill through barelya dayafterthe forecastwasreleased.Perhaps, afterthe failure ofhealth-care reform, they were des-perate fora signiﬁcantlegislative achievement. AlackofconsistencymakesRepublicansseem unprinci-pled. Theyhave spentthe pastdecade claimingthatthe nation-al debtisamongtheirmain concerns. In 2009 theyopposedPresidentBarackObama’sﬁscal stimulus, arguingthat itwasunaﬀordable. Yetitcostlessthan today’staxbill would. Itpassed when unemploymentwasover8% and interestrateswere stucknearzero. Todayunemploymentis4.1% and rateshave started risingbecause the Federal Reserve isworriedaboutinﬂation. The Fed will probablyraise ratesfaster afterthe taxbill, limitingthe boostto economicgrowth. The whiﬀofself-enrichmentdoesnothelp. President Do-nald Trump assuresAmericansthatthe bill will be “notgood”forhisbankbalance. Withoutseeinghistaxreturns, thatisim-possible to know. Buthe holdsinterestsin around 500 “pass-through” businesses, which are amongthe main beneﬁciariesofthe taxbill. Asa propertydeveloper, he isalmost uniquelyfortunate in beingallowed to keep mostofhistaxexemptions.Talking is goodWhen Democratscried foul afterthe bill passed, MitchMcConnell, the Senate leader, retorted that: “Youcomplainaboutprocesswhen youare losing.” Nonsense. Arobustandfactual debate isessential to good policymaking. The erosionofstandardswill feed on itself. Already, some voices on the leftare sayingthatdeﬁcitsshould neveragain stop Democratsfrom spendingfreelywhen theyare in power. In a country fac-inga huge long-term ﬁscal shortfall, thatisa worrying thought. Democracyrequiresdeliberation, and deliberation re-quireshonesty. Afterthisbill, a greatfearofthe Founding Fa-thers—a politicsofwarringfactionsand interests, scrappingoverthe publicpurse—lookscloserthan ever. 7JERUSALEM isboth heavenlyand earthly, holyand sinful.“Ten measuresofbeautyGodgave to the world, nine to Jerusa-lem and one to the rest,” saystheTalmud. Sometimes, however, itseemsasiften measuresof suf-feringGod gave to the world,nine to Jerusalem and one to the rest. The medieval Arab geog-rapher, al-Muqaddasi, called the holycity“a golden bowl fullofscorpions”.In announcingthisweekthatAmerica recognised Jerusa-lem asthe capital ofIsrael, and would startthe process ofmov-ingthe American embassythere from Tel Aviv(see page 41),PresidentDonald Trump claimed to be honouringIsrael’sde-mocracy. He was, he said, simplyacknowledgingreality; hestill soughtpeace between the Palestiniansand the Israelis. Infact, hismove hasthe nastystingofa scorpion. Israel isunusual in havinga capital thatisnotrecognised bythe restofthe world. No countrykeepsan embassyin Jerusa-lem. Thisoddityisa productofhistory. After1947, when the UNvoted to partition the then-British mandate ofPalestine, Jeru-salem wasdeclared an international city, partneither ofthe fu-ture Jewish state norofthe Arab one. Butin the subsequentwarIsrael and Jordan divided the cityand two decades later, inthe warof1967, Israel captured and annexed EastJerusalem.Arab residentswere given a special status, butbuilding pro-jects, population policiesand, latterly, the security barrierallserved to strengthen the Jewsin their“eternal and undividedcapital”. The Oslo accordsof1993, which created an autono-mousPalestinian Authority, leftthe statusofJerusalem asoneofseveral “ﬁnal statusissues” to be settled in a permanentpeace between Israel and the Palestinians.Congresscalled forthe American embassyto be moved toJerusalem, and presidential candidatesoften promised to doso. In oﬃce, though, theyalwaysfound reasonsto delay. NowMrTrump claimsto be bringing“veryfresh thinking” to theMiddle East: “I’ve judged thiscourse ofaction to be in the bestinterestsofthe United StatesofAmerica and the pursuit ofpeace between Israel and the Palestinians.” Itwill help neither.Peace in the Middle EastThis yearin JerusalemDonald Trump’s recognition ofJerusalem is reckless16LeadersThe EconomistDecember9th201712To begin with, itisan admission offailure. MrTrump ispre-judgingthe outcome ofthe “ultimate deal” ofIsraeli-Palestin-ian peace thathe claimsto be pursuing. He hasgiven Israel theprize ofrecognition withoutextractinganythingin return, anddoesnotmention Palestinians’ rightto statehood. Thathasboth weakened hisown inﬂuence in anypeace talksandAmerica’sclaim to be a fairmediatorbetween the Israelis andthe Palestinians. Second, MrTrump hasfurtherdiscredited thealreadyfeeble Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and allthose who argue thatPalestinian aspirationscan be met byne-gotiation ratherthan violence. Third, he hasembarrassed Araballies, and made itharderforthem to move towardsa de factoalliance with Israel to counteractthe expansion ofIran’sinﬂu-ence in the Middle East.MrTrump perhapscalculatesthatArab regimesare too con-cerned with othercrisesto botherwith Palestine, and thatthePalestiniansare too divided and dispirited to do much aboutit.Yeteven ifthe prospectofPalestinian unrestismuted, MrTrump pointlesslyrisksstokingviolence.MrTrump isatpainsto saythatAmerica will accept anyfu-ture deal on Jerusalem thatIsrael and the Palestinians canagree on. In practice the United States, like mostother coun-tries, alreadytreatsJerusalem asIsrael’scapital. Itsdiplomatsand politicians—includingpresidents—routinelymeetIsraeliministersin Jerusalem. Yetifrecognition makeslittle practicaldiﬀerence, whydid MrTrump bother?The answerhasnothingto do with American policyin theMiddle Eastand everythingto do with domesticpolitics. Athome MrTrump hasstruggled to enacthispromisesbecauseofresistance in Congressand the courts. Abroad, though, hehasnowhonoured a radical promise—one hispredecessorswere too fecklessto keep. Ithelps, too, thathiselectoral baseadmiresIsrael and dislikesArabs; and thatmanyevangelicalsthinkthe ingatheringofthe Jewswill hasten the end ofdays.MrTrump would have been bestadvised notto touch Jeru-salem atall. Itshould have been leftasthe crown in a ﬁnalpeace agreement. Butifhe mustshake thingsup, then heshould double down on hisradicalism: open notone embassyin Jerusalem buttwo. One would manage tieswith Israel andthe otherin EastJerusalem would deal with the Palestinianstate, which he should also recognise. Two embassiesfor twostatesfortwo peoples: thatwould be trulyfresh thinking. 7TWO letterscan add up to alotofmoney. No area oftech-nologyishotterthan AI, orartiﬁ-cial intelligence.

Theysee AIasa wayto improve theirexistingservices, from cloudcomputingto logistics, and to push into newareas, from auton-omouscarsto augmented reality(see page 55). Manyobserv-ersfearthat, bycementingand extendingthe powerof a hand-ful ofgiants, AIwill hurtcompetition. Thatwill depend onthree open questions, involvingone magicingredient.AlphaGoneThe tech giantscertainlyhave bigadvantagesin the battle todevelop AI.

ForPresidentDonald Trump itis “adisaster”. MrTrump would notbe alone in balkingatMrAze-vêdo’sformulation, meanttomanage down expectationsforthe WTO’stwo-yearlyministerial meetingin Argentina laterthismonth (see page 63). The WTOhasnotachieved a bigbreakthrough in itsmission oftrade liberalisation for morethan two decades. Itslastbiground oftrade talks, the Doha De-velopmentAgenda, became the Jarndyce vJarndyceoftradediplomacy; in 2015 itwasquietlyputoutofitsmisery.Ifonlya disappointingrecord were the biggestproblem forthe WTO. America hashad fraughtrelationswith itfor years;underMrTrump, frustration hasturned to aggression. Ameri-ca feelsthatChina, the world’sbiggestexporter, hasused theWTOto provide legal coverfora policyofmercantilism. Rath-erthan help the WTOﬁnd solutions, the administration haspreferred to undermine it, through a mixture ofpolicy unilat-eralism, rhetorical criticism and bureaucraticsabotage. Thatapproach iswrong. The WTOiseasyto criticise and take forgranted. Butitisvital forthe world economy—and for America. You’ll miss me when I’m goneSo far, MrTrump hasnotcarried outthe mostdrastic ofthetrade threatshe made so loudlyon the campaign trail: acrossthe board, 45% tariﬀson importsfrom China, pluswithdrawalfrom the WTOand North American Free-Trade Agreement(NAFTA). Buthe still seestrade asa zero-sum game that Ameri-ca hasbeen losing, in which importsare bad, exports are goodand a bilateral trade balance isthe scoresheet. Because ofitsheft, the thinkinggoes, America will alwayswin in bilateraltrade dealswhere itcan bullythe countryon the other side ofthe table. Ifonlyitcould exploititsadvantages, it argues, itwould force open foreign marketsoruse trade asa bargainingchip to pursue itswiderinterests—securingChinese help, say,to rein in North Korea’snuclearambitions.And so MrTrump’soﬃcialshave, directlyand byneglect,taken aim atthe multilateral tradingsystem. Theyhave openlycriticised the WTO. Theyhave sidestepped it, resorting todustyAmerican lawsto investigate unilaterallyimports ofsuch productsassteel and aluminium goods, solarcells andwashing-machines. The investigationsinto steel and alumi-nium were instigated undera lawfrom 1962 thathad notbeenused since 2001. Whereasthe use ofthe WTOquarantinesdis-putes, byturningthem into dry, technocraticaﬀairs, “self-initi-ated” actionspoliticise even routine complaints.Athird form ofattackismore insidious. America has failedto appointitsown permanentrepresentative to the WTO. And,citingarcane procedural concerns, ithaskeptopen vacanciesforjudgeson the WTO’sappealscourt. The courtalready hasabacklogofcases. Ifthe gapsare notﬁlled, the system forset-tlingdisputesisatriskofcollapse. Ifcountriesthen take retalia-tion into theirown hands, the WTOitselfmayfollow.Itisunclearifthe administration reallywantsthat. Itissup-portingthe European Union in a case broughtatthe WTObyChina, which wants“market-economy” status. Thiswouldmake itharderto impose stiﬀanti-dumpingdutieson Chineseexports. America seemsto recognise the WTO’scontinuedusefulnesshere. Perhaps, then, America hopesthe pressurewill spurreform ofthe body. Yetthatline looksoptimistic,since America hasnotspelled outwhatitwantsto change.Instead, the administration seemsto wantthe bestof allworlds; usingthe WTO when itsuitsit, while puttingits energyinto bilateral strong-arm tactics. Yetthatwould not be good forAmerica, either. The tariﬀsitkeepsthreateningwould raisepricesforitsown consumers. Exportsthatrelyon importedcomponentswould become lesscompetitive: the Americancarindustrysaystariﬀson partsfrom Mexico would increaseitscostsby$16bn-27bn a year. Partnerswould be likelier to re-taliate directlyratherthan seekredressthrough the WTO. Ifthe WTO were shunned bythe world’sbiggesteconomyitmightnotcollapse, butitwould wither. Thatwould indeedbe a disaster. The WTOisrooted in the vision ofa liberal worldorderAmerica hasled since the second world war. Itlinksnearlyall the world’scountriesin an agreed rules-basedframework. Some Americansargue thatithasfailed in itsmostambitiousventure: bindingthe state-dominated Chineseeconomy, admitted in 2001, into a fairtradingsystem. China’smarketreformshave indeed disappointed. Butviewed anoth-erway, the WTO hassmoothed the disruption caused bythereintegration into the world ofwhatisnowitssecond-largesteconomy. Itremainsthe bestwayoftryingto make China playbythe rules. In a trade war, no countrywould win. 7The World Trade OrganisationDisastermanagementWTO active disputes*As of November0102030402005101517*The WTO is ﬂawed.

The central issuein the leadership contestiscorruption. “Decemberrepresentsa binarymo-mentforSouth Africa,” saysColin Cole-man, head ofGoldman Sachs’sSouth Afri-ca oﬃce. MrColeman supportsMrRamaphosa, asdo COSATU(the trade-un-ion movement, from which MrRama-phosa hails) and the South African Com-munistParty. Goldman Sachs, unionsandthe CommunistPartyrarelyﬁnd them-selveson the same side, buthostility to MrZuma hasmade forstrange—and numer-ous—bedfellows. Duringhissecond termin power, the presidenthasalienated al-mostall ofbigbusiness, civil-society orga-nisations, the churchesand the unionmovement, alongwith much ofhisparty.The principal charge againstMrZuma isof“state capture”. Unfamiliarelsewhere inthe world, the term isin widespread use inSouth Africa, especiallysince the publica-tion in October2016 of“State ofCapture”, areportbyThuli Madonsela, the formerpublicprotector—an ombudsman whosepowersare guaranteed bythe constitution.Itinvestigated claimsthatthe three Guptabrothers, businessassociatesofMrZuma’sson, Duduzane, had excessive inﬂuenceoverSouth African politics, from whichtheyproﬁted. MsMadonsela concludedthatthere were manyquestionsto answer,and called fora judicial inquiry. Captive audienceThe nub ofthe “state capture” argumentisthatMrZuma and hisfriendsare puttingstate-owned enterprisesand othergovern-mental institutionsin the handsofpeoplewho are allowingthem to lootpublicfunds. The result, accordingto Pravin Gord-han, twice MrZuma’sﬁnance minister,ﬁred mostrecentlyin March thisyear, isthat“150bn-200bn rand ($11bn-15bn) hasbeen looted.” Some global companiesareimplicated (see nextstory).The mostegregiousexample ofinterfer-ence in political appointmentsconcernsthe ﬁnance ministry.

In 2016, afterthe deliveryofthe re-port, MrGordhan and MrPillaywerecharged with fraud. The chargeswere soondropped.

Ifitwasnot, itsfee lookslike a kickback.Trillian’sformerchairman asked GeoﬀBudlender, a South African lawyer, to pro-duce a reporton the matter.

Buta (since departed) McKin-seypartnerwrote in a letterto Eskom’sCEO that“McKinseyhassubcontracted aportion ofthe servicesto be performed un-derthe agreementto Trillian.” David Fine, McKinsey’sglobal head ofpublicand social sectors, told a South Afri-can parliamentarycommittee investigat-ingstate capture atEskom thatthe lettersayingthatTrillian wasa subcontractorwasinaccurate.

Yetittookmuch debateand a change in the lawbefore the govern-mentcould even seta date forhim to do so.When itﬁnallydid, on December1st, itde-ferred the eventforovera year, to April30th, 2019. Butatleastthe long-suﬀeringemperor, Akihito, will be allowed to stepdown, even though the lawpreviouslysaid thatthe emperorrulesuntil his death.The throne will passto hisson, Naru-hito, 57, and a newera in the Japanese cal-endarwill begin. Scholarsare busyﬁndinganame forit. The currentera, Heisei,roughlymeans“peace everywhere”.Japan’sgovernmenthasgranted theemperor’swish with a manifestlackof en-thusiasm. Akihito tookthe unusual step ofrevealinghisdesire to abdicate in a videomessage aired on NHK, the publicbroad-caster. He probablymade the requestpub-licforfearthata private inquirywouldhave been buried bythe government. InJune parliamentapproved a lawallowinghim, butonlyhim, to renounce the throne. Afterthe second world war, which Ja-pan foughtin the name ofthe emperor ofthe day, Hirohito (Akihito’sfather), the oc-cupyingAmerican forcescurbed the au-thorityofthe monarchy. The constitutiontheyimposed restricted the emperorto apurelysymbolicrole. Conservatives, in-cludingShinzo Abe, the prime minister,wantto preserve whatisleftofthe imperi-al mystique. The governmenthaseven re-stricted archaeologists’ accessto royaltombs, forfear, manysuspect, thattheymightﬁnd thatthe imperial family’sDNAdoesnotin factderive, unadulterated, fromthe sun goddess, Amaterasu, oreven frompure Japanese stock, butincludestraces ofKorean and Chinese ancestry.Katsuyuki Yakushiji ofToyo Universityin Tokyo reckonsAkihito hopeshisabdica-tion will sparka debate abouthowto mo-dernise the imperial family. Akihito isknown forhisliberal views. Since becom-ingemperorin 1989 he hasapologised forJapan’swartime pastduringforeign trips.Hisfrequentpublicappearancesin Japanhave made him seem lessaloofthan previ-ousemperors. He isextremelypopular.There are three obviousreforms, allconcerningimperial sexism: to allowprin-cesseswho marrycommonersto remainin the imperial familyand thusbe able tocarryoutoﬃcial duties; to allowthe sonsofprincessesto inheritthe throne, thus ex-pandingthe pool ofpotential heirs, and toallowwomen to inheritthe throne them-selves. Given the dwindlingstockofroyalboys—Akihito’sﬁrstthree grandchildrenwere girls—such changesmightseem desir-able, even to conservatives. Butthe arrival11yearsago ofa male grandson, the son ofNaruhito’syoungerbrother, sapped theimpetusforreform. The lawthatallowsAkihito to stepdown contained a woollyresolution thatseemsto call forconsideration ofthe ﬁrsttwo reforms. The third wasdeemed tooradical, even though women have reignedin the past. MrAbe hasappeared to ques-tion even the second idea, pointingoutthatthe monarchyhasmanaged to remainpatrilineal forovertwo millennia.Takashi Mikuriya, the deputychair ofthe advisorypanel on the emperor’sabdi-cation, told a national newspaperthat Aki-hito’sretirement“opensa sealed box”. Thepublicseemsopen to change, too.

Both men grewdicta-torial in power, resorted to violence to settle scoresand, in Zia’scase, embraced Islamism in an avowedlysecularstate. Yet thememoryofeach isburnished bytheirrespective parties, nowrunasﬁefsbythe two begums: Sheikh Hasina’sAwami League (AL)and MrsZia’sBangladesh NationalistParty(BNP).Between 1991and 2006 the metronome gave MrsZia twoturnsin powerand Sheikh Hasina one, thanksin partto caretakergovernmentsinstalled before each election. Thiscompetitionhelped avoid some ofthe worstabusesofpower. Notbefore orsince hasBangladesh’spressbeen so vibrantand free. Yet itwasno golden era. In opposition both the ALand the BNPdid all theycould to frustrate government, walkingoutofparliament andshuttingdown the economywith hartals, general strikes. In pow-er, both partiesstucktheirsnoutsin the trough—though the BNP’ssecond term in oﬃce wasespeciallyegregious.Smashing the metronomeWhen Sheikh Hasina came to powerforthe second time, in 2009,she tooka more aggressive approach, goingafterherenemies andsettlingscores, some ofwhich dated backto the warof indepen-dence from Pakistan. In particular, she setup a (domestic) Inter-national CrimesTribunal to prosecute atrocitiescommitted dur-ingthe war. Areckoningwasneeded, butthe tribunal was deeplyﬂawed, violatingdefendants’ rightsand open to political med-dling. The tribunal hashanged halfa dozen defendants, includ-inga close adviserto MrsZia. The leadership ofthe BNP’sIslamistformercoalition partner, Jamaat-e-Islami, wasdestroyed. In otherways, too, Sheikh Hasina hasoutsmarted MrsZia,who showssignsoffrailtyand whose son and political heir, Ta-rique Rahman, cannotreturn from exile in London because ofcorruption chargesawaitinghim in Bangladesh. When SheikhHasina refused to give wayto a caretakergovernmentbefore thegeneral election of2014, the BNPplayed into herhandsbyboy-cottingthe poll and encouragingviolence.

MrXi hasalready giv-en the system hisseal ofapproval. The lawislikelyto be approved atthe nextmeetingofthe legislature, in March. The Commu-nistParty’sauthorityissetto become evenmore entrenched. 7THE state ofChina’ssmallestroomsisno small matter. So said Xi Jinping, theCommunistParty’sgeneral secretary, instatementscarried prominentlybystatemedia lastmonth. Forthree yearsnationaland local authoritieshave been busilyscrubbingup the country’spubliclavato-ries, an eﬀortthe partyhasdubbed the“toiletrevolution”. Havinghitthe pro-gramme’soriginal setoftargets, Mr Xi isre-questinganotherpush.In the pastfewdecadesChina has doneafairlygood job ofsupplyingbasicsanita-tion. Only2% ofChinese still do their busi-nessin the bushes, compared with 40% inIndia; three-quartershave accessto toiletswhich the World Health Organisationdeemsacceptable, up from lessthan two-thirdsin 2000. Butabout70m still useshared facilities, and 260m continue to relyon bucketloos, open pitsand othergrungyfacilities. Some are literallylethal: lastmonth police traced a huge blastin the portcityofNingbo, which killed two people,backto an explodingseptictank.Asecond problem forthe partyis thatChina’smiddle classesare growingeverlessinclined to tolerate the rankstate ofpublictoilets, which can be ﬁlthyeven inbigcities. Poisonoussmellswaftfromsquattingpansthatmaynotbe hidden incubicles. Loo roll isa luxuryand hand soapvanishinglyrare, even in places, includingsome hospitals, where itisessential. Risingdomestictourism meansthatmore andmore Chinese are comingface to face withgrittyprovincial and roadside privies.Asteadysuccession ofoﬃcial initia-tiveshasgraduallyimproved matters.Since 2003 oﬃcialshave operated a na-tional ratingsystem forpublictoilets, simi-larto the star-gradingsforhotels. In 2012authoritiesin Beijingissued a much-mocked circularstipulatingthattoiletblocksshould contain no more than twoﬂies. MrXi’s“toiletrevolution” began in2015, when the tourism ministrylaunchedathree-yearloo-upgradingprogramme. Itsaysthatithassupervised the building orrenovation of68,000 toiletssince then.Alotofthe newloosare in scenic ruralspots; the hope isthattheywill beneﬁtboth villagersand visitors. Meanwhile cityplannershave started requiringdevelop-ersto provide more female toiletsthanmale ones(a reform forwhich some wom-en had longcampaigned), and are growingmore enamoured ofunisexones. Show-boatingauthoritiesin some well-oﬀplaceshave ﬂooded ﬂashynewtoiletblocks withfree Wi-Fi, phone-chargingand vendingmachines. Earlierthisyeartoiletsnear theTemple ofHeaven, one ofBeijing’sbiggesttouristdraws, were ﬁtted with facial-recog-nition systemsdesigned to preventthievesfrom abscondingwith itsloo roll (the tech-nologypreventstoilet-paperdispensersfrom servingeach visitormore than once).More isto come. On World ToiletDay, aUN-sponsored eventcelebrated annuallyon November19th, a seniortourism oﬃcialpromised thathisagencywould notonly“consolidate the fruitsofthe lastround ofthe toiletrevolution” butalso “open up anewchapter”. In a statementpadded withreverentreferencesto the CommunistParty’sjust-concluded congress, he prom-ised to improve orconstructanother64,000 toiletsbythe end of2020.The hope isthatcleanertoiletswill bothimprove publichealth, and boosttouristreceipts, which the governmenthopeswillswell by11% a year. Chinese manufacturershope thatswankynewpublicfacilities willboostthe marketforsmarttoilets, in whichtheycompete ﬁercelywith the Japanese.Lesswhiningfrom foreign visitorswouldalso provide a ﬁllip to national pride.Asforpolitics, some wonderifMr Xi’sveryvisible supportforbetterlavatories isdesigned to painthim asa man ofthe peo-ple.

PresidentDonald Trump likesto call itthe biggesttaxcutin history. MrTrump’sclaim iseasilydisproved (see chart). Yetthecomparison with the lawof1986, passedunderRonald Reagan, ismore curious.There isno doubttoday’sbill, like the olderone, containssigniﬁcantreforms. But thediﬀerencesbetween the two eﬀortsstandoutmore than the similarities. Theyare notquite mirrorimagesofeach other—buttheyare notfaroﬀ.There are three main diﬀerencesbe-tween then and now. First, the centrepieceoftoday’sbill isa cutin the corporate taxrate, from 35% to 20%. Atﬁrstglance, thisseemscomparable to the change to thelevyin 1986, when itfell from 46% to—afterabriefdelay—34%. Yetsuch wasthe vol-ume ofdeductionsthatthe 1986 reformsweptaway, thatitin factraised averagetaxeson businesses. Notably, investmentincentiveswere sharplycurtailed. Today’sbill expandsthem, allowingbusinesses todeductthe full costofinvestmentsin theyeartheyare made (until 2023). Manyeconomistssee these investmentincen-tivesasa powerful stimulusforthe econ-omy. Because the reform of1986 weakenedthem, and also raised capital gainstaxes,Centre forAmerican Progress, a left-lean-ingthink-tank, the taxsystem asa wholereduced the GINIindex, a measure ofin-equality, by5% before the reform, butby 7%afterit.Today’sbill issharplyregressive, de-spite the factthatitbarelytouches the toprate oftax. Thatispartlybecause MrTrump’spriorityhasbeen taxcutsfor busi-nesses, whose ownerstend to be rich. True,the bill curbssome corporate deductions,such asa taxbreakformanufacturers, andanotherfordebtinterest. Butthese changesdo notcome close to payingforthe size ofthe taxcutthatRepublicanspropose. Alookatthe stockmarket, which soared asthe bill passed the Senate, showsthat mostbusinessescan expectto do well.The third diﬀerence between the bills istheircost. The reform of1986 wasrevenueneutral. Today’seﬀortwill cost$1.4trn inforgone revenue by2027, or$1trn, once itslikelyeﬀecton economicgrowth istakeninto account, accordingto an oﬃcial scoreofthe Senate’sbill.Forthatreason, the bettercomparisonisto Reagan’staxcutin 1981, which reallydoeshave a claim to be the biggestin post-warhistory. Thatbill, much like today’s,wassold on the basisthattaxcutspay forthemselves. Itcontained bigacross-the-board income-taxcuts, and investment in-centivesforbusinesses. Overitsﬁrst fouryears, itcosta mammoth 2.9% ofGDP—orrather, itwould have done, had lawmakersnotspentthe nextfewyearsreversing itinan attemptto getdeﬁcitsundercontrol. Be-tween 1982 and 1985 lawmakerspassed taxrisesworth 1.7% ofGDP, accordingto theTreasuryDepartment.Such an about-turn isveryunlikely onthisoccasion. Thatsaid, the Senate bill’sthe TaxFoundation, a right-leaningthink-tank, reckonsitmighthave reduced eco-nomicgrowth—a remarkable possibility,given the esteem in which itisheld.Second, the reform of1986 wasmoreegalitarian. Again, thisisnoteasyto spot.Reagan’sreform slashed the top rate of per-sonal income taxalmostin half, from 50%to 28%. Bymostaccounts, thiswasthenumberReagan cared aboutmost. Butalossofdeductions, and the rise in overallbusinessand capital gainstaxes, werecountervailingforces. And lowerearnersgotincome-taxcuts, too.

Whatisinitiallya taxcutfor mostlower- and middle-earnerswill turn into ataxincrease, because ofchangesto howtaxbracketswill be adjusted forinﬂation. Republicanslastpassed temporary taxcutsunderGeorge W. Bush in 2001and2003. Like the lawof1981, these contribut-ed to growingdeﬁcits. However, they werenotreversed. In 2013, underBarackObama,theywere mostlymade permanentbya bi-partisan deal, although taxeson top earn-erswentbackup. Itispossible that, come2025, Congresswill implementa similarextension ofthe Trump taxcuts. Ifit does,theirlong-term costswill be greater. Ifitdoesnot, the eﬀecton inequalityof today’sbill will be worse, because itsbusiness taxcutsare permanent.The taxbill could yetchange astheHouse and the Senate negotiate. Forexam-ple, one partoftoday’staxreform isits abo-lition ofthe deduction, from federally tax-able income, ofmoneyused to paystateand local income taxes. Republicanstriedand failed to eliminate thisdeduction in1986, butitwasspared bythe eﬀorts ofrep-resentativesofhigh-taxstatessuch as Cali-fornia and NewYork. Both the House andthe Senate billsscrap it(while keeping a de-duction forlocal propertytaxesin place).Republican representativesfrom Califor-nia are mountinga last-ditch attempt topreserve the deduction, up to a limit.“There’sa lotofthingsthatCaliforniansare workingon,” said Kevin McCarthy, theHouse majorityleader. In November, 11ofthe 14 House Republicansfrom Californiasupported the taxbill. Iftheyswitchedsides, theycould potentiallyblockit in theﬁnal vote.Thatremainsunlikely, because Repub-licansare desperate fora legislativeachievement. Butthe threatdemonstrateshowdiﬃcultitisto take awaytaxdeduc-tionsonce theyare granted. Reagan’sre-form managed itin partbecause ofbiparti-sanship: the bill wasintroduced in theHouse Ways& MeansCommittee byaDemocraticchairman, and ended up pass-ingthe Senate with 74 votes. IfRepublicanssucceed in passinga taxbill byChristmas,asMrTrump wants, and withoutanyDemocraticvotes, itwill atleastbe an actofimpressive political discipline. 7ALABAMAhasseldom been ofmuch in-terestto pollsters. No Democrathasheld statewide oﬃce since 2010, orbeenelected to the Senate since 1990.

Storiesaboutthe Republican candi-date forthe vacantAlabama senate seat,RoyMoore, and hispursuitofteenage girlswhen he wasmore than double theiragehave caused disgust, atleastamongthosewho believe the accusers. Legally, though,MrMoore could almostcertainlyhavemarried even his14-year-old accuserhadhe wished to do so, since atthe time 14 wasthe minimum age formarriage underAla-bama state law(itisnow16).America hasalwaysallowed such childmarriages, which happen mostlyin con-servative religiouscommunitiesand ruralareas. Yet, asin the restofthe world, thepractice hasbecome much lesscommon.Whereas23,500 minorsgotmarried in2000, by2010 the numberhad dropped toalittle over9,000, reﬂectingchangingso-cial norms, higherratesofschool atten-dance forgirlsand a decline in marriagemore generally. Virginia, Texasand NewYorkhave introduced lawsin the past cou-ple ofyearsthatrestrictmarriage to legaladults. Connecticuthasbanned marriagebefore the age of16. In 11otherstateslegisla-tion restrictingchild marriage isin thepipeline; sixofthese (Arizona, Florida,Maryland, Massachusetts, NewJerseyandPennsylvania) are consideringa lawto banmarriage under18 with no exceptions. Still, itremainsstartlingthatbetween2000 and 2015 more than 207,000 minorsgotmarried, accordingto an investigationbyFrontline, a publictelevision pro-gramme. More than two-thirdsofthemwere 17, but985 were only14 and ten werejust12. Human RightsWatch and otherac-tivistsare campaigningfora simple sol-ution forall states, which would end thepatchworkofrulesand loopholes: chang-ingthe age ofmarriage to 18, with no excep-tion granted. Jeanne Smootofthe TahirihJustice Centre, an advocacygroup, con-cedesthatthere isa bigdiﬀerence betweenagirl of14 and a girl of17, butshe pointsoutthatboth have similarlegal status. Neitherbride could stayin anykind ofshelter, forinstance, ifshe wanted to escape. And nei-thercould ﬁle fordivorce, worklegally orsign a rental lease.Surprisingly, opponentsofa ban onchild marriage can be found acrossthe po-litical spectrum. On the rightsome libertar-iansand religiousconservativesargue thatmarriage should be a choice made apartfrom the state; thatmarried minorscan re-duce the numberofsingle motherson wel-fare; and thatreligiouscustomsand prac-ticesneed to be protected. On the left, theAmerican Civil LibertiesUnion andPlanned Parenthood have also defendedthe practice in the pastbecause banning itwould intrude on the rightto marry.Despite these argumentsagainsta fed-eral law, the federal governmenthasbeenastaunch campaigneragainstchild bridesin the developingworld.

Editorslodged formal complaints atthe time, notleastbecause the snub camehoursafterMrTrump told cheeringconser-vative activiststhatthe “fake newsmedia”are “the enemyofthe people”. Buttherehave been manycommotionssince, andworse snubs.Yetthere are placeswhere thatkerfuﬄein a White House corridorlefta mark. TakeCambodia, the South-EastAsian countrywhose autocraticgovernmentchargedtwo ex-reportersin Novemberwith “espio-nage”, citingtheirpreviousworkforRadioFree Asia (RFA), a newsoutletfunded bythe American government. There isa di-rectconnection between the detention ofYeangSothearin and Uon Chhin, who faceup to 15 yearsin prison, and thatmomentofearlyTrumpian bombast. Hun Sen,Cambodia’sprime minister, pounced onthe humblingofreportersbythe WhiteHouse, declaringwith approval on Febru-ary27th thatMrTrump, like him, seesthepresscausing“anarchy”. The gloatingdidnotstop there. Denouncinga CNNreporton sextraﬃckingin Cambodia in August,MrHun Sen grumbled that“PresidentTrump isright: USmedia isverytricky.”Cambodian oﬃcialsexpelled the NationalDemocraticInstitute, a Washington-basedoutﬁtthatpromotesfree and fairelectionswith fundingfrom the American and otherWestern governments, and ordered radiostationsto stop carryingbroadcastsby RFAand the Voice ofAmerica.Escalatingthe ﬁght, the government ac-cused the main opposition partyofbeinginvolved in an American-backed plottooverthrowMrHun Sen, oﬀeringasevi-dence imagesofopposition activistsmeet-ingdiplomatsand SenatorJohn McCain ofArizona. Livid atbeingrebuked bytheAmerican embassyin Cambodia, MrHunSen tookhiscomplaintsto the top. Using asummitofAsian leadersin Manila on No-vember13th to praise MrTrump face-to-face, MrHun Sen called him “a greatper-son” wiselyuninterested in human rights.“I don’tknowifyouare like me, orI am likeyou,” he swooned. He had justone gripe.MrTrump should “admonish” diplomatsatthe American embassywho were work-ingagainsthis“greatprinciple” ofnon-in-terference in the politicsofforeign lands. Phnom-enalAsummitphotograph ofMrHun Sen withMrTrump, thumbs-up, beaming, washailed byCambodia’sformerforeign min-isterasproofthatitisbetterto “meetwiththe boss” than talkto “slaves”. Itwasa re-markable moment, and a misjudgment.MrHun Sen, alongwith otherdespotsandautocrats, sawa soulmate in an Americanpresidentwho campaigned byattackingthe free pressand the judiciary, who threat-ened to lockup hisopponentonce elected,who keptsecrethistaxreturns, who sug-gested thatthe presidential election mightbe rigged, and who scorned the idea thathiscountryisa democraticmodel, growl-ing: “The world seeshowbad the UnitedStatesis.” Thatled the Cambodian leaderto a gamble which, from outside the coun-try, seemshighlyconfusing: to tryto recruitAmerica’spresidentasan allyin a purgebuiltaround an anti-American conspiracytheory. Itfailed. On November16th theWhite House issued a statementexpress-ing“grave concern” afterCambodia’shigh-estcourtdissolved the main oppositionparty, declaringthatnextyear’selections,on currentcourse, “will notbe legitimate,free orfair” and warningof“concretesteps” in response.Cambodia’sstoryisinstructive. MrTrump hasﬂouted normsupheld—atleastin theory—byall modern holdersofhis of-ﬁce. He hasscorned the veryidea of Amer-ican exceptionalism, tellingArab and Mus-lim leadersin Riyadh in May: “America isasovereign nation and ourﬁrstpriority isal-waysthe safetyand securityofourciti-zens. We are nothere to lecture, we are nothere to tell otherpeople howto live.” Aforthcomingnational-securitystrategy issetto marka step backfrom global leader-ship, towardsa narrower, more zero-sumviewofAmerican interests. Nonetheless,some foreign rulerswho feltemboldenedto repressdomesticenemieswith impuni-tyhave been startled to ﬁnd thatno Trumpdoctrine reliablyprotectsthem.The Trump White House isfartoo cha-otic, riven byinﬁghtingand buﬀeted bytheimpulsesofthe president, to have cleardoctrinesaboutdemocracypromotion, ormanyotherweightyquestionsofgeopoli-tics, saysa senioradministration oﬃcial. Aposition mayearn signsofsupportfromMrTrump, but“youcan take thatto thebankforaslongasyouare talkingto him”,saysthe oﬃcial—before a presidentialtweetsaysthe opposite minuteslater. MrHun Sen’sblunder, the oﬃcial says, wastoprojecthisown absolutism onto America.“He seemsto thinkthatnowwe have thisrich old guyin charge ofthe United States,[MrTrump] can snap hisﬁngersand every-thingwill change.” American governmentismessierthan that. With a small countrylike Cambodia, policyremainsbroadly setbycareerforeign service oﬃcers(amongthem the American ambassador), bystaﬀin the National SecurityCouncil and bymembersofCongresssincerelyaggrievedbyMrHun Sen’sassaultson democracyand newsoutlets.

Itis“veryobvious”thatthe two leadersshare similarviews ondefendingtheircountriesfrom illegal im-migrants, a term which the ambassadorusesto coverthe vastmajorityofthosewho reached Europe duringthe refugee cri-sisof2015. Theyalso agree on the public’syearningforstrong, sovereign govern-mentsthatstand up fortheirnational inter-estswith whatMrSzabo callsa “healthyself-consciousness”. In April the Hungar-ian parliamentamended a higher-educa-tion lawin a waythatthreatened to closedown the Central European University(CEU), a graduate institute founded bytheHungarian-American billionaire, GeorgeSoros, a bogeyman to conservativesonboth sidesofthe Atlantic. In June Hungarypassed a lawrestrictingforeign funding forcivil-societygroups, again singlingout MrSoros, and triggeringlegal action by theEuropean Commission in Brussels, whichbelievesthe measure maybreach EUfun-damental rights. IfMrOrban expected tobe thanked bythe Trump administrationorRepublicansin Congressforthisassaulton MrSoros, he wasdisappointed.Abipartisan group ofsenators, led byChrisMurphyofConnecticut, told MrOr-ban thatthe lawagainstCEUthreatensaca-demicfreedoms. HungaryforgotthatCon-gresshasno desire to encourage despoticattackson the manyAmerican universitieswith branchesoverseas. The Trump-eraState Departmentcalled the lawon civil-societygroups“anotherstep away” fromHungarian commitmentsto the valuesofthe EUand ofNATO. In Octoberthe Ameri-can chargé d’aﬀaires, oractingambassadorto Hungary, David Kostelancik, delivered ablisteringspeech on pressfreedoms, decry-ingthe growingdominance of“pro-gov-ernmentﬁgures” overthe media, whoquash articlescritical ofthe government.Treadinga delicate path, MrKostelancikconceded that“Mypresidentisnotshyaboutcriticisingthe media when he be-lievesreportersgetitwrongorshow bias,”butnoted that“in the ﬁnesttraditionsofourfree press”, the targetsofMrTrump’swrath often pointoutthat“noteverycriti-cism ofthe governmentis‘fake news’.”Mostpointedly, MrKostelancikdeploredthe “dangerous” decision ofmedia outletslinked to the Hungarian governmenttopublish the namesofindividual journal-istsdeemed “threats” to the country.AformerRepublican congressmanwho nowworksasa lobbyistforthe Hun-garian government, Connie Mack, sup-ported a handful ofmembersofthe HouseofRepresentativesastheycomplainedaboutthe chargé d’aﬀairesto RexTillerson,the secretaryofstate. Still, MrTrump hasneithersided with MrOrban noryetwel-comed him to the Oval Oﬃce.

Rela-tionshave been sweetened with tensofbillionsofdollarsin American aid since1948, much ofitto buyweapons.EarlyexpectationsforTrump adminis-tration policywere nothigh. MrTrumppraised Mral-Sisi asa “fantasticguy” doinga“fantasticjob” undertryingcircum-stances, even asthe State Department waspreparinga formal memorandum to Con-gressaccusingEgyptian authoritiesof arbi-traryarrests, detentions, disappearancesand reported extrajudicial killings. But inan unprecedented move the State Depart-mentfroze nearly$100m in militaryandeconomicaid to Egypt, citinghuman-rightsconcerns, a move thata seniorﬁgure in theObama administration applaudsand calls“a signiﬁcantpiece ofpain to impose”. Sen-atorsofboth partiesapplied pressure tothe State Department, freezingsome aidforEgypton theirown initiative.MrTrump also secured the release ofAya Hijazi, an American dual nationaljailed on chargesforwhich the authoritiesoﬀered no seriousevidence, afterfoundingacharityto help streetchildren. Her storycaughtMrTrump’sattention—thisiscrazy,he told aides—and he proudlyinvited herto the White House afterherrelease. Thepresident, who isoften highlyinterested inwhetherhe, personally, will be given creditforan action, hassaid nothingin publicaboutthe other60,000 political prisonersthoughtto languish in Egyptian cells.AWhite House oﬃcial saysMrTrump’sEgyptpolicyisproofthatthe presidentdoesworkto promote human rights, de-spite hisunconventional rhetoric. The ap-proach ofPresidentGeorge W. Bush was“to verypubliclyendorse thisidea of push-ingdemocracyand freedom.

Butforeignautocratsare also learningthatAmerica’spresidentdoesnotrule alone. “The presi-dentmayscorn checksand balances,” saysthe oﬃcial, “butwe still have them.”7They froze how much?36UnitedStatesThe EconomistDecember9th2017AMID the spicyanecdotes, superﬁcial insights, sycophancy,score-settlingand casual loutishnessdisplayed in a newmemoirofDonald Trump’selection campaign, “LetTrump beTrump”, byCoreyLewandowski and David Bossie, the two es-sential characteristicsofTrumpland shine through. One isa per-manentstate ofconfusion, and sometimeschaos, attending acampaign thatinitiallydid no opinion polling, had no detailedpolicies, setitscommunicationsstrategybywhatevercrazy thingMrTrump had justmade up, wasmainlystaﬀed bypeople who“wouldn’tknowthe diﬀerence between a caucusand a cactus”,and whose top logistical prioritywasco-ordinatingthe tycoon’spost-rallyreturn to hisplane with the arrival ofa warm BigMac. Itfell to MrLewandowski, ascampaign manager, to perform thattask, which he considers“asimportantasanyotheraspectof [MrTrump’s] march to the presidency”. He had itlucky. The cam-paign’spresssecretary, Hope Hicks, who isnowthe White Housecommunicationsdirector, wascharged with steamingMrTrump’strousers, while he waswearingthem.The othercentral ingredientofTrump world ischutzpah on anepicscale. Alifetime ofcuttingcorners, a businessman’scon-temptforthe political realm and an insightthatvoters wouldwelcome hisboorishnessasstraight-shooting, encouraged MrTrump to transgresseverydemocraticnorm he encountered. Hispolicypronouncementswere nonsense and he lied all the time.Hisadviserswere complicitin this, eitherbecause they were en-raptured greenhornslike MrLewandowski: “OnlyDonaldTrump could getawaywith whathe gotawaywith,” he coos. Orbecause theywere MrTrump’schildren (one ofwhom had MrLe-wandowski frogmarched outofTrump Tower, afterconcludinghe wasno good) and doublycompromised, bya sense ofentitle-mentand ﬁlial deference to MrTrump.ForplayersofWashington’sfavourite parlourgame—predict-ingwhere RobertMueller’sinvestigation into alleged collusionbetween MrTrump’scampaign team and Russia mightend up—thiscombination ofrule-breakingand chaoslooksapposite. MrMuellerisgivingnothingaway. Yeteven before he revealed de-tailsofa plea deal with Mike Flynn, MrTrump’sﬁrstnational-se-curityadviser, he seemed to have somethingon the president.MrTrump haslambasted the investigation asa “witch-hunt”,hinted thathe mightshutitdown, asked Republican leaders toquash three related congressional probesand helped draft an er-roneousexplanation ofa meetingthathisson, son-in-law andothersenioradvisersheld with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyerwho isalleged to have oﬀered them dirton HillaryClinton. Thoseare notthe actionsofa blamelessman. Nor, especially in the lightofMrFlynn’splea deal, wasMrTrump’sattemptto warn JamesComey, histhen FBIdirector, oﬀpursuingMrFlynn oversomesurreptitiousconversationswith a Russian diplomat—and hisde-cision to sackhim when he demurred. Atthe same time, the chaosin MrTrump’steam suggeststhat itmighthave been incapable ofthe organised collusion with Rus-sian spiesmanyDemocratsare willingMrMuellerto uncover. Atthe least, itseemsthe feuding, amateurish Trump team wouldhave struggled to keep such a plotunderwraps. And the curioustermsofMrFlynn’splea deal mayalso pointto thatconclusion.The disgraced formermilitaryintelligence oﬃcerhasbeen ac-cused ofa lotofshadyactivitysince hissacking—including unreg-istered lobbyingactivityforthe Turkish government, a kidnap-pingplot, a plan to ﬂognuclearpowertechnologyaround theMiddle East, aswell aslyingto the FBI. AsMrTrump’smain for-eign-policyadviserduringthe campaign, with pro-Russia views,he mightadditionallybe expected to have known aboutwhatev-ercollusion wasafoot. Yethisplea deal mentionsonly the lies.Thatwould normallyimplyMrMuellerhad notbeen able tostand up anyofthe othercharges: prosecutorstend to crameverythingtheyhave into such deals, to showthe strength oftheirleverage and intimidate othertargets. Asthisdoes notseemto square with MrFlynn’sspicyrecord, orthe factthathe issaid tobe deeplydemoralised and almostbankrupted bylegal bills,manyhave assumed MrMuellerhasadditional acesup hissleeve, which he isconcealingto keep MrTrump and his advisersguessing. Maybe he has. Butthere isno obviousprosecutorialprecedentforthis. WithoutknowingwhatwrongdoingMrFlynnhasconfessed to, itismeanwhile impossible to surmise howmuch Russia-related trouble MrTrump isin.ObstructionschmuctionThere are perhapsthree waysthiscould playout. MrMuellercould end up exoneratingthe president. He could accuse himof—orconceivably, though legal expertsconsideritunlikely,charge him with—colludingwith Russian spies. Orhe could pro-vide evidence to suggesthe wasguiltyofthe arguablylesser, oratleastmore explicable in a blunderingpolitical amateur, oﬀenceofobstructingjustice byleaningon and sackingMrComey in abid to coverup the sordid, butnottreasonous, sortsof collusionbetween hisadvisersand Russiansthathave alreadycome tolight. Based on whatisnowknown, the third scenario seemsmostlikely. Itisalso in a sense the mosttroubling.Thatisbecause there isboth a clearhistorical precedent foroustinga presidenton the basisofobstruction, the charge thatdidforNixon, and atthe same time little prospectofa repeat perfor-mance. MrTrump will notstep aside asRichard Nixon did. Con-gress, though itmayimpeach him, lookstoo divided to removehim. The Republican Party, rallyingbehind a man campaigningforthe Senate in Alabama who isaccused ofmolestingteenagegirls, lookstoo morallycompromised and afraid forits future toturn on him. The resultwould be yetanotherTrump-sized excep-tion forbehaviourAmericansused to considerunconscionable.Thisiswhatitmeansto letTrump be Trump.7The limits ofthe lawAnewbooksuggests thatthe Trump campaign was too chaoticto pull oﬀa conspiracyLexingtonThe EconomistDecember9th201737FORa fewdays, Hondurasfeltlike acountryon the brinkofchaos.

On Decem-ber4th two elite police unitsdenounced“repression” bythe governmentand dis-obeyed ordersto enforce the curfew. The triggerforthe turmoil wasa generalelection held on November26th, and thedrawn-out, erraticvote countthatfol-lowed (see nextstory). With all the votestallied byDecember5th, Juan OrlandoHernándezappeared to win re-election asHonduras’spresident. The opposition re-fusesto acceptthat. “There isno longergo-ingto be democracyin Honduras,” thun-dered SalvadorNasralla (pictured above),asportsbroadcasterwho came surprising-lyclose to defeatingMrHernández. The opposition hasnotrelented, andsuspicionsoffraud have notdiminished.ButHondurasno longerfeelslike a countryaboutto spin outofcontrol. Thatis partlybecause the candidatesare startingto talk.

Theynational body, notthe country’selectoralcommission, to recountall the votes, notjustthe tallysheets. Failingthat, he wouldseeka run-oﬀelection between him andMrHernández, which the constitutiondoesnotprovide for. Some observersthinkthatwhatMrNasralla reallywantsis to re-turn to histelevision career. Manuel Ze-laya, who wasdeposed in the coup in 2009and backsMrNasralla, hasbeen more vis-ible than the candidate since the election.Even astheywrangle overthe terms ofarecount, there isspeculation thatthe twocandidatesare cookingup a private deal.MrHernándezwould remain president;the Alliance would refuse to recognise hisgovernmentbutwould notcall itssupport-ersonto the streets. In exchange, Mr Her-nándezwould oﬀerconcessionsincluding,perhaps, fresh electionsnextyearor a pro-mise to leave oﬃce afterhissecond term.Such a deal would notbe unprecedented.In 2015 MrZelaya condemned a decisionbythe pliantsupreme courtto allowMrHernándezto run forre-election butdidnotstage protestsagainstit.

Ifhe ﬁndsone, hewill be damaged butwill survive in oﬃce.Hondurans’ faith in democracywill behard to repair. 7could also resultin a shadydeal that islessaboutrespectingvoters’ wishesthanaboutcateringto the interestsofMr Her-nándezand MrNasralla. Adeal ofany sortwould probablycalm the streets. Failurecould whip them up again.Talks within talksOn theirface, the talksare abouthow to ar-rive atan accurate election result. Mr Her-nándezand MrNasralla have spentdayswith representativesofthe OrganisationofAmerican States(OAS), one ofthe for-eign groupsthatmonitored the elections.The United States, which hasbeen all butmute in public, hasalso been involved:John Creamer, a seniorState Departmentoﬃcial, joined the conversationsin Teguci-galpa, Honduras’scapital. The mediatorsare tryingto brokeran agreementon termsfora vote recount. In a preliminaryreporton the election, the OAShad called fora re-countofaround 5,000 ofthe 18,000 tallysheets, which record vote totalsfromacrossHonduras. These are the sheetswhose resultswere reported afteran inter-ruption in vote counting, with MrNasrallain the lead, on November27th. The OASbacksa demand bythe Alliance, MrNas-ralla’scoalition, fora full vote recount inthree stateswhere turnoutwasabnormal-lyhigh and foran extension ofthe dead-line to appeal the result. MrHernándezhasagreed to all this. Hisrival hasso farrefused.

He beatSalva-dorNasralla, a sportsbroadcaster, by42.98% to 41.38%. MrNasralla chargesthatthe result isfraudulent. Aweird and chaoticvote-countingprocesshasstrengthened thatsuspicion. Afterreleasingpreliminary re-sultsfrom 57% ofballotboxes, whichshowed MrNasralla with a lead ofﬁve per-centage points, the TSEstopped reportingon November27th withoutexplanation.Afterpublication ofresultsresumed on theafternoon ofNovember28th, MrNas-ralla’slead disappeared. Thatlooksﬁshy. The Economist hasanalysed the resultsto ﬁgure outwhethersomeone falsiﬁed thecount. Ourﬁndingsare notconclusive, buttheysuggestthere are reasonsto worry.Ifthe resultsreleased bythe TSEateachstage ofthe countwere a representativesample ofthe country, the oddsofthe shiftitreported from MrNasralla in early resultsto MrHernándezin lateroneswould beclose to zero. MrHernándezhasexplainedhisluckbysayingthatthe laterballotscome from rural areas, where hisNationalPartyisstronger.To testthistheory, The Economist com-pared resultsreported from municipalitiesbythe afternoon ofNovember28th with ﬁ-nal resultsfrom the same areas. Hondurasisdivided into 298 municipalities; 288 hadpublished incomplete resultsbefore re-portingwasinterrupted. We looked at mu-nicipalitiesbecause theyare small, andtend to be mainlyurban ormainlyrural. Even controllingforthat, the vote countshifted systematicallyfrom MrNasralla toMrHernándezbetween earlyand laterre-sults. In chartone, each dotrepresents amunicipality. The chartshowsforexamplethatMrHernándezgot36% ofthe votesinLa Libertad, in central Honduras, beforethe TSEstopped publishingresults. After itresumed, MrHernándezgot49% in thesame place. MrNasralla’sshare droppedfrom 51% to 36%. Ouranalysisshowsthathe lost3.5 pointson average relative to MrHernándezwithin each municipality.Provingfraud through such analysis isdiﬃcult. Statistical anomaliescan havereasonable explanations. One possible ob-jection, even though municipalitiesare ingeneral fairlyhomogeneous, could be thatthose in which MrHernándezoutper-formed have a large numberofvotersliv-ingin urban areasthatreported early andmanylivingin late-reportingrural areas.We asked RosemaryJoyce, an anthro-pologistatthe UniversityofCalifornia,Berkeleywho specialisesin Honduras, tosee ifthatwasthe case. She found that ex-planation forthe vote shiftimplausible:municipalitiesin the departmentsofLaPazand Lempira, where MrHernándezim-proved signiﬁcantlybetween earlyandlate counting, do nothave large towns.MsJoyce’sclaim issupported byouranalysisofcensusdata from 2013. Welooked atthe splitbetween rural and ur-ban householdsin the 284 municipalitiesforwhich data are available, aswell astheproportion ofhouseswith dirtﬂoors,which correlatescloselywith the share ofrural households. We found no relation-ship between howrural a municipalitywasand howsharplyitsvote shifted to-wardsMrHernández(see chart2). Anotherpossible objection to our ana-lysisisthatthe earlyreportswere based onvote talliesthatwere sentelectronically tothe TSE; 29% ofvote tallieswere not, ac-cordingto monitorsfrom the EU. Theremightbe a reason whyelectronicallytrans-mitted voteswould favourMrNasralla.Butthe diﬀerence would have to be huge toexplain the shiftin the latercountto MrHernández. Ifvotessentelectronically fa-vourMrNasralla byﬁve percentage points,he would have had to lose byover18 pointsamongvotesreported on paperto explainthe late shifttowardsthe president.

Thatisto misread the man. In his de-cade in powerRaúl hasstriven above allto institutionalise the Cuban communistregime, replacingthe wayward charismaofFidel with orderlyadministration and acollective leadership. He hasgroomed ashissuccessorMiguel Díaz-Canel, a 57-year-old engineerwho hasalreadyas-sumed manypublicduties. Yet, aspresi-dent, MrDíaz-Canel’sautonomywill belimited. He isjustone ofa group of partybureaucratsand generalswho are the realpowerin Cuba, steadilyreplacingthe gen-eración histórica(those who foughtin the1959 revolution), who are dyingoﬀ.The newgeneration facesan acute di-lemma. Despite aid from Venezuela,which hasnowfallen to halfitspeak level,Cuba remainsunable to produce much ofthe food itconsumesorpayitspeoplemore than miserable wages. ThatiswhyRaúl embraced marketreforms, albeitfarmore timid onesthan those in China orVietnam. More than 500,000 Cubansnowworkin an incipientprivate sectorof smalland micro businessesorco-operatives. Butthese reformsbringinequality andalossofstate control. When MrObamavisited Cuba in 2016, oﬀeringsupportforentrepreneursand callingon live televi-sion forfree elections, the regime appearedto panic. Since then, the governmenthasplaced some curbson small businesstostop whatRaúl called “illegalitiesand oth-ertransgressions”. In otherwords, the gov-ernmentwantsa marketeconomywith-outcapitalistsorbusinessesthatthrive andgrow. Itseemsnowhere neartacklingthemultiple exchange rates(rangingfrom onepeso to the dollarforoﬃcial imports to 25formostwagesand prices) thatludicrouslydistortthe economy. Stallingmayleave intactthe regime’spolitical control—itsoverridingpriority.Butthisignoresa fundamental problem.Since the 1980sthe Cuban economyhassteadilylostground in relation to those ofotherLatin American countries, asastudypublished lastmonth bythe Inter-American DevelopmentBankshows. Itsauthor, Pavel Vidal, wasone ofRaúl’steam ofreformisteconomicadvisers andisnowatthe Javeriana Universityin Cali,Colombia. He hasdevised hitherto un-available internationallycomparable es-timatesforCuba’sGDPsince 1970 bycal-culatingan average exchange rate whichtakesinto accountthe weightofthe va-riousratesin the economy.MrVidal ﬁndsthatGDPperperson inCuba in 2014 wasjust$3,016 atthe averageexchange rate, barelyhalfthe oﬃcially re-ported ﬁgure and onlya third ofthe LatinAmerican average. Thisincludesthe val-ue offree social services(such as health,education and housing) thatCubansre-ceive. Takinginto accountpurchasingpower, GDPperperson was$6,205 in2014, or35% belowitslevel of1985. MrVi-dal goeson to compare Cuba with tenotherLatin American countrieswhosepopulationsare similarin size. Whereasin 1970 Cuba wasthe second-richest, be-hind onlyUruguay, in 2011(the latestyearforwhich data are available) itwas insixth place in income perperson, havingbeen overtaken byPanama, Costa Rica,the Dominican Republicand Ecuador.Cuba’sdecline isabove all because oflackofinvestment, saysMrVidal. But ashrinkingand ageingpopulation plays apart, too. He ﬁndsthatthe reforms havebroughtabouta modestincrease in in-come and even in productivity. They “goin the rightdirection buthave fallenshort”, he concludes. ForMrDíaz-Canel and hisreformistcolleaguesthe message isclear: speedingup change carriespolitical risks, but notdoingso involveseconomicones. AyearwithoutFidelBelloCuba’s leaders are trapped between the need forchange and the fearofitMrTrudeauisnotthe ﬁrstCanadianleaderto deal with disappointmentsintradingrelationshipsbyseekingoutnewones. When Britain removed preferentialtreatmentforexportsfrom coloniesin 1846,Canada soughta deal with the UnitedStates. MrTrudeau’sfather, Pierre Trudeau,who wasprime ministeron and oﬀfromthe 1960sto the 1980s, pursued a “third op-tion” to supplementtrade with the UnitedStates, which had raised tariﬀs, and Britain,which had entered Europe’scommon mar-ket. Canada ended up doublingdown ontrade with the United States. Abilateraltrade agreement, which tookeﬀectin 1989,wassuperseded byNAFTA. Lastyearthe United Statesboughtthree-quartersofCanada’sgoodsexports.Itwill remain Canada’smain tradingpartner, admitsFrançois-Philippe Cham-pagne, Canada’strade minister. But, with“the mostprotectionistgovernmentsincethe 1930s” in Washington, “there hasneverbeen a bettertime to diversify.”Changesin Canada’seconomymakethatmore urgent. Thingslookgood for themoment: GDPisexpected to growby3%thisyearand unemploymentis5.9%, nearaten-yearlow. Butoil and cars, which havesustained growth formore than a decade,face hardertimes. MrTrump isusingpro-tectionistthreatsto grab jobsand invest-mentbackfrom Canada and Mexico. Al-berta’soil, which iscostlyto produce, facesgrowingcompetition from gasand renew-able energy. The industriesofthe futureprobablyinclude food, hydro-electricityand artiﬁcial intelligence, butnone match-esthe importance ofcarsand oil.Freertrade would help. ButMrTrudeauﬁndshimselfchasingdealswith bigcoun-trieslike China, which rejectlabour andenvironmental add-onsthatwould makesuch pactsacceptable to Canadians. Hemayremain a disappointed suitor. 7The EconomistDecember9th201741For daily analysis and debate on the Middle Eastand Africa, visitEconomist.com/world/middle-east-africa EVENbefore Donald Trump issued hisproclamation recognisingJerusalem asthe capital ofIsrael, stiﬀopposition wasbrewing. Pope Francisand the SupremeLeaderofIran denounced hisplan to moveAmerica’sembassyfrom Tel Avivto Jeru-salem. So did the UNSecretary-General,the prime ministerofItalyand a globalchorusofdiplomats. Ifanything, opposi-tion from such grandeesemboldened MrTrump. On December6th he jettisonedmostofthe conventional wisdom aboutthe Israeli-Palestinian peace process.Withoutpreconditions, MrTrump re-cognised Jerusalem asthe historiccapitalofthe Jewish people, “established in an-cienttimes”, and theseatofIsrael’sgovern-ment. In the ﬁrsttaste ofa peace plan he isexpected to unveil nextyear, he failed tomention Jewish settlementsin the WestBankorthe Palestinians’ claimsto Jerusa-lem. Itwas, ashe said, “veryfresh think-ing”. The proclamation delighted Israel’sprime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu,who hailed itas“a historicday” forwhichIsrael is“profoundlygrateful”. Since David Ben Gurion moved hisgov-ernmentto Jerusalem in 1949, Israel hasbeen the onlycountrywith a capital that isnotformallyrecognised bythe restof theworld. The cityisstill considered by the UNacorpusseparatum—a separate entityun-derinternational jurisdiction. On theground thishasneverbeen the case. Untilcitizensand cannotvote in national elec-tions. Theirstatusremainsto be resolved.MrTrump hasbased much ofhisMid-dle Eastpolicyon buildinga closeralliancewith Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, alongwithAmerica’sotherArab allies,publiclyop-posed the recognition ofJerusalem. But itisunlikelythatMrTrump would have goneahead iftheyhad notprivatelyassuredhim thattheyhad biggerthingsto worryabout. The Sunni Arab statesare less con-cerned aboutPalestine than aboutIran’sgrowinginﬂuence, and ﬁndingwaystocontain it(see page 43). Israel, behind thescenes, hasbecome a tacitallyofthe Sau-disin the Sunni-Shia conﬂict.Holycity, unholymessThisleavesthe Palestiniansisolated, a sen-timentpalpable on the streetsofEast Jeru-salem thisweek.

Nowthe callsfromwithin the Palestinian national movementfora return to intifada, ie, a violentupris-ing, are growing. However, manyPalestiniansremainwearyofconﬂictwith the Israelis. “Whyshould we startanotherintifada and loseoursons?” asked Fowzi Iyad, a traderfromJerusalem’sMuslim Quarter. “JustbecauseTrump said he’sgoingto build an embas-sy? Let’ssee Trump buildingsomething.

Saeb Erekat, secretary-general of thePalestine Liberation Organisation, and pre-viouslythe Palestinians’ chiefnegotiatorwith Israel, said thatMrTrump had “dis-qualiﬁed hiscountryfrom anypossiblerole in the peace process”. ButMrTrumpinsistedthathe still intendsto honour hisearlierpromise to achieve the “ultimatedeal”—peace between Israel and the Pales-tinians. He stressed: “we are nottakingaposition on anyﬁnal statusissues, includ-ingthe speciﬁcboundariesofthe Israelisovereigntyin Jerusalem, orthe resolutionofcontested borders.” Butitwill be hardfrom thispointto getthe Palestinians to re-turn to the negotiationsthattheyaban-doned three yearsago. The move ofthe embassycould in the-orybe stalled bya future president, thoughthatisunlikely. Meanwhile, protests areerupting. The Palestiniansstill insist thatpartofJerusalem should serve asthe capi-tal ofa future Palestinian state, as a condi-tion ofanypeace deal.

Butfordecadesafter inde-pendence the authoritiesleftmostArabsisolated in ill-funded villagesand townswithouttransportto the country’seco-nomichubs. Asof2015, 53% ofArabswerepoor, against14% ofJews.

Forall hismanyfaults, MrSaleh wasthe mostpower-ful politician in Yemen, and both Americaand Saudi Arabia had hoped to use him tobrokeran end to the war. Hisdeath leaves apowervacuum thatno one else will beable to ﬁll anytime soon.MrSaleh ran Yemen (before 1994, NorthYemen) for33 years. Buthe failed to give agrowingpopulation the necessaryinvest-mentsin health care and education. In-stead he and hisallieswere accused ofplunderingbillionsfrom the Arab world’spooreststate. MrSaleh faced massprotestsduringthe Arab spring, and survived an as-sassination attempt.

Afterservingasgovernorof theOdessa region, MrSaakashvili turnedagainstPetro Poroshenko, Ukraine’spresi-dent, who responded bystrippinghim ofhisUkrainian citizenship while he wasabroad. (He had alreadylosthisGeorgiancitizenship.) Bundled through a borderpostbyhissupporters, the stateless MrSaakashvili deﬁantlyre-entered the coun-tryand, on December3rd, staged a rallycallingforMrPoroshenko’simpeachment. Two dayslaterUkraine’ssecurityser-vicescame to arresthim. MrSaakashviliclimbed to the top ofan eight-storey build-ingand rallied hissupportersfrom theroof. When agentsgrabbed him, the crowdblocked theirvan and freed him.

Mr Pu-tin mustbe enjoyingthe show.7THIRTYyearsago, Ronald Reagan andMikhail Gorbachevsigned the Inter-mediate-Range NuclearForces(INF) treaty,banishingan entire categoryofdestabilis-ingweaponsfrom Europe. Some 2,700ground-launched ballisticand cruise mis-sileswith rangesbetween 500 and 5,500km were destroyed in a deal thatpresagedthe end ofthe cold war. Yettodaythe treatyisimperiled byRussian violations. If thosedo notcause itto collapse, the responseAmerica iscontemplatingmay. America ﬁrstannounced itsconcernsoverRussian violationsin 2014, a fewmonthsafterVladimirPutin annexed Cri-mea. The treatyobligesboth countries notto possess, “produce orﬂight-test” newin-termediate-range ground-launched mis-siles. Russia, the Americanssaid, had test-ed a cruise missile thatbreached thatagreement. No countermeasureswere pro-posed, apparentlyin the hope thatthe Rus-sianswould be embarrassed into quietlyabandoningthe newsystem. The Russiansdenied the charge, thoughtheyhad been complainingaboutthetreatyforyears, sayingitblocked themfrom deterringnewmissile powers. (Chi-na, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel,theynoted, all have intermediate-rangemissiles.) Anotherreason whyAmericahesitated to retaliate wasthatitwas fo-cused on deployingnewtroopsto NATO’seastern members, who were worried byRussia’sintervention in Ukraine. Thethreatto the treatywasseen asa slow-burnproblem thatcould be addressed later. Thattime appearsto have come. In Feb-ruaryDonald Trump’sadministration re-vealed thatRussia had secretlybegun de-ployingthe newmissile, known astheSSC-8, a ground-launched variantofthe3M14 naval cruise missile used on targets inSyria two yearsago. The SSC-8 can bemoved byroad and hasa range of2,500km. The Russianshave two operationalbattalions, each with about36 missiles.One isthoughtstill to be atthe KapustinYartestsite nearVolgograd, the other atabase in the central militarydistrict thatputsitin range oftargetsacrossEurope.The Trump administration isexpectedto publish itsNuclearPosture Review earlynextyear, which will guide itsnuclearweaponspolicy. Oﬃcialsare seekingwaysto bringRussia backinto compliance withthe treatyratherthan walkingawayfromit. Butsome in the administration are scep-tical aboutall arms-control agreements,and the INFtreatyin particular. LastmonthCongressauthorised the Pentagon tospend $58m on a response. The plan in-cludesinitial developmentofa newAmer-ican intermediate-range missile. Thatwould notbreach the treaty, butmostarms-control expertsregard itasa step inthe wrongdirection. Producingsuch a mis-sile would take manyyearsand costbil-lionsofdollarsthatthe Pentagon can ill af-ford. The eﬀortto persuade EuropeanmembersofNATOto hostthe missileswould divide the alliance, and the Rus-sianscould claim thatnotthey, buttheAmericans, had blown up the treaty. Steven Pifer, a formerarms-control ne-gotiatoratthe BrookingsInstitution, athink-tank, saysthatitmakesno sense togive MrPutin exactlywhathe wants. Hereckonsthere are betterwaysto putpres-sure on Russia. One would be deployingexistingair- and sea-launched cruise mis-silesto Europe and nearbywaters. B-1stra-tegicbombersarmed with stand-oﬀmis-silescould be stationed atFairford, anAmerican base in Britain. Submarinescar-ryingcruise missilesmightturn up on pa-trol in the North Sea. MrPiferalso thinks itishigh time thatAmerica’sEuropean allies,in particularFrance and Germany, criti-cised the Kremlin’sbehaviour, which is athreatnotjustto the treatybutto them.Itmaybe too late to save the INF treaty,butitisworth an eﬀort. Ifthe treaty dies,the prospectsforextendingthe NewSTARTstrategicweaponsdeal, which will other-wise expire in 2021, will be dim. So will thefuture ofnuclear-armscontrol itself. 7Arms control in EuropeAtreatyin perilThe unravelling ofthe INFtreatyundermines a symbol ofdétenteKapustin YarKaliningradSelikhinoIrkutskPACIFICOCEANATLANTICOCEANARCTIC OCEANMoscowBeijingCrimeaCHINARUSSIAFRANCEGERMANYISRAELSYRIAUKRAINEBRITAINUNITEDSTATESN.

Thatisa much more gener-oussettlementthan some othercentralgovernmentdepartmentshave beenawarded (see chart).Butitdoesnottell the full story. Themostrecentdefence review, in 2015, wasambitiousboth in itsgoalsforspending onnewkitand in ﬁndingthe savingsto helppayforit. Abigchunkofthose savings wasto come from eﬃciencygains. Unsurpris-ingly, notall ofthose hoped-foreﬃciencieslooklikelyto be realised. Malcolm Chal-mersofthe Royal United ServicesInstitute,adefence and securitythink-tank, pointsoutthat, forexample, the 30% savingon thecivilian workforce thatthe Ministryof De-fence haspencilled in can be fullyachieved onlythrough outsourcing, whichmaybe cheaperbutwhich still hasto bepaid for. Furtherpressureson the defence bud-getare comingfrom all sides. The pound’sdepreciation since the Brexitreferendumhasadded to the £178bn bill earmarked forequipmentoverten years, 12% ofwhich isto be paid in dollarsoreuros. The cost ofthe programme to replace Britain’sageingballistic-missile submarineshascrept upto £31bn, with another£10bn putaside for“contingencies”. Evermore moneymustbe found foradvanced cyber-capabilities.Previousassumptionsabouta prolongedfreeze on forces’ payare almostcertain toprove untenable asotherpublicsectorworkerssecure payincreases.The resultisthatthe Ministryof De-fence isdesperatelyseekingwaysto ﬁndsavingsofaround £2bn a year, atleast until2022 and probablyforﬁve yearsafter that.Exactlyhowthe axe will fall islikely to bedetermined bya reviewof“national-secu-ritycapabilities” thatisexpected to reportearlynextyear—a delaysupposedlyto al-lowthe recentlyappointed defence secre-tary, Gavin Williamson, time to geta gripon hisnewbrief. There are alreadysome indications ofthe waythingsare going. The navy, says MrChalmers, hasmade clearthatitsprioritiesare the nucleardeterrent, aircraft-carrierstrike capacity(two newcarriersare in theprocessofenteringservice), and the attacksubmarine force. The resultisthatBritain’samphibiouscapabilitiesare expected totake the hit, with two assaultshipstakenoutofservice and the numberofRoyal Ma-rinescutby15%.The armyisalso likelyto suﬀer. The gov-ernmenthad promised notto go lowerthan 82,000 soldiers, butthe current ﬁgureisaround 77,400 and there are fearsthat itcould go aslowas60,000. American gen-eralsare worried thatBritain would behard putto deploya division (about20,000 troops) alongside theirforces in afuture European war. The House ofCom-monsdefence committee warned earlierthisyearthat, even atthe previousnum-bers, the “credibilityofthe warﬁghting di-vision will be undermined”. MrChalmersthinksan expedientfudge on armysizecould be found, butthere maybe a price tobe paid in termsofurgentlyneeded newarmoured vehicles.Fouryearsago the then-chiefofthe de-fence staﬀ, General SirNickHoughton,sounded the alarm aboutmanpowercutsresultingin a “hollowforce”.

Today,asthe information revolution gatherspace, Britain suﬀers fromthe same problem. The countryismore divided than ithas beenfordecades, with the rich consolidatingtheirpowerand peoplewho are born in the wrongclassorregion seeingtheirchances ofgettingahead declining. Theresa Mayrightlyputdealing withthisproblem atthe top ofheragenda when she became primeminister. Buton December3rd all fourmembersofBritain’sSo-cial MobilityCommission resigned in protestatthe lack ofpro-gress. Thiswasone ofthe lowestpointsfora government thathasno shortage oflowpointsto choose from.Social mobilityisessential to the workingofan advanced cap-italistsociety. Forone thing, citizenswill acceptthe inequalitiesthatcapitalism generatesonlyiftheythinktheyhave a fairchance ofgettingahead. The notion thatthe system isrigged canbe justasdestabilisingaseconomiccrises. Secondly, advancedeconomiescan growonlyiftheymake a reasonable job of dis-coveringthe hidden Einsteinswho mightbe able to produce thenextgreatinvention iftheywere given the chance.Britain isfailingbadlyon both fronts. Itsdecision to leave theEuropean Union wasabove all a revoltofthe left-behind. The So-cial MobilityCommission discovered that62 ofthe 65 partsofthecountrythatitidentiﬁed as“social-mobilitycold spots”—thatis,those with the worsteducation and employmentprospects—vot-ed to leave. AnewpaperbyRaj Chetty, ofStanford University,and colleagues, arguesthatAmerican growth isbeinghinderedbythe missing-Einstein problem because educational opportuni-tyisincreasinglyrestricted byclassorregion. Thatproblem isasbad, ifnotworse, in Britain.Associal mobilityhasbecome more importantithasbecomemore diﬃcultto promote. The reason forthisisthe paradox ofmeritocracy. In the ﬁrsthalfofthe 20th century, when the old es-tablishmentruled the country, openingup opportunities wasrel-ativelysimple. Youforced the establishmentto abandon obviousprejudices, such asthe factthatthe bestOxbridge colleges werereserved formen. Youalso forced itto build a ladderof opportu-nityforthe poor: the 1944 Education Actraised the school-leavingage to 15, then 16, and the expansion ofuniversitiesin the 1960sde-mocratised highereducation. Todayopeningup opportunities ismuch more diﬃcult, preciselybecause the meritocratic revolu-tion hasbeen so successful.The meritocraticelite hasproved remarkablygood athoard-ingopportunities. Successful people tend to marryeach other.Couplesdevote themselvesto givingtheirchildren the best educ-tion possible, startingin the nursery. Private schoolshave alsoproved to be more successful than state schoolsatadapting to themeritocraticspirit. Institutionsthatonce turned outﬂannelledfoolsand muddied oafsare nowobsessed with exam results. To make mattersworse, the knowledge economyisa winner-takes-mosteconomy. Superstarﬁrmsare pullingahead of run-of-the-mill ones. Superstarcitiesare pullingahead ofsecond-tierones. Thisproblem ismore pronounced in Britain than almostanywhere else because London isso dominant. The London ef-fectisobviouslygood forLondon-based professionalswho canprovide theirchildren with bed and board astheygettheir feetonthe careerladder(often asunpaid interns). Butitisalso good forpoorerpeople who are luckyenough to have subsidised accom-modation within the sound ofBowBells. London’sstate schoolsare betterthan the national average, jobsare plentiful and youcan getalmostanywhere, ata squeeze, bypublictransport. The resultisa calciﬁed society. Seventy-one percent ofseniorjudges, 62% ofsenioroﬃcersin the armed forcesand 55% ofcivilservice departmentheadsattended private schools, which edu-cate only7% ofthe population. In Barnsleyonly10% ofdisadvan-taged youngpeople make itto university, compared with 50% ofsimilarlydisadvantaged youngstersin Kensington and Chelsea.Only6% ofdoctors, 12% ofchiefexecutivesand 12% ofjournalistscome from working-classbackgrounds.Going upReversingthiscalciﬁcation will take a lotofinnovative thinking.The Social MobilityCommission produced a seriesofexcellentreportswhich suggested sensible solutionssuch asbetter earlyeducation fordisadvantaged children. Thiscolumnistwould sup-porta combination ofreachinginto Britain’spastand peeringinto itsfuture. Britain hasa distinguished historyof elite institu-tionsdoingtheirbitformobility: Oxbridge collegescreating feed-erschools, and private schoolssettingaside placesfor poorschol-ars. Given thatso manyprivate schoolshave forgotten theirsocial obligationsin theirzeal to fatten theircoﬀers with feesfromrich Russiansand Chinese, itistime to remind them that theyneed to earn theircharitable status. Meanwhile, the very technol-ogythatiswideningclassdivisionscan also be used to closethem. The Israel Defence Forcesrespond to the lost-Einstein pro-blem bymonitoringchildren’sperformance in video games, aswell asmore routine academictests.ButBritain’stwo main partiesare failingto give this growingproblem the energyitrequires. The Conservativesare over-whelmed byBrexit. Labourisdevotingitsintellectual resources,in so farasitstill hasany, to the old problem ofa closed establish-mentratherthan the newproblem ofthe marriage ofmeritocra-cyand plutocracy. Thanksto itscommitmentto intelligent re-form, Disraeli’sBritain became the mostpeaceful, aswell asthemostsuccessful, countryin Europe.

That isthanksto an ever-growinghabitamongEnglish Muslim couples: havingan Islamicceremonywhich isnotregistered with theBritish state. Arecentsurveyof1,000 mar-ried Muslim women byBritain’sChannel4, a publiclyowned broadcaster, foundthat600 had religious-onlyunions.Onlya fewimamsin England are li-censed asstate registrars. In England, iftherelationship breaksdown, the ﬁnanciallyweakerpartner, usuallythe woman, ispoorlyplaced to claim maintenance or ashare ofassets. (Thisisrarelyan issue inScotland, where manyimamsare regis-tered ascelebrants.) “Iftheyhad marriedIslamicallybackin Pakistan, thatwouldhave standing,” saysAina Khan, a lawyerand activist.

Thatobstaclewasremoved in 2011when the SupremeCourtin British Columbia found freedomofreligion could notbe used to justify ac-tionsthatharmed others.The debate aboutthe conﬂictingprinci-plesofhuman rightsand religiousfreedomisshiftingto Islamicimmigrants. That ispartlybecause ofthe trial ofMohammadShaﬁa, an Afghan immigrantwho in 2009,with the help ofhissecond wife and son,murdered three oftheirotherchildren, aswell ashisﬁrstwife; and partlybecause ofthe passage in 2015 ofthe Zero Tolerance forBarbaricCultural PracticesActbythe pre-viousConservative government. The law,which reiterated thatpolygamyisa crime,asare “barbaricpractices” such asgenitalmutilation and the forced marriage of chil-dren, wascriticised forhavingan Islamo-phobictone. Yetitstrucka chord withthose Canadianswho feel Muslimsdo notshare theirvalues. Polygamyislegal forMuslimsin threeofthe top ﬁve source countriesforimmi-grantsto Canada in 2015 (the Philippines,Iran and Pakistan) and quite common inanother(India). Canada hasadvisedUNHCR, the UN’sagencyforrefugees, notto referanyrefugeesin polygamousmar-riagesto Canada forresettlement.

Susan Drummond, a legal an-thropologist, argued in 2009 thatthe banon polygamyshould be dropped becauseCanada hasotherlawsand regulations toprotectwomen and minors.

In practice, theirrulings inMuslim marital mattersusuallyfavourwomen, saysEefje de Kroon, a Dutch hu-man-rightscampaigner. Forthe 800,000 orso MuslimsofBel-gium, manyofwhom oscillate betweenthere and Morocco, marryingisan obstaclecourse. In Belgium onlycivil marriages arevalid. Butthe Moroccan state recognisesonlyIslamicprocedures, eitherin Moroccoorone ofitsconsulates. Withouta religiousmarriage a couple cannotdispose ofprop-ertyoreven share a bedroom in Morocco.Meanwhile, Belgian-Moroccansoften feelthe need to have a religiousrite in Belgium,even though ithasno legal statusany-where. Manycouplesdo all three. Simplycohabitingisnotan acceptable option, anymore than itisforyoungMuslim couplesgrowingup in eastLondon orMarseille. Yacob Mahi, one ofBelgium’sbest-known imams, sayshe triesto limitharmbyrefusingto conducta religiouscere-monyunlessthe couple hasalreadyunder-gone a civil procedure. He also tries to as-certain ifthe marriage isabusive or forced.Yetdespite the eﬀortsofvigilantimams,people game the system. Forexample, aBelgian-Moroccan man can use a religiousrite in Brusselsto dignifya bigamous mar-riage which would be banned even in Mo-rocco (unlessthe ﬁrstwife had consented).Spain isa rare European countrywheremarriage in a mosque (orsynagogue orchurch) enjoysstate recognition. Germanyused to insiston civil marriage forall cou-plesbefore anyspiritual rites. Butfrom2009 ithasallowed religious-onlymar-riages, in deference to newcomersfromMuslim countriesand Israel, anotherlandwhere onlyreligiousnuptialscount.

ButIBM’sweaknessesmaynotholditback. Bossesofmostbusinessesfeel pres-sure to have an AIstrategy, and theywillpayhandsomelyto acquire one quickly.To date tech giantshave mostlytried toapplyAIto reap proﬁtsfrom theirexistingoperations. In the nextfewyearsthey hopethatAIwill letthem build newbusinesses.One area ofintense competition isvirtualassistants. Smartphonesknowtheirusersintimately, butAI-powered virtual assis-tantsaim to take the relationship further,whetherthrough phonesorsmartspeak-ers. Apple wasﬁrstto explore their promisewhen itboughtSiri, a voice assistant, in2010. Since then Amazon, Google and Mi-crosofthave invested heavily: theirassis-tants’ speech recognition isbetteras a re-sult. Samsung, Facebookand Baiduarealso competingto oﬀerthem. One algorithm to rule them allItisunclearwhetherstandalone speakerswill become a huge market, butitiscertainthatpeople will move beyond textto en-gage with the internet. “All these compa-niesunderstand thatwhoeverownsthatchoke pointforconsumerswill rule themarket,” saysPedro Domingos, authorof“The MasterAlgorithm”, a bookaboutAI. Furtherinto the future, augmented-re-ality(AR) devicesare anotherAI-infusedopportunity. Mobile appslike Snap, a mes-sagingapp, and the game Pokémon Go areearlyexamplesofAR. ButARcould moreradicallytransform people’srelationshipwith the internet, so thattheyconsumedigital information notfrom a small screenbutvia an ambient, ever-presentexperi-ence. ARdeviceswill oﬀerportable AIca-pabilities, such assimultaneoustransla-tion and facial recognition.In the race forAR, bigtech ﬁrmshavenotgotmuch beyond the warm-up phase.Google and Apple have launched ARsoft-ware-developmentkits; theyboth wantdevelopersto build appsthatuse ARontheirplatforms. There isalso a rush to de-velop ARhardware. Google wasearlytolaunch a prototype forARglasses, buttheyﬂopped. Microsofthasdeveloped a head-setitcallsHoloLens, butwith a price ofbe-tween $3,000-5,000, itisa niche product.Otherﬁrms, includingFacebookand Ap-ple, are thoughtto be planningtheir ownoﬀerings. Beingahead in AIcould translateinto bigleadsin these newﬁelds. Nowhere isthattruerthan in the realmofautonomousvehicles. Tech ﬁrmsaredrivingmillionsofmilesto build up big,proprietarydatasets, and are makinguseofcomputervision to train theirsystems torecognise objectsin the real world. The po-tential spoilsare huge. Personal transporta-tion isa vastmarket, worth around $10trnglobally, and whoevercracksself-drivingcarscan applytheirknowledge to other AI-based projects, such asdronesand robots.Unlike search engines, where people maychoose to use a service thatisgoodenough, usersare more likelyto favourself-drivingcarswith the bestsafety re-cord, meaningthatthe companiesthat bestemployAIto map outthe physical worldand registerthe fewestcrasheswill enjoyoutsize beneﬁts. Each ﬁrm isapproachingthe problemdiﬀerently. Baidu, the Chinese giant, istry-ingto create a self-driving-caroperatingsystem, much like Google’sAndroid in mo-bile devices(although itisunclearhow itplansto make money). Alphabethasitsown autonomous-careﬀort, asdo Uber,Tesla, an electriccarmaker, a herd of little-known startupsand, increasingly, estab-lished carmakers. (Apple isrumoured tohave scaled backitscarambitions.)Self-drivingcarsare justone example ofhowtechnologyﬁrms’ AIstrategiesarepushingbeyond the virtual world ofsoft-ware into hardware. Manycompanies, in-cludingAlphabet, Apple and Microsoft, arealso investingto build specialised, power-ful “AIchips” thatcan powertheirvariousactivities. These will compete with thosemade byNVIDIA, a tech ﬁrm thathas builtan empire on powerful chipsused in va-riousAIrealms, such asautonomouscarsand virtual reality. Itisunclearwhetherthe likesof Alpha-betand Apple will sell these chipsto rivalﬁrmsorkeep them forthemselves. Theyhave an incentive to use theirinnovationsto improve theirown services, rather thanrentingorsellingthem to rivals—whichcould become a problem ifitmeansa veryfewﬁrmsdevelop a meaningful advantagein brute computingpower.Thatbegsthe broaderquestion ofwhetherAIwill furtherconcentrate poweramongtoday’sdigital giants. Itseems like-lythatthe incumbenttech groupswill cap-ture manyofAI’sgains, given theirwealthofdata, computingpower, smartalgo-rithmsand human talent, notto mention ahead starton investing. Historypoints tothe likelihood ofconcentration; both data-basesand personal computersushered inascendancies, ifonlyfora while, of a tinygroup oftech ﬁrms(Oracle and IBMin da-tabases, Microsoftand Apple in personalcomputers).Bythe metricsthatcount—talent, com-putingpowerand data—Google appearstobe in the lead in AI. Itcan aﬀord the clever-estpeople and hassuch a varietyofpro-jects, from dronesto carsto smartsoftware,thatpeople interested in machine learningrarelyleave. Otherﬁrmshad to learn totake AIseriously, butGoogle’sfounderswere earlydevoteesofmachine learningand alwayssawitasa competitive edge.

Such a vi-sion isprobablydecadesaway, butthatdoesnotstop Google from talkingabout it.“We absolutelywantto” crackgeneral AI,saysJeﬀDean, the bossofGoogle Brain. Ifaﬁrm were to manage this, itcould changethe competitive landscape entirely.In the meantime, much will depend onwhethertech ﬁrmsare open and collabora-tive. In addition to publishingpapers,manycompaniestodaymake theirmach-ine-learningsoftware librariesopensource, oﬀeringinternal toolsto rivals andindependentdevelopers. Google’slibrary,TensorFlow, isparticularlypopular. Face-bookhasopen-sourced two ofitslibraries,Caﬀe2 and Pytorch. Opennesshasstrate-gicadvantages. Astheyare used, the librar-iesare debugged, and the ﬁrmsbehindthem getreputational beneﬁts. “Beware ofgeeksbearinggifts,” quipsOren Etzioni ofthe Allen Institute forArtiﬁcial Intelli-gence, anothernon-proﬁtresearch group. One guruofthe ﬁeld worriesthat librar-iessuch asTensorFlowwill bringin talent-ed researchersbutthattheirownersmaystartcharginglateron, oruse them for pro-ﬁtin otherways.

Most tie-upsin America’shealth industryin recentyearshave been “horizontal”, with ﬁrmsattemptingto acquire directcompetitors;instead, the CVS-Aetna deal representsver-tical integration. Asa result, there are fewerobviousoverlapsand lessfatto cut. One rationale forthe deal—assumingthe regulatorswave itthrough—isfor themerged ﬁrm to develop personalisedhealth care thatpeople can easilyget ac-cessto. CVSrunssome 1,100 walk-in medi-cal clinicsin addition to 9,700 retail outlets.Itisalso a pharmacy-beneﬁtsmanager(PBM), a sortofmiddleman thatbuys drugsforinsurersand companies. Because it willswallowAetna’srecordson patientmedi-cal care, itsphysical outletswill have ac-cessto farmore information aboutpa-tients’ chronicillnesses. AsAetna’sboss,MarkBertolini, putit, “We have 10,000newfrontdoorsto the health-care system.”There isanother, more defensive, impe-tusbehind the deal—the prospectofAma-zon goinginto prescription medicine. TheAmerican pharmaceutical marketisan al-luringone forthe online giant. Itis large,worth $450bn in 2016. And itiswidelyre-garded asineﬃcient, leavingcustomerswithoutgood information aboutproductstheyare buying, because ofopaque pricingand middlemen like the PBMs. Accordingto a surveybyCowen, an investmentbank,67% ofAmazon Prime customerswouldlike to buyprescription drugson the web-site. Amazon could be earningasmuch as$10bn a yearfrom drugsby2023, itreckons. Compared with books, toysand otherbulkyitems, the drugsmarketwould ap-pearto be a nirvanaforAmazon. Prescrip-tion medicinesweigh almostnothing, takeup little space and can costhundreds orthousandsofdollarsperpill. Butthree hur-dlesblockthe road to thisidyll. First, the sale and distribution of drugsisheavilyregulated. Amazon would not beable to dump prescription drugsinto thesame fulﬁlmentchannelsasitsother pro-ducts. Itmustacquire pharmaceutical li-cencesforanystate where itwishesto op-erate (italreadyhasthese in 12 states, buthassaid itmeansto use them onlyto sellmedical supplies, which also require the li-cence, notdrugs). Amazon would alsoneed approval from the Food and DrugAd-ministration ata federal level. Operating inacontrolled industrywould be a depar-ture fora free-wheelingtech ﬁrm. Second, mostdrugsare paid forby in-surers, notbyconsumers. The PBMsper-form the complextaskofmatchingpur-chaseswith patients’ insurers, so thatdrugsare paid for. Thatisa source of thesortofopacitythatAmazon would seek toremove. Butthe e-commerce ﬁrm wouldstill need to handle issuesofpayment inthe background, withoutnaggingconsum-ersforinsurance details. Third, although drugsdo come in smallpackages, theirshippingand handling of-ten require special attention. Manydrugs,such asnewcancertreatments, mustbekeptcold throughoutthe supplychain.Others, like opioid painkillers, are danger-ous, and mustbe keptin locked cages. Yetthese drugsare often also the mostexpen-sive. IfAmazon cherry-picksdrugsthat ﬁtwell into itsexistingnetwork, itwill missouton a large slice ofthe market. Custom-erscould ﬁnd itconfusingto be able to getsome prescriptionsthrough Amazon’sstore butnotothers. Amazon could ﬁnd itselfa partner,however. In Julythe bossofExpressScripts, a PBM, said itcould use Amazon asan “eﬃcientproviderin networks”. OrAmazon could buywhatitneeds. JohnBlackledge ofCowen suggeststhatitmightbuyRite Aid, a bigpharmacychain, givingitlicences, a “cold-chain”infrastructureand Rite Aid’ssmall PBMin one swoop.

Jean-Sébastien Jacques, Rio’schiefexecutive, saysitisten yearsahead ofmin-ingrivalsin autonomoustechnology. Forhim and forSimon Thompson, a newchairman appointed on December4th, thequestion ishowmuch such technologycan tame anotherancientfeature ofmin-ing: the boom-and-bustcycle.On a visitto Rio’sHope Downs4 minein the Pilbara, itiseerie atﬁrstto watch300-tonne trucksspeedinguphill in acloud ofred dustwith no one in the cab.Then itbecomesendearing, asyouwatchsupersized roboticmammothsso safety-obsessed thatwhen sagebrush blowsintheirway, theyjudderto a halt.Asforthe mine’smanagers, theyarestruckbythe silence; there isno longer asteadystream ofbanteracrossdrivers’two-wayradios.

ThisyearWalmart’sshareshaverisen by40% on hopesthatithasmore than a ﬁghtingchance. Itisclearthatsellinggroceriesonline isverydiﬀerentfrom sellingbooks. In food, penetration ofe-commerce islow, at2%, com-pared with 9% forall retail. Food isperishable. People will notstuﬀitin theirmouthsunlesstheytrustitsprovenance. Theyalsowantﬂexibility—to buyfood in a store, to orderonline and pickitup themselves, orto have itdelivered to theirhomes. So somephysical infrastructure ishelpful. “I wouldn’twantanothersetofassets,” DougMcMillon, Walmart’sboss, told the EconomicClubofNewYorkin November.He hasrun Walmart’sbusinessesin Europe and Asia, where e-commerce forgroceriesismore developed.

On Septem-ber29th itacquired Parcel, a logisticsstartup. On December 6th itchanged itslegal name from WalmartStores, to justWalmart.There are three reasonsto be optimistic. First, Walmart’sper-formance hasimproved. In the mostrecentquarter, same-storesalesrose by2.7% yearon year, and store traﬃcby1.5%. Food salesincreased attheirfastestpace in sixyears.

Amazon could seizewell-to-do cities, where population densityishigh and home de-liveryismore eﬃcient. Walmartcould continue to rule suburbia.Eitherway, marginswill probablybe squeezed asAmazonthrowsmoneyatthe ﬁghtwith itscustomaryabandon. MrMcMillon knowsthis. “One ofthe challengesatWalmartisthatwe don’thave free money—we are expected to make a proﬁt,” hesays. The dangeristhatitoverestimateshowmuch physical pres-ence itneeds.

Some non-governmental organisa-tionshave been blocked bythe protest-averse Argentine authorities, buta meet-ingofpeople will indeed take place. Oneofmindsisanothermatter. Mostparticipantscan agree on onething. The WTO, which codiﬁesthe multi-lateral rules-based tradingsystem, needshelp. PresidentDonald Trump hasrailedagainstitand threatened to pull Americaout. WithoutAmerican leadership, there islittle hope ofreachingnewdeals. And evenasthe WTO’sdealmakingarm isparalysed,the Trump administration isweakening itsjudicial one bystarvingitofjudges.Despite MrTrump’sthreats, Americadoesnotseem on the verge ofcrashing outofa system ithelped to construct, to relyentirelyon bilateral trade dealsand reme-dies. He maythinkthattrue reciprocitymeansAmerican tariﬀsto match Chineseones. (Forgoods, America’saverage 3.5%,China’s9.9%.) ButCongressislikelyto sty-mie attemptsto raise duties, and anythinghe doesmanage will face swiftand painfulretaliation. RobertLighthizer, the UnitedStatestrade representative, seemsto bestickingto the WTO’srulesfornow. On De-cember4th, forexample, he requested evi-velopment, a Geneva-based think-tank.The sabotagingofthe WTO’sappellatebody, however, isclearlythe handiwork ofthe Trump administration. On December11th the term ofPeterVan den Bossche, theEuropean judge on the body, will expire.He will be the third judge whose reap-pointmentthe Americanshave blocked.On the presentcourse, bythe end of2019 too fewjudgeswill be leftto rule onnewcases(three are required). MarkWu, alawprofessoratHarvard University, wor-riesthatgummingup the judicial arm maymake countriesdoubtthatthe WTOisthebestforum forsettlingdisputes. “The riskislessofan immediate explosion,” he says,“than a slowerdeath bya thousand cuts.”MrLighthizerhashinted ata return tothe old, pre-WTOsystem ofresolvingtradedisputes—bynational muscle ratherthanlawyers. MsMalmstrom saysshe cannotenvisage goingbackto that. Butthe im-passe hasno obviouswayout. Anymanoeuvre to bypassthe American block-age ofthe appellate bodywould be politi-cally, ifnotlegally, untenable. And theAmericanshave notsaid whatreformstheywant.Bull in a China shopAsthe Trump administration kicksattheworkinglegofa limpinginstitution, itisworth recallingthatpreviousAmericanadministrationshave also feltfrustratedwith the WTO. Fewwould disagree that itneedsreform. In particular, China, de-scribed byMsMalmstrom asthe WTO’s“problematicclient”, hasan economicmodel thatsitsawkwardlyinside the WTOsystem. The organisation’srulesweredrafted in the early1990swith transitionaleconomieslike those ofEastern Europe inmind. HosukLee-Makiyama ofthe Euro-pean Centre forInternational PoliticalEconomy, a Brusselsthink-tank, saysthey dence relatingto solar-panel imports tohelp make the case thatanytariﬀswouldbe WTO-compliant. Butan institution can be damagedwithoutblowingitup. Overthe pastfewweeksorganisersofthe meetingin BuenosAireshave been managingexpectationsdown. No one thinksmuch will be agreedon. Some sigh thata committed Americanadministration mighthave achieved anagreementon curbingﬁshingsubsidies, re-vived one easingbarriersto trade in envi-ronmental goods, and organised an ambi-tiousagenda fore-commerce. Instead, theAmericanshave been bickeringoverthelanguage in a proposed jointstatement.Theyquibble with referencesto the “cen-tralityofthe multilateral tradingsystem”and to “development” asan objective.Still, itisunfairto blame the Trump ad-ministration alone forthe likelylack ofpro-gressin BuenosAires.

Butasthe deadline loomed and the share ofimportscovered byanti-dumpingdutiesrose (see chart), the EUand Americabalked atthe idea ofgivingup their tradedefences. On December4th the EUap-proved newrulesto drop the label of“non-marketeconomy”. Butitwill stillapplythird-countrypricingon a case-by-case basis. Mei Xinyuofthe ChineseAcademyofInternational Trade andEconomicCo-operation, an oﬃcial body,callsthis“a trickthatavoidscalling Chinaanon-marketeconomy”.The legal dispute will take years. OnNovember30th the Americanspub-lished theirlegal argumentsin support ofthe EU. Theyoutlined historical instanceswhere economiesin transition weretreated asnon-marketeconomies.

Even today, African countriesstill tradetwice asmuch with Europe astheydo witheach other(see chart). Butthatspirit ofun-itynowanimatesa push fora ContinentalFree-Trade Area (CFTA), involvingall 55countriesin the region. Negotiations be-gan in 2015, aimed atformingthe CFTA bythe end ofthisyear. In contrastto theWTO,African trade talksare makingprogress.Ata meetingon December1stand 2ndin Niamey, the capital ofNiger, Africantrade ministersagreed on ﬁnal tweaks tothe text. Headsofstate will probably sign itin March, once an accompanyingprotocolon goodshasbeen concluded (agreementon serviceshasalreadybeen reached). Buttrade barrierswill nottumble overnight.The CFTAwill come into force onlywhen15 countrieshave ratiﬁed it. Even then, thedeal onlysetsa framework, within whichsome detailsoftariﬀreduction have still tobe worked out. Separate negotiations, cov-eringcompetition, investmentand intel-lectual-propertyrights, are yetto begin.Nonetheless, technocratsare keen totalkup the agreement. ChieduOsakwe, Ni-geria’schiefnegotiatorand chairman ofthe negotiatingforum, seesitasa “massivehistorical opportunity” to escape the colo-nial legacy. Some 82% ofAfrican countries’exportsgo to othercontinents; theyconsistmostlyofcommodities. Bycontrast, overhalfofintra-African trade isin manufac-tured products. Supportersofthe deal ar-gue thatitwill create larger, more compet-itive markets, helpingto ignite Africa’sstalled industrialisation.African leadersalso have an eye on re-lationswith the restofthe world. No lon-gerable to counton unilateral trade con-cessionsfrom rich countries, theyareinstead beingforced into reciprocal deals,which involve more give-and-take. AstrongCFTAwould give Africa extraweightin talkswith Europe and America,arguesGeorge Boatengofthe African Cen-tre forEconomicTransformation, a pan-Af-rican think-tank.Yetpolitical pressure to rush negotia-tionsmayweaken the ﬁnal text.

The DowJonesIndustrial Average haspassed an-othermilestone—24,000—and the morestatisticallyrobustS&P500 indexisup by17% so farthisyear. Emergingmarketshave performed even better, ashave Euro-pean sharesin dollarterms(see chart). Political worriesabouttrade disputes,the potential forwarwith North Koreaand the repeated upheavalsin PresidentDonald Trump’sWhite House: all havecaused onlytemporarysetbacksto inves-tors’ conﬁdence. No wonderthe latestquarterlyreportofthe BankforInterna-tional Settlementsasked whethermar-ketsare complacent, notingthat“accord-ingto traditional valuation gauges thattake a long-term view, some stockmarketsdid lookfrothy”, and pointingoutthat“some froth wasalso presentin cor-porate-creditmarkets”.The authorsofthe BISreportare notthe onlyonesto worrythatmarkets lookexpensive.

Butlong-term proﬁtsexpectationsare “ridiculouslyhigh”, saysBCAResearch, an advisoryﬁrm, with earn-ingsforecastto growat14% a yearin bothAmerica and Europe. Thatwould implyanever-greatershare ofGDPgoingto proﬁts,and an ever-lowershare forworkers. If thatwere to happen, supportforpopulistpar-tieswould go through the roof.Analystsrarelytend to forecastfalls inproﬁts. ButAndrewSmithersofSmithers &Co, a consultancy, pointsoutthatthe earn-ingspershare ofquoted companieshavebecome farmore volatile since 1992, com-pared with the volatilityofproﬁts in thenational accounts. One reason forthis isthe much greaterimportance offoreignproﬁtsin the ﬁguresreported byUS-quoted companies; the overseasportionrose from 18% in 1982 to 38% in 2015.Even allowingforthis, reported proﬁtsare more volatile than theyused to be. MrSmithersarguesthatitisin the interests ofmanagersto presenthigherproﬁtswhenshare pricesrise and to understate proﬁtsin bearmarkets. In the formercase, higherproﬁtswill allowexecutivesto meet tar-getsand exercise theirlucrative share op-tions. Conversely, in a bearmarket, itisworth managerstakinga “kitchen-sink”approach—gettingall the bad newsout ofthe wayso the nextsetofperformancetargetswill startfrom a lowerbase.Share buy-backsadd anotherfactor tothe equation.

The Maduro administrationarrested more than 60 oil executives, ac-cusingthem ofcorruption, and replacingthem with soldierssuch asMrQuevedo,who have no clue howto produce oil. In aChristmasmessage on December3rd, MrMaduro compounded the absurditybyan-nouncinga planned cryptocurrencycalledthe “petro”, backed byVenezuela’soil re-serves, to evade American ﬁnancial sanc-tions. He mightaswell have asked peopleto believe in Santa Claus.The threatto Venezuelan oil productionisreal enough, though.

Also in Britain, LloydsBankingGroup faceslitigation. And itisnot justbanks. Investorsin Britain sued Tesco, a su-permarketchain, forlossescaused by anaccountingscandal in 2014. In Germanyand the Netherlandsinvestorsare seekingcompensation from Volkswagen (VW), acarmaker, forfailingto disclose its manipu-lation ofdiesel-emissionstests. Securitieslitigation ison the rise in Eu-rope fortwo main reasons. The ﬁrstis thatAmerica islesshospitable than itwas tosuch cases. Until 2010 harm suﬀered byfor-eign investorscould be included in Ameri-can lawsuits. Thatchanged with a Su-preme Courtrulingon Morrison vNationalAustralia Bank, which held thatthe lossesofso-called “f-cubed” plaintiﬀs—foreign in-vestorswho boughtsharesin a foreigncompanyon foreign exchanges—wouldhave to be excluded.Once, all the shareholderlitigationagainstVWwould have taken place inAmerica, saysJayEisenhoferofGrant & Ei-senhofer, an American lawﬁrm. The Mor-risonruling, however, meantthatthe cur-rentAmerican class-action suithaslargelybeen limited to municipal pension fundsthatheld VW’sAmerican depositoryre-ceipts(a proxyforitsshares). The second reason forthe increasedpopularityofEurope asa venue forlitiga-tion isa proliferation ofﬁnancingoptions.In Europe, claimantsmustshoulderlegalcostsforboth sidesiftheylose. These canbe astronomical: RBSissaid to have spent£100m on itsshareholderlawsuit, whichwassettled before iteven wentto trial. Financingfrom litigation-funding spe-cialistsisan increasinglycommon way tocoverthe costsofa lawsuit. According to re-search byRPC, a London lawﬁrm, the 20largestfundersploughed £723m into Brit-ish lawsuitsin 2016, up from £437m in 2011.Both the action in GermanyagainstVWand the British Tesco lawsuitare being ﬁ-nanced byInnsworth, a fundingspecialist,backed byan American hedge fund. An-otheroption isto buyinsurance against theriskofadverse costs. Premiumscan eitherbe paid upfront(often byfunders) or becontingenton a successful settlement.Fundersand specialistlawﬁrmsoftenactasco-ordinatorsforsuitsbrought byin-vestors. Thatisimportantin countries suchasBritain and Germany, where collectivecasesgenerallyrequire investorsto opt into legal action. The American system, incontrast, bindsall potential claimants un-lesstheyexplicitlyoptout. Thatisone reason whythe Netherlandshasbecome somethingofa magnetin Eu-rope fordisgruntled investors. Since 2005,ithasallowed collective settlements on anopt-outbasis. Acommon model isforshareholders, includingforeign institu-tions, to be represented bya foundationwhich suesthe companyon theirbehalf inreturn fora share ofanysettlement. Sucharrangementswon payoutsof$353m fromShell in 2007, followinga write-down of itsoil reserves. Butforcasesinvolving foreigncompaniesthe Netherlandsmayhave littleto oﬀer. Acase againstBPafterthe Deepwa-terHorizon spill wasthrown outin 2016.An investorcase againstVWmightfail thejurisdiction test, too. Practical obstaclesto takingaction re-main, saysHarryEdwards, a partneratHerbertSmith Freehills, a London lawﬁrm. Outside the Netherlands, opt-in sys-temsmean investorinteresthasto bedrummed up. Adverse-costinsurance andfundingmaybe available, butthe litigationwill secure backingonlyifthe expected re-turnsare high enough. And in continentalEurope, unlike Britain and America, plaint-iﬀscannotforce companiesto disclose allrelevantfacts—so casesare harderto win.Norin Europe isthere accessto trials byjury. Thismayfavourcompanies, whichsee such trialsasunpredictable, and some-timessettle casesto avoid them. Despitethe rise in litigation, itishardlyopen sea-son in Europe fornuisance claimsfrom dis-gruntled shareholders. 7Shareholder litigationLayingdown thelawEurope’s courts are gaining popularityamong investors seeking legal redress 70FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistDecember9th2017FORmanyitisa reﬂexasunconsciousasbreathing.

Fixed-line deskphoneswere an intrusion in theirday, before the mobilephone broughtworkinterruptionsinto the home. Butthe web isdiﬀerent, with itsunendingnewscycle, social networks hum-mingwith constantconversation, and newsfeedsalgorithmi-callystructured to keep usersscrollingand sharing. The louderthe din, the greaterthe distraction—and the harderto tune itoutforfearofmissingimportantinformation.Distractionsclearlyaﬀectperformance on the job. In a recentessay, Dan Nixon ofthe BankofEngland pointed to a mass ofcompellingevidence thattheycould also be eatinginto produc-tivitygrowth.

What’smore, MrNixon notes, constantinterruptionsaccustom workersto distrac-tion, teachingthem, in eﬀect, to lose focusand seekdiversions.Could thisexplain the rich world’sproductivityslowdown?In a paperpublished in 2007, Sinan Aral and ErikBrynjolfsson, ofthe MassachusettsInstitute ofTechnology, and Marshall Van Al-styne, ofBoston University, analysed ﬁrms’ use ofinformationtechnologyand itseﬀectson labourproductivityand revenuegrowth. Theyfound an inverted U-shape pattern associated withmultitaskingand productivity. An initial increase in multitaskingfrom the increased use ofITseemsto raise productivity. But later,the accumulation ofballsto be juggled reducesperformance andincreasesthe incidence oferror. ITdoeshelp workersin all sortsofways.

Productivitysurged in the late 1990sand early2000sase-mail, digital databasesand the web spread.The beneﬁtstechnologybrought, atthattime, seemed to out-weigh the costofdistraction. Since the mid-2000s, however, pro-ductivitygrowth hastumbled, perhapsbecause the burden ofdistraction hascrossed some critical threshold.Butthisissurelynotthe whole story. Performance across in-dustriesdoesnotﬁtverywell with the idea thatdistraction isthemain cause ofweakproductivity. Overthe pastdecade, labour-productivitygrowth in both manufacturingand construction hasbeen particularlydisappointing—and the problem can hardly bedeskjockeysfritteringawaytime on Pinterest. Weakproductivityisalso a consequence ofthe reallocation ofworkersfrom industrieswith relativelyhigh ratesofgrowth tomore stagnantones. In America health care and education,where labourproductivityispersistentlylow, accountfor morethan halfoftotal employmentgrowth since 2000. Howthen to reconcile evidence ofthe toll taken bynew tech-nologieswith the diﬃcultyin detectinga productivity cost? Onepossibilityisthatﬁrmshave notbeen asstrenuousas mightbe ex-pected in maximisingoutputperworker. Employmentdoes notfall much in response to minimum-wage risesbecause output perworkergoesup. Thatispartlybecause workerstryharder andpartlybecause ﬁrms, faced with a newcost, focusmore on track-ingworkerperformance. Similarly, productivityleaptin the im-mediate aftermath ofthe ﬁnancial crisis, and notbecause ﬁrmslaid oﬀlessproductive workers. Rather, workersappear to haveupped theirgame to convince bossesnotto sackthem. After a de-cade oflowwagesand high proﬁts, ﬁrmsmaybe feeling compla-cent. That, and theirconsequentfailure to invest, may be a betterexplanation ofweakproductivitythan workers’ distraction.Tweetdreams are made ofthisWhetherornotbrainsfried byconstantinterruption are slowinggrowth, the digital deluge takesa toll. MrNixon reckons thatdis-tracted workersbecome lessempathetic, a seriousside-eﬀect inan economywhere human connectionswith customersare castasa defence againstautomation. Distraction also appears to re-duce reported happiness, and thateﬀectmaybe magniﬁed ifitmeansthatfewertasksare completed to the workers’ satisfac-tion—orifthe source ofthe distraction isanotherdistressing newsalert.

In this study, observers countedthe attendees, and the questions theyasked, at 247 departmental talks andseminars in biology, psychology andphilosophy that took place at 35 universi-ties in ten countries. On average, half ofeach seminar’s audience was female.Men, however, were over 2.5 times morelikely to pose questions to the speak-ers—an action that may be viewed (right-ly or wrongly) as a sign of greatercompetence. This male skew in question-asking wasobservable, however, only in those semi-nars in which a man asked the ﬁrst ques-tion. When a woman did so, the gendersplit in question-asking was, on average,proportional to that of the audience.Simply handing the microphone to awoman rather than a man when the ﬂooris opened for questions may make adiﬀerence, however small, to one ofacademia’s most intractable problems.Gender in academiaSHELLFISH thrive in watersrich in nutri-ents.

Although themachine isswathed in patents, othermin-iature devicesare bound to followin time.The MinION, asthe device iscalled, isﬁrstplugged into a laptop. Itworks bysuck-ingstrandsofDNA through a “ﬂowcell”,made up ofan arrayoftinyholesthat arejusta fewnanometres(billionthsofa me-tre) in diameter. The waythatelectricityﬂowsacrossthe surface ofsuch a holechanges, dependingupon the shape ofthemolecule passingthrough it. Asstrands ofDNA are composed offourtypesofsub-unit, called bases, which have diﬀerentshapes, nanopore sequencingpermitstheorderofthese basesto be determined—andwith itthe message carried bya gene. Nanopore’sdevice isnota directcom-petitorto the bigger, more complexma-chinesable to deliverthe high levels ofac-curacydemanded bybusylaboratories.Rather, the MinIONisdesigned to takegene-sequencingoutinto the ﬁeld. The de-vice itselfcosts$1,000 and the ﬂow-cellcartridgesituses, each ofwhich lasts a fewmonths, costaround $500 ifpurchased inbulk. So far, MinIONshave been used to se-quence the DNA ofmicrobesscraped outofthe snowin Antarctica, swabbed oﬀ gla-ciersin Svalbard orsucked outofstagnantpondsin the bowelsofdisused coalminesin Wales. The technologywasalso em-ployed to proﬁle the virusbehind an out-breakofEbola in westAfrica in 2015. Itisnot, though, assimple aspopping asample in one end and gettingthe answer.To provide a trulyportable gene-sequenc-ingdevice, itisnecessaryto miniaturiseand automate the preparation ofsamples.To extractDNA, biological samplesmusthave theircellsbroken open, a processcalled lysing. The extracted DNA needstobe ofsuﬃcientpuritythatthe readings arenotcontaminated. Thisisa trickytask, andone thatrequiressome biochemical train-ingand often the use ofcentrifugesand ex-pensive reagents. Although the ﬁrm iskeepingthe detailsclose to itschest, Ox-ford Nanopore isworkingon a small de-vice called Zumbador, which itclaims willbe able to prep samplesautomatically.Fornow, manyusersare happyto pre-pare samplesthemselves, often becausebyusinga MinIONtheydo nothave towaitfora laboratoryto send backresults.Mars, a large food company, istesting thedevice on production linesin China, look-ingforparticularbacterial pathogens suchasSalmonellaand E. coli.

Hishope isthatonce automated preparation isavailable, real-time monitoringwill beable to spotproblemsalmostinstantly. Itwill also extend the range ofbugsthat canbe detected; currenttestsare forspeciﬁcpathogens, whereassequencingcan iden-tifywhateverbugmightturn up. Early re-sults, saysMrBaker, are promising. The provenance offood isalso a goodcandidate forgenomicinvestigation.

The unIslamichoard castdoubton the president’spublicshowsofprayerand the greatmosque, with sixwhite min-arets, loomingbeside hispalace. Itsur-prised no one who knewthat, asa high-landerfrom Yemen’snorthern mountains,he probablyliked a chaseraftera pleasantchewofqatin the afternoons. Otherswould have remembered how, asa youngarmyoﬃcerin charge ofa checkpoint onthe main road to Taizfrom the Red Sea, hewould wave through whiskysmuggled upfrom Africa ifenough rialscrossed hispalm. Thatblind eye won him useful alliesamongthe merchantsofTaiz. He needed such rusesbecause he was anobody. Hisclan, the Sanhan, wasa lowly,overlooked group in a societyseethingwith wild and largertribesheavilyarmedwith pride and Kalashnikovs. Hisfamilycontained no sheikhs, and hisvillage, ﬂy-blown Bayt-al Ahmar, had no one richenough to subsidise him through oﬃcers’trainingschool. To thatend he washelpedbya southernerand this, too, proved politi-callyuseful. In hisrugged and chronicallyungovernable countrythe short, bull-necked soldier, with hissharp sing-songnorthern accent, hisheavysilvertribal ringand hismesmerisingstare, turned out tohave contactsall overthe place. Hence, in part, hisdizzyingrise to pow-er. From tankcommanderhe became pres-ident, in 1978, ofNorth Yemen, which un-ited with the communistsouth in 1991withhim, naturally, in charge. He wenton torule the newcountry, with maximumguile and graft, forthe next21years. Herose, too, because no one else cared to ruleNorth Yemen, where the two previousin-cumbentshad been dispatched withinnine monthsofeach other: one shotwhilecavortingwith foreign prostitutes, the oth-erminced byan explodingbriefcase. MrSaleh did notwantcourage. He had hisown close shaves, the closestin 2011whenhismosque wasblown up with him insideit. The Saleh Museum, opened in Sana’atwo yearslater, displayed hisscorchedtrousersand the shrapnel taken outof him. Bythen he had stepped down, butonlyafteran extraordinaryspell in power, bol-stered ﬁrstbya wall ofrelativesaroundhim. When he became presidentofthewhole countrytheyassumed keypostsinministriesand the army, while hisnephewTarekheaded the elite Republican Guard;hisson Ahmed wasgroomed to succeedhim. HisSanhan clan wasnowimportant,and the tribal confederation itbelonged to,the Hashid, the mostpowerful in the land.Othermembers, especiallythe al-Ahmartribe (some ofthem cousins, from his ownvillage), prospered too, and non-bloodtribeswere keptin line with handoutsfrom oil revenues, giftsofnewcarsand avastweb ofpatronage controlled byhisparty, the General People’sCongress. In the oil-rich 1990she piled up andpaid oﬀfreely, stashingbillionsof dollars’worth ofgold and propertyunderdiﬀerentnamesin hidey-holesabroad. Hispalace inSana’a boasted marble halls, gold-inlaidfurniture and shelvesofshiny, unopenedbooks. (He relaxed notbyreading, but byplayingbilliardsortoolinground the hillsaboutSana’a in hisluxuryToyota pickup.)Hishome village acquired, amongthe dustand dogs, a compound ofSaleh familyvil-lasclad in coloured marble, and a swarmofsecurityguardsin shades. Nota lot ofmoneytrickled down to desperatelyim-poverished Yemenis, especiallyin thesouth. Butthatwasnothisproblem. Hisproblem washowto stayin power.He compared itto dancingon the heads ofsnakes: these reptileslurkingin his ownpartyand the Hashid confederation, aswell asin rival tribes, though he was snake-in-chief. When hissecuritydetail oncefailed to catch a rare wild blackcamel byropingand draggingit, he used thatmeta-phortoo: Yemen could notbe governed byforce. He broke thatrule in 1978, when hekilled 30 armyoﬃcersforconspiracy, andin 2011, when histroopsshotatleast 50protestershopingforan Arab springin Ye-men. Buttheywere stoogesofal-Qaeda, hebrusquelytold the Western press. Plotting in the shadowsThe Westmaynothave noticed becausehiswileswere so subtle, and hisshift ofalliancesso constant. When itsuited him,he wentsofton the jihadistsand Salaﬁstswho increasinglyinfested the north. In2005 he said he would retire, butin 2006he changed hismind, because hispeoplewere urginghim to stay. He said he wouldleave power“like kickingoﬀmyshoes”,buttheyproved tight-ﬁtting. In 2012 hestepped down, butonlyin exchange forimmunityfrom prosecution. He also neverwentaway, plottingin the shadows, hisportraitstill on shop walls, foronly hecould hold hisdissolvingcountrytogether. Hishalf-secretmarriage ofconvenienceafter2014 with the Shia Houthi rebels, whohad previouslyopposed him, wasriven bymutual mistrust—overpatronage in thenorth, and especiallyoverhislongoﬀ-ondalliance with Saudi Arabia, supposedlytheircommon enemy, and with the UnitedArab Emirates, where hisson Ahmed wasunderloose house arrest. The prospect ofcontinuingthe family’srule through thegood oﬃcesofthe Sunni Gulfstates wasir-resistible. Thatsealed hisfate. 7Snake-in-chiefAli Abdullah Saleh, ﬁrstpresidentofa united Yemen, was killed on December 4th,aged 75ObituaryAli Abdullah SalehEconomist diariesKAL collectionGiftsEconomist booksNotebooks/stationeryPosters and printsEconomist apparelFor studentsPersonalised itemsShop for other items in the store:Available at EconomistStore.comEconomist booksEconomist gearThe gift that keeps on givingInspiring gifts from The Economist StoreHuman labor refers to tuning, patching, updating, and maintenance of database.Copyright © 2017, Oracle and/or its affiliates.
