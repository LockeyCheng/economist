Asthe billionsrolled in, so did the plaudits:Google, Facebook, Amazon andotherswere makingthe world abetterplace. Todaythese com-paniesare accused ofbeingBAADD—big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to de-mocracy. Regulatorsﬁne them, politiciansgrill them and one-time backerswarn oftheirpowerto cause harm. Much ofthistechlash ismisguided. The presumption thatbigbusinessesmustnecessarilybe wicked isplain wrong. Ap-ple isto be admired asthe world’smostvaluable listed com-panyforthe simple reason thatitmakesthingspeople wanttobuy, even while facingﬁerce competition. Manyonline ser-viceswould be worse iftheirproviderswere smaller. Evidenceforthe linkbetween smartphonesand unhappinessisweak.Fake newsisnotonlyan online phenomenon.Butbigtech platforms, particularlyFacebook, Google andAmazon, do indeed raise a worryaboutfaircompetition. Thatispartlybecause theyoften beneﬁtfrom legal exemptions. Un-like publishers, Facebookand Google are rarelyheld responsi-ble forwhatusersdo on them; and foryearsmostAmericanbuyerson Amazon did notpaysalestax. Nordo the titans sim-plycompete in a market. Increasingly, theyare the market it-self, providingthe infrastructure (or“platforms”) formuch ofthe digital economy. Manyoftheirservicesappearto be free,butusers“pay” forthem bygivingawaytheirdata. Powerfulthough theyalreadyare, theirhuge stockmarketvaluationssuggestthatinvestorsare countingon them to double oreventriple in size in the nextdecade.There isthusa justiﬁed fearthatthe tech titans will use theirpowerto protectand extend theirdominance, to the detrimentofconsumers(see page 18). The trickytaskforpolicymakers isto restrain them withoutundulystiﬂinginnovation.The less severe contestThe platformshave become so dominantbecause theybeneﬁtfrom “networkeﬀects”. Size begetssize: the more sellers Ama-zon, say, can attract, the more buyerswill shop there, which at-tractsmore sellers, and so on. Bysome estimates, Amazon cap-turesover40% ofonline shoppingin America. With more than2bn monthlyusers, Facebookholdsswayoverthe media in-dustry. Firmscannotdo withoutGoogle, which in some coun-triesprocessesmore than 90% ofweb searches. FacebookandGoogle control two-thirdsofAmerica’sonline ad revenues.America’strustbustershave given tech giantsthe beneﬁt ofthe doubt. Theylookforconsumerharm, which ishard to es-tablish when pricesare fallingand servicesare “free”. Theﬁrmsthemselvesstressthata giant-killingstartup is justa clickawayand thattheycould be toppled bya newtechnology,such asthe blockchain. Before Google and Facebook, Alta Vis-ta and MySpace were the bee’sknees. Who remembersthem?However, the barriersto entryare rising. Facebook notonlyownsthe world’slargestpool ofpersonal data, butalso itsbig-gest“social graph”—the listofitsmembersand howtheyareconnected. Amazon hasmore pricinginformation than anyotherﬁrm. Voice assistants, such asAmazon’sAlexa and Goo-gle’sAssistant, will give them even more control overhowpeople experience the internet. China’stech ﬁrmshave theheftto compete, butare notaboutto getunfettered access toWestern consumers. Ifthistrend runsitscourse, consumerswill suﬀer asthe techindustrybecomeslessvibrant. Lessmoneywill go into start-ups, mostgood ideaswill be boughtup bythe titansand, onewayoranother, the proﬁtswill be captured bythe giants.The earlysignsare alreadyvisible. The European Commis-sion hasaccused Google ofusingcontrol ofAndroid, its mo-bile operatingsystem, to give itsown appsa legup. Facebookkeepsbuyingﬁrmswhich could one daylure usersaway: ﬁrstInstagram, then WhatsApp and mostrecentlytbh, an app thatletsteenagerssend each othercomplimentsanonymously. Al-though Amazon isstill increasingcompetition in aggregate, asindustriesfrom groceriesto television can attest, it can alsospotrivalsand squeeze them from the market. The rivalryremedyWhatto do? In the past, societieshave tackled monopolies ei-therbybreakingthem up, aswith Standard Oil in 1911, orbyreg-ulatingthem asa publicutility, aswith AT&Tin 1913. Todayboth those approacheshave bigdrawbacks. The traditionaltoolsofutilitiesregulation, such asprice controls and proﬁtcaps, are hard to apply, since mostproductsare free and wouldcome ata high price in forgone investmentand innovation.Likewise, a full-scale break-up would cripple the platforms’economiesofscale, worseningthe service theyoﬀerconsum-ers. And even then, in all likelihood one ofthe Googlettes orFacebabieswould eventuallysweep all before itasthe inexo-rable logicofnetworkeﬀectsreasserted itself.The lackofa simple solution deprivespoliticiansof easyslogans, butdoesnotleave trustbustersimpotent. Two broadchangesofthinkingwould go a longwaytowardssensiblytamingthe titans. The ﬁrstisto make betteruse of existingcom-petition law. Trustbustersshould scrutinise mergersto gaugewhethera deal islikelyto neutralise a potential long-termthreat, even ifthe targetissmall atthe time. Such scrutinymighthave prevented Facebook’sacquisition ofInstagramand Google’sofWaze, which makesnavigation software. Toensure thatthe platformsdo notfavourtheirown products,oversightgroupscould be setup to deliberate on complaintsfrom rivals—a bitlike the independent“technical committee”created bythe antitrustcase againstMicrosoftin 2001. Immu-nityto contentliabilitymustgo, too.Second, trustbustersneed to thinkafresh abouthow techmarketswork. Acentral insight, one increasinglydiscussedamongeconomistsand regulators, isthatpersonal data are thecurrencyin which customersactuallybuyservices. Throughthatprism, the tech titansreceive valuable information—ontheirusers’ behaviour, friendsand purchasinghabits—in re-turn fortheirproducts. JustasAmerica drewup sophisticatedrulesaboutintellectual propertyin the 19th century, so itneeds Tamingthe titansGoogle, Facebookand Amazon are increasinglydominant. Howshould theybe controlled?Leaders12LeadersThe EconomistJanuary20th20182anewsetoflawsto govern the ownership and exchange ofdata, with the aim ofgivingsolid rightsto individuals.In essence thismeansgivingpeople more control over theirinformation. Ifa userso desires, keydata should be madeavailable in real time to otherﬁrms—asbanksin Europe arenowrequired to do with customers’ accountinformation. Reg-ulatorscould oblige platform ﬁrmsto make anonymised bulkdata available to competitors, in return fora fee, a bitlike thecompulsorylicensingofa patent. Such data-sharingrequire-mentscould be calibrated to ﬁrms’ size: the biggerplatformsare, the more theyhave to share. These mechanismswouldturn data from somethingtitanshoard, to suppresscompeti-tion, into somethingusersshare, to fosterinnovation.None ofthiswill be simple, butitwould tame the titanswithoutwreckingthe gainstheyhave brought. Userswouldﬁnd iteasierto switch between services. Upstartcompetitorswould have accessto some ofthe data thatlargerﬁrms holdand thusbe betterequipped to growto maturitywithout be-inggobbled up. And shareholderscould no longerassume mo-nopolyproﬁtsfordecadesto come. 7WHATdo high-speed rail-ways, school lunchesandarmybaseshave in common?Perhapsnotmuch, which maybe one reason forthe dramaticcollapse ofCarillion, a jack-of-all-tradescontractorthatdid abewilderingarrayofworkforBritain’spublicsector. On January15th the ﬁrm wentinto liq-uidation, castingdoubton the prospectsofits43,000 employ-ees, 30,000 subcontractorsand the fulﬁlmentofgovernmentcontractsstretchingthree decadesinto the future.The company’sfall isa storyofcommercial overreach andmiscalculation (see page 48). Butitisalso the storyof a politicalphilosophy. Carillion exempliﬁed a wayofrunningthe statethatwaspioneered underMargaretThatcherand which wenton to conquerthe world. Where once governmentsprovidedpublicservices, theynowcommission them from private com-panies. The idea isto subjectmoribund state monopolies tothe competition and innovation ofthe market. Yeta string offailuresin Britain, ofwhich Carillion isthe latest, meansthatthe countrywhich converted the world to “contractingout”risksbecominga cautionarytale. Votersare ﬂirting with a La-bouropposition thathasalreadyvowed to renationalise in-dustriesand nowsaysitwould bringmanypubliccontractsbackin-house. The Carillion aﬀaircould markthe collapse notjustofa company, butofan idea.The biggertheycomeIn a sense, Carillion isa good example ofhowa failure ofcon-tracting-outisbetterthan a failure in the publicsector. Itslosseswill be borne chieﬂybyshareholdersand creditors, not tax-payers. Lookcloser, however, and the demise highlights howcontractingwill notlive up to itspromisesunlessit changes.Even iftaxpayersare notbailingCarillion out, they maystillbearhundredsofmillionsofpoundsin costsbecause of pro-jectdelays, the transferofcontractsand the continuing need toprovide vital services. And Carillion could yetbring downthousandsofsubcontractors. The companyhad become al-mosttoo bigto fail. Itsfragilityshould have disqualiﬁed itfromHS2, a decades-longhigh-speed rail project. Instead, ministersseemed to see the £1.4bn ($1.9bn) contractasa lifeline.Thismoral hazard isaggravated bythe market’sunhealthyconcentration. Onlythree companiesoperate private prisonsin Britain, forinstance. Abillion-pound contractto redevelop aLondon hospital attracted onlytwo bidders. The governmentroutinelycommissionsmassive, long-term projectsbased onfewerquotesthan voterswould getforreﬁttingtheir kitchen.There isalso the taintofprivate-sectorgreed. Carillion’sboard ensured thatthe bonusesofitsmanagerscannot beclawed back. And thisweekthe National AuditOﬃce reportedthatthe Private Finance Initiative (PFI), an accountinggimmickdesigned to getborrowingoﬀthe government’sbalance-sheet,hasled to billionsin extra costswithoutclearbeneﬁt. Howto ﬁxall this? PFI, though ﬂawed, isonlypartof theproblem. Itsuse hasbeen falling. More broadly, the remedy forbad managementand weakcompetition in the private sectorisnot, asLaboursays, to revertto bad managementand nocompetition in the publicsector. Britonsmayhave forgottenthe 1970s, butone reason forcontracting-outwasthatpublic-sectorroads, servicesand hospital-buildingwere often shod-dyand wasteful. Instead, Britain needsto make itsprivate marketsmore eﬃ-cient, byimprovingcommissioningand loweringbarriers toentry. More standardised contractswould make the tenderingprocesslessburdensome, encouragingsmall and foreign ﬁrmsto bid, despite lackingbigEnglish legal departments. Thatwould increase the competition faced byﬁrmslike Carillion,partofwhose competitive advantage wasitsknowledge ofhowto navigate the complexcontractingprocess.Acouple ofdecadesago inexperienced civil servants wereroutinelydiddled byarmiesoflawyershired byprivate ﬁrms.Today’scommissionersare better, butstill fall forfalse econo-mies. Theyfavourlowbids, onlyforbiddersto renegotiatetermsupwardslater. Commissioningteams, and the bodiesthatauditthem, have been squeezed byspendingcuts, a smallsavingnextto the size ofthe contracts. Overstretched bureau-cratsare also more likelyto award contractsto known outﬁts,like Carillion, which oﬀerto roll lotsofservicesinto one tempt-ingbundle—givingthe companythe whip hand. Some quartersofgovernmentseem to believe thatthe eﬃ-ciencyand innovation ofthe private sectorhappen by magic.In realitytheycome aboutonlywhen contracting-outis sub-jectto the discipline ofa real market. Withoutcompetition,private-sectormanagersare no more dynamicthan the bu-reaucratstheyreplaced. Ifthe governmentcannotcreate amarketworthyofthe name, votersmaydecide to throw outthe idea altogether. Thatwould be costlyindeed. 7Carillion’s collapseBritain’s hard bargainsThe world’s leading privatiserofpublicservices needs to getbetteratitThe EconomistJanuary20th2018 Leaders131INDECEMBERa newdollarbillcame into circulation adornedwith the signature ofSteve Mnu-chin. Instead ofhisusual scrawl,the treasurysecretaryopted toprinthisname. Ifhe hoped thathisbesthandwritingwould givethe greenbacka ﬁllip, he maywell be disappointed. The dollarreached a peakagainst a bas-ketofothercurrenciesa yearago and hasnotthreatened to re-gain it. Gurusofthe foreign-exchange marketsagree that 2018islikelyto be anotheryearofmodestdecline. Thatis becauseofthree sourcesofdownward pressure.The ﬁrstrelatesto the world economy. The dollar’sdescentisnotso much a judgmenton America’sﬁtnessasa sign of theburgeoninghealth ofotherplaces. So longasAmerica wasoneofthe onlyplacesthatcould be relied upon foreconomicgrowth, there wasa powerful logicto the dollar’sstrength. Abroad-based global upswing—evidentin everythingfromboomingstockmarketsto a surgingoil price (see page 59)—meansthatinvestorsare nowrushinginto currenciesotherthan the dollar. Thateﬀectisprovingstrongerthan the expecta-tion thatAmerican ﬁrmswill repatriate more proﬁts thankstothe recenttaxcut. And itseemslikelyto continue.The second source ofdownward pressure reﬂectsa changein policymakers’ attitudes. Until quite recently, no countryseemed keen on a strongexchange rate.

Anote from theirstrategistBrieﬁngDear Jeﬀ, Mark and Sundar, if I mayIimagine your concern about the simmering tech backlash has grownsince we ran into each other in the desert in September. The heatdirected at your ﬁrms has certainly risen. Attached to this e-mail youwill ﬁnd the full report I promised, analysing the grave political andbusiness risks that your ﬁrms face. I hope you will read everything Iam sending in full, and please do not distribute my work to your un-derlings, as none of us want this e-mail to leak to the press.The takeaway is that it is looking more likely that one of you could endup like the giant structure at Burning Man which the crowd torches,watching with rapt attention as it burns down to ash.Things have been rough in Europe for a while. They are getting worse.Having levelled a ﬁne of $2.7bn against Google in 2017, the EuropeanCommission’s Magrethe Vestager wants to go further. National gov-ernments are also baring their teeth. In December Germany’s carteloﬃce accused Facebook of unfairly using its position to track internetusers. France has threatened to ﬁne Facebook for sharing data be-tween its various apps. Almost every day you get hammered for notproperly policing the content, including extremists’ videos, revengeporn and fake news, that appears on your platforms. America is not the haven it was. Under Barack Obama tech was treatedas a dazzling national asset; he had your back. The candidates in2020, whoever they are, are likely to run on an anti-tech platform ofsome sort. Democrats have already pledged to “crack down on cor-porate monopolies”. The Republicans—besides hating you for beingcoastal liberals desperate to promote your politically correct world-view—have some business worries, too. Just look at how the Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) is trying to block AT&T’s acquisition of TimeWarner, a content company. I know they gutted net neutrality: butthat had more to do with hating everything Obama did than valuing alight touch with the internet. Meanwhile a handful of state attorneys general, including Missouri’s,have launched probes into Google. Any of these could spark a ﬁre. Thefederal antitrust case against Microsoft started after states investi-gated the company’s conduct; Texas played a pivotal role in handi-capping Standard Oil in the 1880s. The Sherman Act of 1890 followedand by 1911—before the Clayton Act was even passed—John D. Rocke-feller’s pride and joy, the greatest company of its day, was lying onthe ﬂoor in 34 parts. Knowing that a consultant in Washington refersto Amazon, Facebook and Google as “Standard Commerce, StandardSocial and Standard Data” should make you shudder.Rockefeller was once the richest man in the world. Don’t think thatcrown will help whichever of you is wearing it when the music stops.The fact that four of the ﬁve most valuable publicly traded ﬁrms in theCoping with techlashAdvalancheSource: eMarketer*Estimate    †ForecastUnited States, net digital advertising revenue, $bn020406080100120200809101112131415161718*19†GoogleFacebookOther companiesworld are technology companies, with a combined market value of$3trn, gives you muscle. So do the massive revenues which most ofyou turn into proﬁts. But the fact that all the ﬁgures associated withyour industry are huge—except for your tax bills—is one reason youhave so many enemies.There is one ray of light. Almost all your services remain wildly popularwith consumers; they use your products to communicate, to navigate,to search for stuﬀ, to buy things and to socialise. They cannot imaginelife without you. This is one reason investors have dismissed anti-techrhetoric as political grandstanding. But today’s market sentimentcould change quickly. An analyst at RBCCapital, Mark Mahaney, re-cently published a list of “top ten internet surprises for 2018”. “Mate-rial regulatory action” against tech was number one; he rated theprobability as low but “higher than ﬁnancial markets ascribe”. Andthe impact could be huge.“Tech” is not yet a four-letter word, but it could soon become one.BAADD to worseYou are an industry that embraces acronyms, so let me explain thesituation with a new one: “BAADD”. You are thought to be too big,anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy. Those who dislike you for being big draw on research from The Econo-mist, think-tanks and academia pointing to the rising concentrationin American business, some of which links high corporate proﬁts toinequality. The value of your mountains of data is becoming obvious,especially as you continue to push into new areas that collect moreinformation about consumers while binding them closer to you, suchas the home microphones you are careful to call home speakers.Facebook and Google are responsible for nearly 80% of news publish-ers’ referral traﬃc. In 2017 they claimed around 80% of every newonline-ad dollar in America. Google dominates as much as 85% ofonline-search-ad revenue worldwide. When you combine the stuﬀAmazon sells itself with the stuﬀ others sell using it as a marketplace,the company controls some 40% of America’s online commerce. Many also believe you to be anti-competitive. Amazon is a retailerwhich is also a marketplace. Google determines the position thatpublishers get in search results and which ads are served to theirpatrons—as well as controlling the system that says if the ads wereread and should be paid for. Ms Vestager ﬁned it for hurting rivalonline-shopping services; it could face further charges for forcingsmartphone makers using its Android operating system to includevarious Google apps. All three of your ﬁrms have used insights from the data you gather tospot incipient rivals and buy them up. Facebook’s little-known appOnavo, which tracks users’ smartphone activity, helped it spot severalpotential threats, including Instagram, a photo app, which it boughtin 2012; WhatsApp, a messaging service, for which it paid a stunning$22bn in 2014; and tbh, a social-polling app, which it acquired lastyear. When Snapchat rebuﬀed it in 2013, it responded by cloning theapp’s most successful features. There’s a potential lesson from his-tory here. Microsoft tried to buy the nascent browser company Net-scape in the 1990s; when it failed, it put lots of the browser’s featuresinto its own product, making it freely available to all. That got it into alot of trouble. Some see the weak share price of Snap, Snapchat’sparent company, as proof that challenging Google’s and Facebook’sonline-ad duopoly has become nearly impossible. Afurther charge is that tech ﬁrms’ products are addictive. Peopleargue about this, but many feel that people who spend time on socialmedia, especially teens, are less happy than peers. Rates of teendepression and suicide have risen in some places; some adults havebeen shown to be more prone to insomnia, depression and anxietydue to online activities. Two of Apple’s shareholders—the CaliforniaState Teachers’ Retirement System pension fund and Jana Partners, ahedge fund—recently demanded more be done to help youngsters’smartphone addiction. You know you are in trouble if a Wall Streetﬁrm is lecturing you about morality.In addition to harming mental health, your ﬁrms are charged withdamaging democracy. Social-media ﬁrms create ﬁlter bubbles,where users are fed information conﬁrming their existing beliefs;they spread fake news that reinforces political polarisation. After lastyear’s terror attacks in London, Theresa May and others pointedﬁngers at YouTube, where jihadists promote extremist propaganda.Russia’s use of social media in America’s 2016 presidential race re-ﬂected particularly poorly on Facebook, which was seen as doing toolittle to stamp out deceptive ads and fake news stories. As for nuclearbraggadocio on Twitter, let’s not even go there.Proposed actionsWas it Sun Tzu who said: “Your most unhappy customers are yourgreatest source of learning”? Actually, no. It was Bill Gates. Less goodon an ancient Chinese battleﬁeld: wiser, through bitter experience,in the ways of antitrust. These days your unhappiest customers don’tjust moan; they go online to discuss innovative regulatory schemes,some of them quite wacky: Joshua Wright, a professor at GeorgeMason University, calls this “hipster antitrust”. Hipsterish or not,here are some of the ideas making the rounds, with the most damag-ing ﬁrst: Break upThis has several supporters, especially on the left. One is Barry Lynnof the Open Markets Institute (he was dismissed from the New Ameri-ca Foundation last year, allegedly because Google’s Eric Schmidtdisagreed with his take on tech). Tim Wu, who was inﬂuential in theObama White House—he coined the term “net neutrality”—wasrecently overheard telling an Economistjournalist that he is in favourof a revival of “the big case tradition” of trustbusting. The DOJor theEuropean Commission could try and force Facebook to get rid ofInstagram and WhatsApp (the deal European regulators really careabout), thus creating three rival social networks. Google could besplit from YouTube (which, kind of remarkably, is itself the world’ssecond-largest search engine) or be forced to spin oﬀ DoubleClick,the technology it bought in 2007 that places ads across the web. Such gambits might well fail; but that risk is not the deterrent youmight expect. Mr Wu and others think such attempts serve a greatergood even if their subject survives. Before eventually breaking upAT&T, which controlled America’s telephones, regulators forced it tolicense its technology. Neither IBMin the 1960s nor Microsoft in the1990s was actually split up. But IBMhad to open its platform to in-dependent software developers and Microsoft was obliged to disclosedetails about the workings of its Windows operating system to rivals.Some scholars reckon this government-ordained disruption was asmuch of a boostto progress as any endogenous “creative destruc-The Economist January20th2018BrieﬁngCopingwithtechlash1912Monopoly is not a gameSource: Guy Rolnik at the University of ChicagoMentions of “antitrust” in Democratic and Republican platforms024681012190010203040506070809020001016DemocraticRepublicantion”. They may not be going too far when they trace the rise of yourgeneration of tech ﬁrms to those antitrust cases. Pre-emptive action might sometimes be an option. Some see yoursearch for a second headquarters, Jeﬀ, as a portent of such a strategy:astep towards spinning oﬀ Amazon Web Services. (This would notallay concerns about Amazon being both a retailer and marketplace,but it could subdue and distract regulators.) The creation of Alphabetas a holding company in 2015 means that splitting, say, Google fromYouTube would be less hard than in years gone by.Self-severance might be preferable to waiting for regulators to arbi-trarily decide which limb to sever. But it is still a big step. An alterna-tive is just lying low. Do not provoke regulators, as Mr Gates did (hecalled one FTCcommissioner a communist). Do spend some of yourmoney on inﬂuence. In 2017 the internet sector spent $50m on lob-bying in America, which is three times what it spent in 2009—but stillonly a quarter of what pharma ﬁrms spend. Your K-street battalionsshould remind regulators that attacking deals which have alreadybeen done chills the market. And the antitrust hipstersneed to knowthat break-ups are not stable solutions. The network eﬀects that makebigger networks more attractive to new joiners give these markets awinner-takes-all quality. One of the Googlettes, or the Facebabies,will do better than all the rest, and a new giant will rise. Utility regulationThat said, taking this winner-takes-all argument too far could back-ﬁre. Mark, you and your peers may all come to rue the day you de-scribed Facebook as a “utility”. You were trying to argue that Face-book’s market-dominating social network could be as ubiquitous aselectricity. In doing so you armed your critics. Utilities so big thateveryone depends on them get regulated. That could be really disastrous. Have a look at “Railroaded” by RichardWhite, a historian at Stanford. The Interstate Commerce Commission(ICC) was created in 1886 to stop train companies discriminatingagainst particular farmers by establishing set and transparent pric-ing. It quickly overreached and ended up regulating trucking and thetelegraph. It also proved chronically prone to regulatory capture—which, I admit, might be an upside for you, but which in the case of theICCwas a disaster. Price regulation is hard for services that are basically free to the user.It is possible, though, that a regulator could force prices up—forexample by insisting that you oﬀer customers the chance to pay for anad-free service. A more likely approach, though, would be to capproﬁts. On the basis of your third-quarter ﬁgures, a mandated 20%rate of return would represent a fall in proﬁtability rates of 11% forGoogle and 56% for Facebook. Your share prices would plunge.Prevent new acquisitionsIn 1968 America’s merger guidelines suggested that any acquisition ofacompany with a market share of more than 3% by one with a sharehigher than 15% should be challenged by theDOJ. There are no limitslike that any more. For the past four decades American antitrustthinking has been in thrall to the argument which Robert Bork, alegal scholar, made in “The Antitrust Paradox”: consumer welfare isthe thing antitrust should worry about most. In practice, this hasboiled down to thinking that if prices don’t go up no harm is done.Around the same time economists of the Chicago School, devoted tothe idea that markets are self-correcting, started to have a big inﬂu-ence on antitrust enforcement under President Ronald Reagan—or,rather, lack of enforcement. It is a sign of the times that the University of Chicago is today home toseveral professors, such as Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik, callingloudly for more scrutiny of tech ﬁrms. Many believe that lookingsimply at prices and market shares is too simplistic—especially whentechnology is often free to the user and constantly changing theshape of the market. One reason that Britain’s Oﬃce of Fair Tradingwas relaxed about Facebook’s Instagram purchase was that it sawInstagram as a “camera and photo-editing app”, not a social net-work, and thus unlikely to ever be “attractive to advertisers on astand-alone basis”. Clearly they lacked imagination. Europe has always used a range of metrics, taking on board marketconcentration and consumer welfare—which includes price, qualityand the diversity of products in the market—to evaluate fair competi-tion. And countries there clearly now want to police more deals. Lastyear Germany and Austria changed their merger-review policies toassess deals based on the values, not revenues, of the acquired ﬁrms.This will enable them to scrutinise the acquisition of startups that donot yet make money. Ms Vestager has suggested this could applyacross Europe. Some would like to see it applied in America.Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator, has proposed two bills tochange the standard for big deals, requiring ﬁrms to prove that theirdeal would be helpful to competition and to report data about amerger’s impact for ﬁve years. Those bills won’t pass, but a “potentialcompetition doctrine” which looks at what the small fry might be-come, not at what they are today, could emerge through new prece-dents. It is also possible that bodies of user data, as well as marketshares, might get considered.My advice? Don’t pursue any big deals in this current climate. Micro-soft misjudged the mood by trying to buy Intuit, a maker of ﬁnancialsoftware, for $1.5bn in 1994; the episode drew attention to otheraspects of its market power. And, frankly, small deals may be out, too.Facebook’s acquisition of tbh is for a paltry $80m, but it has stillsparked cries of foul from tech watchers such as Ben Thompson atStratechery, a newsletter, who think that network eﬀects mean nosocial networks should be allowed to merge. For the time being, yourshopping trolleys should be kept empty.Data portability and interoperabilityThere are two overlapping issues about customer data. One is thatdata bind users to you; the other is that data give you an anti-com-petitive edge. Remedies to the ﬁrst problem seek to let customersmove their data elsewhere; remedies to the second seek to force youto share their data with others. Google already voluntarily oﬀers a “takeout service” which lets usersexport a copy of their data. Europe’s General Data Protection Regu-lation, which comes into eﬀect this May, will extend the principle ofdata portability to other platforms. Observers compare it to howmobile-phone users can switch networks without losing their phonenumber. This should not worry you too much. Most customers won’tcare; very few people are up for the hassle of actually using Google’stakeout service. And your dominance means there is very little fund-ing for new search engines and social networks, and thus few alterna-tive services to which consumers can port their data. 20BrieﬁngCopingwithtechlashThe Economist January20th20182But that dominance has a downside. It is the reason why some peoplewant to force ﬁrms to oﬀer “APIkeys” which give competitors access toparticular data, such as Amazon’s sales ﬁgures or the “social graph” ofFacebook’s users’ connections. You will probably want to ﬁght sharingdata in such ways, because the critics have a point: newcomers arehard put to compete. The days when Instagram was able to grow byusing an APIthat allowed people to discover all the people they fol-lowed on Twitter as soon as they joined are long gone. You may ﬁndthat you have surprising allies in the ﬁght, too. Some privacy ad-vocates ﬁnd the idea of data being forcibly shared pretty worrying.Losing that ﬁght could be uncomfortable, but it would hardly bedeadly. Indeed, while it would hit your share price, it could oﬀerlong-term advantages. The way in which it opens you up to competi-tion reinforces your centrality to the ecosystem—and that ecosystemmay, as a result, grow faster. The interoperability forced on Microsoftat the turn of the century, which allowed rivals to make their productsmore compatible with Windows, had that sort of accelerating eﬀect—and Microsoft has hardly gone away. It is worth more than three timesas much now as it was then. Anew dispute-resolution groupTechlashers think one reason regulators have come up short is thatthey are overburdened policing too many industries. New groups tohandle complaints and resolve disputes could make things faster andsimpler. If a retailer feels it has been unfairly squashed in Amazon’ssearch results, or a newspaper believes its ranking in Facebook’s feedsis too low, they could go to such outﬁts for redress.There are two potential models. Firms could start their own “technicalcommittees” made up of external experts with access to the relevantproprietary code, data and algorithms. They would be empowered todecide whether other ﬁrms are being fairly treated. Again, that iswhat happened in the Microsoft case. The alternative would be anindependent external tribunal. America has panels for disputes aboutpatents and about discrimination by cable-TVoperators which mightserve as precedents. You may not like the idea of creating a new tribunal (or the very word“tribunal”), but it is in your interest to see complaints resolved easilyand cost-eﬀectively. In the meantime, start being more careful abouthow you treat rival ﬁrms. It might have been diﬀerent before, butanti-competitive behaviour is suddenly being taken very seriously.Like sexual harassment accusations, it carries a reputational cost.“M”, for monopolist, is today’s scarlet letter. Content liabilityThe laws and precedents that free you from liability for the contentthat you host have been a boon; but they were not set up for a world inwhich your platforms have become essential media properties in theirown right. Your blanket protection is not going to last.Though some of you have tasked your lobbyists with trying to weakenit, sensing the thin end of a wedge, an American bill that would holdyou liable for online sex-traﬃcking is likely to pass. Germany can nowimpose fat ﬁnes if ﬂagged content is not taken down within 24 hours.Laws of this nature are probably not the catastrophes you have de-nounced them to be. You will have to hire more “moderators”, but intime you will develop new technologies to screen out undesirablecontent, as you already do with spam. Google’s ability to deal with“right to be forgotten” claims, which enable people to request infor-mation about them to be taken down, has become a well-oiled mach-ine, far from the tremendous burden some had feared. The way aheadIn general, when you can get out ahead of the issue you should do so.Embracing transparency about who pays for political ads beforeCongress got around to requiring it of you was a smart move. Look atsetting up your own technical committees, too. Your new-year’s pledge to “ﬁx Facebook”, Mark, looks like a boldeﬀort in this direction. Have a care, though: some people may wantmore ﬁxing than you are happy to oﬀer. There are some who say youcan never deliver what is needed without scrapping your ad-basedbusiness model, which will always value engagement over the qualityof the experience. And when ﬁxes like changing the newsfeed algo-rithms have eﬀects on lots of other companies, you may both harmyour business and reinforce concerns about its immense power. It is critical that you compete with each other. If you are waging waron various fronts, such as commerce and digital advertising, you lookalot less monopolistic. This is probably an argument for keepingalive businesses that you might otherwise scale back, as Google hasdone with its social oﬀering, Google+. Acting as if your rivals are toowell-resourced and entrenched for even another giant to take onlends credence to the arguments against you.And there’s another lesson from the robber barons—one that some ofyou and your peers have already embraced. Philanthropy can changepeople’s opinions and shape your legacies into the far future. In partbecause you do not employ as many people as corporate giants ofprevious eras, it is critical to think about local initiatives that canwoo public opinion around the world. Mark has made the biggeststrides in setting up a foundation. The rest of you could form perso-nal or corporate foundations, too.

As inAmerica, anotherlarge and tumultuousdemocracy, the Supreme Courtplaysan es-sential role notonlyasa ﬁnal legal arbiterbutalso asa counterweightto the capriceofthe executive and legislative branches.Yetunlike America’snine Supreme Courtjustices, India’s31(thatistheirconstitution-allyordained strength; the actual numbervariesand iscurrently25) neversitasagroup. Instead the chiefjustice, normallythe court’slongest-servingjudge, hasthejob ofchoosingwhen to hearcasesandthen ofassigningeach to a “bench” oftwoormore justices.In theory, these powershelp justice tobe done, byallowingthe courtto hearcasesfaster, and the chiefjustice to acceler-ate the mostpressingonesand steertech-nical subjectsto judgeswith the relevantexpertise. Buttheyalso allowthe chief jus-tice to ignore, speed ordelaycertain dos-siersforlessedifyingreasons, and to feedcontroversial casesto colleagueswhose re-cordssuggesta particularoutcome.

One oftheircomplaintsisthat thecurrentchiefjustice, DipakMisra, appearsroutinelyto have assigned controversialcasesto juniorjudges.MrMisra, who tookoﬃce in August andisdue to retire in October, hasnotrespond-ed to the charges. Perhapshe expectsthiscloud to blowover, asothershave in thepast. The trouble isthatthere isnot justonerecentcase whose handlinghasraised eye-brows, butseveral. Two ofthese touch upon MrMisra him-self. One involvesthe suicide note writtenbyan ousted chiefministerofthe state ofArunachal Pradesh, detailingallegationsthatSupreme CourtjudgesincludingMrMisra (before he became chiefjustice) haddemanded a bribe ofsome $13m to rule inhisfavourin the case thatended up depriv-inghim ofoﬃce—and drivinghim to hanghimself.

In retrospect, itwas alsosomethingofa Pyrrhicone. FewexpectedMaithripala Sirisena to defeatthe incum-bent, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in the presiden-tial election of2015. Afterall, MrRajapaksa,although increasinglyauthoritarian, hadpresided in 2009 overthe defeatofthe sep-aratistTamil Tigers, endingSri Lanka’s26-yearcivil war. MrSirisena wasmerely a re-belliousmemberofthe president’sownSri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP). To winand then to govern, MrSirisena relied onthe supportofthe SLFP’smain rival, theUnited National Party(UNP). AsSri Lan-kansprepare to vote in local elections onFebruary10th, thatalliance hascome tohaunthim. In theory, the alliance between the UNPand MrSirisena’sfaction ofthe SLFP endedin December. Butthisisa polite ﬁction ne-cessitated bythe campaign. In practice, nei-thergroup hassuﬃcientnumbersin par-liamentto govern withoutthe other.

With a handful offellowBei-hanggraduates, she formed a group onWeChat, a messagingapp, to discusstheabuse theyhad suﬀered. MsLuo decided totake hercase to the university. Forthreemonths, the college remained silentwhileMrChen began hisown campaign, warn-ingpossible accusersnotto letthemselvesbecome “agentsofevil foreign forces”.On January1stMsLuo wentpubliconWeibo, a microbloggingsite. When MrChen denied the claims, MsLuo publishedtranscriptsofhim sayingthingslike “Can’tItouch you?” and “Then can youtouch mealittle?” On January11th the universityruled thatheraccusationswere true andsuspended MrChen.

Tian Dong, a law-yerwho specialisesin gender-relatedcases, saysthere isno legal deﬁnition ofsexual harassmentin China. Chinese com-paniesoften ignore harassmentin theirtermsofemploymentand training. Socialattitudeshave changed profoundlyin thepast30 years, buttraditional sexual rolesremain entrenched. Women are expectedto shutup and lookdemure. Astudyby theGuangzhouGenderCentre, an NGO,found thatalmost70% ofstudentssaidtheyhad been harassed. Fewerthan 4%said theyhad, oreverwould, reportas-saultsto the police.Above all, #WoYeShifacesthe Commu-nistParty—the mostpowerful organ ofwhich, the StandingCommittee ofthe Po-litburo, hasneverhad a female member.Given the party’singrained sexism andhostilityto anyform ofactivism, the sur-prisingthingisnotthat#WoYeShihashadlessimpactthan #MeToo.

Marriottsaid, “We absolutelywill notsupportanyseparatistorganisation thatwill undermineChina’ssovereigntyand territorial integrity.” Delta airlinesapol-ogised forhurtingthe feelingsofthe Chinese people. Zara, a Euro-pean fashion chain, even promised a “self-examination”.ForTaiwanese, itismore proofthatChina isoutto squeezethem until the pipssqueak. The CommunistPartyhasneverruled Taiwan, butconsidersita sacred mission to bring the islandunderitscontrol. China threatensforce should Taiwan formallydeclare thatitwill remain independentforever. The party viewseven “peaceful separation” asan abomination.China mixesbullyingwith blandishments. The bullying, ofwhich the move againstforeign websitesispart, ismeant toshrinkTaiwan’sdiplomaticspace and exertpsychological pres-sure.

Itviewsthe referen-dum lawasa step towardsa vote on independence. Ithas even at-tacked laudable newlegislation aimed atredressinghuman-rightsabusesthatoccurred duringthe yearsofKMT dictatorship.China seesthe bill asan attemptto erase all sense of a ChineseidentityamongTaiwanese: in those days, the KMT wasproud ofitsChinese nationalism, even though ithated the Communists.Above all, China isfuriouswith MsTsai forrefusingto acknowl-edge the “1992 consensus” between the two sides: thatboth Tai-wan and the mainland belongto a single China, and that theyagree to disagree whatexactlyChina means.So Taiwan isin the doghouse. Some policymakerswere re-lieved thatChina’sleader, Xi Jinping, did notsuggesthe would geteven tougherwith itwhen he spoke ata bigpartygathering in Oc-tober. Even so, hisuncompromisingremarksaboutTaiwan drewthe longestapplause ofanythinghe said. Soon afterthat meeting,he told PresidentDonald Trump thatTaiwan (notNorth Korea’snukes) wasthe mostcritical issue in Sino-American relations. MrXi talksofChina’s“greatrejuvenation” by2049. Thatsurelyim-pliesthe return ofTaiwan to the fold bythatdate.The pressure continues, then. On the diplomaticfront, the 20-strongband ofcountriesthatrecognise Taiwan isbound to bewhittled down further, followingPanama’sswitch to China lastyear—Honduras, Palauand StLucia could be next.

Forthree yearsitwasthe darling ofObamacare. GovernorSteve Beshear, arare Appalachian Democrat, compliedwith the reform bycreatinga statewidehealth-insurance exchange and expandingMedicaid (government-subsidised cover-age forthe poorand disabled). Between2013 and 2015, uninsured ratesforpooradultsfell from 40% to 9%—the biggestim-provementin the country. Butnowthat thestate isundernewmanagement—the Re-publican governor, MattBevin (picturedabove), isa Tea Partyfavourite—Kentuckymaysoon be notable in health-policycir-clesfora newreason: itwantsto becomethe ﬁrststate in historyto require someMedicaid recipientsto work.Otherstateswith Republican gover-nors, includingIndiana and Arkansas,hope to follow. Before long, the health-caresafetynetsin these statesmaylookverydiﬀerentfrom those in Democraticones—and indeed from those in otherrich coun-tries, where the poorestcitizensreceivehealth care with no stringsattached.The Trump administration approvedKentucky’ssweepingplan—which MrBev-in called “the mosttransformational enti-tlementreform...in a quarterofa cen-tury”—on January12th. The state willreceive an exemption from federal rulesgoverninghowMedicaid works. Suchwaiversare supposed to allowstatesto testalongwith a time limit, on Temporary As-sistance forNeedyFamilies(TANF), the re-branded governmentscheme. The theorywasthatTANFwould serve the trulyneedy, while the lazywould progressintolivesofself-suﬃciency. Forabouta decadethislooked like a greatsuccess. The num-berofclaimantsplunged by50% in fouryears. Overthe longerterm, the resultslooked lessgood. Short-term increases inemploymentdid notseem to translate intomarked improvementsin income.Requiringwork, volunteeringorstudyin exchange forMedicaid hasneverbeenattempted before, though. And there issome evidence that, ratherthan discourag-ingworkasmanyRepublicansclaim, Med-icaid incentivisestoil. AfterOhio expand-ed itsMedicaid programme, three outofeveryfourunemployed enrolleessaid thatgettingcoverage had made iteasierto seekwork. International comparisonsdo notsupportRepublicans’ argument, either.Manycountrieswith universal accesstohealth care have a higherproportion ofworking-age people in employmentthanAmerica does. (Alikelierproblem isthattakingawaybeneﬁtsaspeople earn moredisincentivisesjob advancement.)Republicanshave soughtto shrink wel-fare programmesfordecades, often sayingthattheyare unaﬀordable. Buttheir rea-sonsforreformingMedicaid seem to bemore aboutmoralitythan money. MrBev-in saysthatthe savingsmade do notmat-ter. Hisoﬃce addsthatthe rationale be-hind the plan was—confusingly—topromote “betterhealth outcomes”. Aspokesman forRand Paul, Kentucky’slib-ertarian Republican senator, saysthat“workshould notbe seen asa punish-ment, butasan opportunity”. Paul Ryan,the House Speaker, haswarned ofthe dan-gersofturningthe safety-netinto “a ham-mockthatlullsable-bodied people to lives experimental programmes“while preserv-ingorenhancingthe qualityofcare fur-nished”. YetKentuckyexpectsitsplan to re-duce the numberofMedicaid recipients by15%, suggestingthatthe administration isbendingthe rulesa little.The third freedomWhen the reform comesinto force in July,able-bodied adultsenrolled in Medicaidrisklosingtheirinsurance iftheydo notful-ﬁl a “communityengagement” require-ment—20 hoursofwork, job-seekingorvolunteeringeach week. Athicketofregu-lationswill determine preciselywho mustcomply; those in school ortakingcare ofafamilymemberwill be exempt. The stateexpectsthe newmandate to aﬀect350,000Kentuckians, halfofwhom alreadyhavejobs, and estimatesthatitwill shed 95,000from itsMedicaid programme. The impactcould be higherbecause prospective en-rolleeswill be deterred bythe sheer com-plexityofthe newrules, arguesSara Ro-senbaum ofGeorge WashingtonUniversity. Already, people need a lot ofnudgingto enroll. Ofthe 285,000 non-el-derlyKentuckianswho are still uninsured,43% are actuallyeligible forMedicaid buthave notsigned up.Addingworkrequirementsto Ameri-ca’ssafetynetisnota newidea.

Just 36%are non-disabled adults, and 60% ofthatgroup alreadywork. Those who are notworkingand notdisabled do notseem tobe lyingaboutin hammocks: 36% saytheyare ill, 30% take care ofa familymember,15% are in college, and so on. Atmost 10%, or1.4% ofall enrollees, could be said to lackanygood reason fornotworking. “I don’tneed added pressure to geta job, the pres-sure to survive isalreadyenough,” saysTa-jah McQueen, a catererin Louisville wholostherjob on December28th and appliedforMedicaid soon afterwards. She alreadypays$400 a month forherstudentloans,$2,000 forhermortgage and takescare ofatwo-year-old daughter.To weed outmalingerers, Kentucky isproposingto build an unwieldyadminis-trative apparatus. Thisbureaucraticlevia-than will enforce regulationsseeminglydesigned to catch outthe maximum num-berofrecipients. The state will begin bycollectingpremiums, capped at$15 permonth. Thiswould seem minimal, exceptthatto qualifyforMedicaid asa single per-son requiresan annual income ofless than$16,640. ForKentuckianswho gained cov-erage underthe Medicaid expansion, non-paymentofthese premiumsfortwomonthsresultsin a six-month lockout oncoverage—onlyto be restored afterpay-mentand attendance ofa “health-literacy”class. When Indiana setup a similarpro-gramme, 55% ofpeople had missed pay-mentswithin the ﬁrst21months, leavingthem with inferiorcoverage ornone at all.Participantsmustalso documenttheirworkon “atleast” a monthlybasis. Be-cause mostworkingMedicaid recipientsare in low-payingindustrieswith erraticscheduling, such asretailing, agriculture orconstruction, theymaynotfulﬁl the 20-hourrequirementin a week. Someonewho temporarilymakestoo much mon-ey—more than $320 a weekasa single per-son—mayriskgettingthe boot. Ofthe ten rural countiesin the countrywith the highestshare ofadultsenrolled inMedicaid, sixare in Kentucky. These areasare also the Trumpiest. There isa remark-ablystrongcorrelation in Kentuckybe-tween Medicaid enrolmentand supportforRepublicans(see chart). Duringthe1990s, racial animus, especiallythe notionthatlazyblackswere crowdingthe welfarerolls, wasshown to be especiallypowerfulin shapingattitudesto the safetynet. Yetthe people mostlikelyto suﬀerfrom theseneweﬀortsatreform are the poorwhiteswho helped send PresidentDonald Trumpto the White House.7#magaSources: Kentucky Cabinet for Healthand Family Services; US Census BureauUnited States, support for Donald Trump andMedicaid enrolment in Kentucky, by countyTrump support, % of votes in 2016 election0255075100025Medicaid enrolment, Dec 2017, % of population5075TRADITIONdictatesthatbad childrengetcoal in theirChristmasstockings.Butthe elaborate Christmasdisplayin theheadquartersofMurrayEnergyCorpora-tion, America’sbiggestprivatelyownedcoal ﬁrm, suggestsotherwise.

Ratherthan simplybuyingcoal from companieslike MurrayEnergy,astheydid fordecades, grid operators to-dayhave more choices. Natural gas—themostwidelyused fuel forelectricity gener-ation—and renewableshave been snatch-ingcoal’smarketshare. FrackinghasmadeAmerican natural gasabundantandcheap. The costofrenewables, especiallywind and solar, isalso falling. These twotrendshave caused coal’sdecline. ButMrMurrayprincipallyblames“theregulatoryrampage ofthe Democratparty”, driven bythe party’sprofessed be-liefin climate change—which, like MrTrump, he considers“a hoax”. Ithasbeenperpetrated, he contends, by“developingcountriesofthe world to getAmericandollars…[by] radical environmentalists…liberal elitists[and] Hollywood charac-ters.

Yet, bysome amazingcoincidence, hisactionplan—in addition to cuttingthe EPAstaﬀbyhalf, repealingthe Clean PowerPlan (anObama-era scheme to reduce greenhouse-gasemissionsfrom powerplants), andendingotherenvironmental rules—urgedthe administration to fund clean-coal tech-nologyand coalminers’ pensions.7WHENAmazon announced in 2010thatitwould build a distribution cen-tre in Lexington County, South Carolina,the decision washailed asa victoryfor thePalmetto State.

In the yearssince Am-azon opened itsdoorsin Lexington Coun-ty, annual earningsforwarehouse workersin the area have fallen from $47,000 to$32,000, a decline ofover30% (see chart1).Lexington Countyisnotalone. SinceAmazon opened a warehouse in Chester-ﬁeld, Virginia, warehouse wagesin the re-gion have fallen by17%. In Tracy, California,theyhave dropped by16%.

To getorderstocustomersasquicklyaspossible, the com-panyrelieson a vastnetworkofware-housesthe size ofaircraftcarrierswherethe companystoresitsproductsand pro-cessesorders. Amazon operatesmore than75 “fulﬁlmentcentres” and 35 sortingcen-tresin America, manned by125,000 full-time workers. To keep costsin check, Amazon mustnotonlymaintain dozensofwarehouses,butrun them eﬃciently. Whereastradi-tional shop workersmightremain idle forhoursata time, Amazon’sworkers—the“stowers” thatstockinventory, the “pick-ers” thatpluckitemsfrom shelvesand the“packers” thatboxthem up forshipment—are constantlymoving. Pickersareequipped with hand-held devicesthatshowthem whateach item lookslike,where itmaybe found, and howto getthere asquicklyaspossible. Asthey navi-gate rowafterrowofshelves, timers countdown the secondsneeded to retrieve eachitem. To meetperformance targets, pickersmustcollectasmanyas1,000 itemsandwalkup to 15 milesin a single shift.Accordingto available data from the Bu-reauofLabourStatistics(BLS) for35 coun-ties, warehouse workersin countieswhereAmazon operatesa fulﬁlmentcentre earnabout$41,000 peryear, compared with$45,000 peryearin the restofthe country,adiﬀerence ofnearly10% (see chart2). TheBLSdata also showthatin the ten quartersbefore the openingofa newAmazon cen-tre, local warehouse wagesincrease by anaverage of8%. In the ten quartersafter itsarrival, theyfall by3%. Whywould Amazon payitsemployeeslessthan otherﬁrmsin the industry? Mi-chael Mandel, an economistatthe Progres-sive PolicyInstitute, a think-tank, says itmaybe because the company’sware-housesare in areasthathave been “leftbe-hind”. Buton mosteconomicmeasures—includingwages, unemploymentand pov-erty—countieswith Amazon warehousesare no diﬀerentfrom the restofthe country.In fact, theyare generallybetter-oﬀ. Per-haps, suggestsDavid Autor, a labourecon-omistatMIT, Amazon’sworkersare youngand inexperienced. There issome evi-dence forthis. Amazon’semployeestendto be younger—data from the CensusBu-reausuggestthatnearlyhalfofitsware-house employeesare under35.

Kim Reynolds, the go-vernorofIowa, invited him asa keynotespeakerto a fund-raiser.In hishome state, however, MrGreitenshasfewerpolitical friendsand allies. De-nouncinglawmakersin Missouri with hisattackson “careerpoliticians” who have“turned Jeﬀerson Cityinto a corrupt, do-nothingembarrassment” did nothelp. Heisknown forberatingstate senatorsin priv-ate meetingsand he publiclyridiculed twoRepublican state senatorswho seemed tostand in the wayofhiseﬀortsto bring asteel mill to Missouri. Hisnon-proﬁt orga-nisation, ANewMissouri, ran adsattack-ingRob Schaaf, a Republican state senatorwho criticised MrGreitens’suse of“darkmoney”, orcampaign donationsfrom un-disclosed sources. The adseven disclosedMrSchaaf’smobile-phone number.“There isreal animositybetween thegovernorand some Republican lawmak-ers,” saysJohn Hancock, a formerchair-man ofthe GOPin Missouri. No Republi-can in the legislature defended MrGreitensthe dayafterthe newsabouthisextramar-ital aﬀair(which he admits) and the allega-tionsofblackmail (which he denies) wereaired on television. “Sticka forkin him,”tweeted SenatorSchaaf.

Awebsite called ericgreitensresign-.com iscollectingsignatories.Meanwhile, in neighbouringKansas,the KansasCityStar, hascalled forGover-norBrownback’sresignation “forthe goodofthe good people ofKansas”. In anticipa-tion ofhisambassadorial role MrBrown-backstarted to hand responsibilities to hislikelysuccessor, JeﬀColyer, a plastic sur-geon who islieutenant-governor.

He renewed the presidential waiv-erthatliftsnuclear-related sanctions onIran, butsignalled thatthiswasa ﬁnal re-prieve ratherthan a change ofheart. MrTrump sayshe wantsa newagree-mentto modifythe pactof2015 thatcurbedIran’snuclearprogramme, known astheJointComprehensive Plan ofAction(JCPOA), in return forlimited relief onsanctions. AmongMrTrump’sdemandsare endingthe expiryclausesin the agree-mentthat, forexample, allowIran after 15yearsto enrich uranium beyond the 3.67%normallyrequired forcommercial powerproduction; a ban on ballistic-missile test-ing; and unconstrained accessforInterna-tional AtomicEnergyAgencyinspectors toanymilitarysite, regardlessofwhetherthere hasbeen anyindication ofnuclearactivitythere.MrTrump hasnowtwice refused to re-certifythatIran isin compliance with thedeal (a requirementevery90 daysunderlegislation passed underthe Obama ad-ministration), despite all the evidence sug-gestingthatitis. Withouta desire on thepartofCongressto getinvolved, and therehasbeen little sign ofthat, decertiﬁcation ismore a gesture ofdeﬁance than a mortalthreatto the JCPOA. If, however, MrTrump The Iran nuclear agreementTrump cardDonald Trump gives his European allies 120 days to geta betterdeal34UnitedStatesThe EconomistJanuary20th20182unilaterallyreimposessanctions, Ameri-ca, asone ofsixsignatoriesto the dealalongwith Britain, France, Germany, Rus-sia and China, would be in clearbreach ofitscommitments. This, in turn, would re-lease Iran from itsobligations: allowing itto reinstate, ifitchose, those nuclear activ-itiesbanned underthe termsofthe JCPOA. Thisisan unfoldingnightmare for theEuropeans. Theyremain ﬁrmlycommittedto the painstakinglynegotiated deal (as areRussia and China), convinced thatits bene-ﬁtsvastlyoutweigh itsﬂaws. The day be-fore MrTrump’sannouncement, ata meet-ingin Brusselsofthe British, German andFrench foreign ministersthatwasattendedbytheirIranian opposite number, JavadZarif, theyreiterated theirunwavering sup-portforthe JCPOA. Theypointed outthatnobodyopposed to the deal hasproducedabetteralternative. Theydo notdeny that,in an ideal world, the thingsMrTrump isinsistingon would be nice to have. Buttheyﬁrmlyrejectthe idea thata superiordeal would have been possible ifonly theyand the Obama administration had beentougheron the Iranians.Even with an international sanctionsregime throttlingthe life outofthe Iranianeconomyand the possibilityofwarstillrumbling, the diplomatswho were therebelieve thatthe Iranian negotiatingteamcould nothave been pushed furtherwith-outbeingrepudiated byhardlinersathome, includingthe supreme leader, AliKhamenei. With no international supportforthe reimposition ofnuclear-relatedsanctions, the Europeansregard itas fanta-syto suppose thatthe Iranianswould nowbowto demandsfrom MrTrump thatre-late more to rash campaign promisesthanreal-world diplomacy. The presidenthasnonethelessmade itclearthathe expectsAmerica’sEuropeanalliesto help him getwhathe wants. “Ifothernationsfail to actduringthis time,”he declared, “I will terminate ourdeal withIran.” Both the French and the British, ea-gerto showwilling, saytheytoo are keento discussfollow-on agreementswith Iranaboutmissile developmentand regionalinterference. Buttheymaintain thatanysuch talksshould be open-ended and notlinked to the JCPOA, which isachieving ex-actlywhatitsetoutto do.

Hermotherhad made the clan-destine journeyfrom theirnative Guatemala, lookingfor worktohelp payforJennifer’sleukaemia treatment, ﬁve yearsearlier.Havingestablished herselfin Maryland, cleaninghouses and car-ingforchildren, she wanted herson and two daughters—includ-ingJennifer, bythen sixand cancer-free—with her. “All I remem-berisstaringatthe moon,” Jenniferrecalls. “So longasI could seeit, I thoughtwe’d be OK.”Nowin herlastyearofhigh school in Maryland, Jennifer isthecommanderofherschool’saircadetsand hasbeen oﬀered aplace bysixcolleges.

She isone ofthe 700,000 beneﬁciariesofan Obama-era programme, known byitsacronym DACA, thatshieldsillegal immigrantsbroughtto America aschildren fromdeportation; butwhich PresidentDonald Trump hasended. Theprogramme isdue to lapse on March 5th, leavingitsbeneﬁciaries,known as“Dreamers”, liable forexpulsion. Thiswould be so ob-viouslycounter-productive thatonlya seriouslydysfunctionalgovernmentcould countenance it.In otherwords, Jenniferisrightto be worried.MrTrump sayshe islegallycompelled to axe DACA, whichmostRepublicansregarded asan actofexecutive overreach, andwantsCongressto passa lawto protectthe Dreamers. Yet he alsoseesthatasan opportunityto extractsupportforhisrestrictionistagenda from the Democrats, who are dedicated to savingtheDreamersand whose votesare needed to do so. So MrTrump isdemandingbillionsofdollarsforhispromised borderwall, aswell aschangesto legal immigration, which he and other Repub-lican hawkswantto cutbyhalf. The Democratssay: no way. Andwith a rare momentofleverage loomingforthe minority party, inthe form ofa spendingbill required to keep the federal govern-mentrunningbeyond January19th, theyare demandingthatthefate ofDreamersshould be secured ﬁrst. Thatseemsambitious.Though the Dreamerswill probablybe saved eventually—be-cause around 85% ofAmericanswantthem to be—the stand-oﬀhasdegenerated into an uglyrowoverMrTrump’sreference toHaiti and African countries, ata bipartisan meetingon immigra-tion, as“shitholes”. Moreover, in anyevent, the farrago will havesucked up vastamountsofcongressional time, caused needlessanxietyto those aﬀected (including, Jenniferestimates, a third ofherschool’s200 aircadets) and perhapsa governmentshutdowncostingbillionsin losteconomicactivity.ThatAmerica isin a ﬁxoverimmigration isperhapsunsur-prising. Through itshistory, periodsofhigh immigration have al-waysprovoked a backlash—thus, the restrictive measures passedin the early1920safteran inﬂuxfrom southern and eastern Eu-rope, and again in the early1960s, to expel thousandsoflow-skilled Mexicans. Itisa cycle asAmerican asthe opportunity thecountryotherwise aﬀordsimmigrants. Afteranothergreat in-wash ofHispanics, peakingduringthe late 1990sataround750,000 arrivalsa year, a repulse wasinevitable. Only thistime itisdiﬀerent. Anti-immigration movementshave in the past beenasmuch within the partiesasbetween them, the backlash havingtraditionallybeen led byleft-wingunionsand right-wing nativ-ists. Yetthisrowispartisan, makingitsymbolicallyimportant tothe parties, liable to getpersonal, and correspondingly intracta-ble. Forthe same reasons, the political discussion ofimmigrationhasbecome increasinglyremoved from reality. Employment inlow-skilled jobswill growfasteroverthe nextdecade than thenumberofnative workers. Byleavingmillionsoflong-stay immi-grantsin the shadows, America isinﬂictinga vastopportunitycoston itself. Moreover, perhapsin partasa response to MrTrump, immigration isbecomingmuch lessunpopular.In both parties, fundamental forceshave shaped thispoliticalchange. Onlya decade ago, Republican leaderssuch asGeorge W.Bush enthused aboutimmigration. Yettheywere outoftouchwith the nativism ofmanyRepublican voters. Thatsentiment,which MrTrump divined and hasexacerbated, hasnowinfectedthe partyto such a degree thathostilityto immigration isthe sur-estindicatorofRepublican support. The arrival ofmany Hispan-icsin Republican stateswhich had previouslyseen little recentimmigration, such asAlabama and Arkansas, isone reason forthis. Anotheristhe electoral migration ofworking-class whitesfrom the Democrats—bringingwith them the left’straditionalfearforthe eﬀectofimmigration on native workers’ wages. In ad-dition, Republicans’ fearsare driven, opinion pollingand MrTrump’srhetoricsuggests, byethnocultural anxietywhich, in acountryturningrapidlybrowner, cannoteasilybe assuaged. In with the outcrowdMeanwhile, the Democrats, who until a decade orso ago weresimilarlydivided on immigration, are nowall forit. In 2006, 40%ofDemocratswere in favourofa borderwall; nowlessthan 10%are. Thisisin partbecause the partyhasto some degree replaceditslostwhiteswith Hispanicvoters. Italso represents a more pro-found cultural shift, driven bya cosmopolitan relish for diversityand zeitgeistyaversion to chauvinism, such thateven whiteDemocratsnowfeel markedlylesscharytowardsimmigrationthan theydid. To be pro-immigrantisbecomingeven more inher-entlyDemocraticthan to be agin immigration isRepublican.Thisisunhelpful foranyone who wantsto improve America’simmigration policies. And thatincludesthe publicatlarge, whichisto the centre ofboth partieson the issue.

Thismonth MrMacri allowed the expi-ration ofa 16-year-old economic-emergen-cylaw, which gave the presidentspecialpowersoverdebt, taxesand the exchangerate. Itsdemise issupposed to be a quietsignal thatthe ruinousdecadesofpopu-lism and instabilityare over, and that Ar-gentina meansto reclaim the European-level prosperityitenjoyed a century ago. Abalancing actWith the governmentstill knee-deep in themessmade bythe Kirchnersand theirpre-decessors, thatgoal seemsfaraway. Mid-waythrough hisﬁrstterm, MrMacri hasbarelybegun to solve some ofthe biggestproblemsthatenterprisesface, points outGabriel Brener, the bossofCher, a chain ofclothingshops. Decadesofprotection havesapped the competitive energiesofArgen-tine industries. Trade barriersare seventimeshigherthan the average foremergingmarkets, accordingto the IMF.

Aftera faststart, Mr Macrihasslowed the pace ofreforms. Ifhe can-notﬁnish the job, MrManzuoli fears, Ar-gentina’seconomywill notprosper. Aftertakingoﬃce in December2015, MrMacri ﬂoated the peso, scrapped most tax-eson exportsand reduced energyand tran-sportsubsidiesin an eﬀortto restrain a ris-ingbudgetdeﬁcit(see charton next page).He introduced targetsforpublicborrow-ing, settled a long-runningdispute withforeign creditors, which restored Argenti-na’saccessto international capital mar-kets, and gave hisblessingto inﬂation tar-getingbythe central bank.The economyisnowmovingin therightdirection.

To give himselfa chance to write thesecond draft, MrMacri ispursuingpoliciesthatseekto balance economicstabilitywith the need to placate groupsthatcoulddisrupthispresidencyand thwarthis re-election. Argentina paysan economicprice forthiscaution in the form of high in-terestrates, weakexportsand a rising debtburden. IfMrMacri misjudges, and lets theprice rise too high, he could undermine theeconomicrevival thathe haspromised tobringabout.Hismain macroeconomicdecision hasbeen to reduce the budgetdeﬁcitgraduallyratherthan abruptly. The word “adjust-ment” istaboo, saysan oﬃcial in the trea-surydepartment. The pension reform,which provoked shovingon the ﬂoorofcongressaswell asclasheswith police out-side it, isexpected to save the governmentthe equivalentof0.5% ofGDPthisyear.Thatisa good start, butthe governmenthasto go further, forexample bymakingsure thatcontributionscovera bigger pro-portion ofbeneﬁts, arguesthe IMF. MrMa-cri did notoﬀsetthe corporate taxcut withrevenuesfrom othersources. Hisreluctance to slam on the ﬁscalbrakeshasshifted responsibilityfor con-trollinginﬂation, still a painful 25%, ontothe central bank. Itshigh interestrates haveslowed economicgrowth and encouragedforeign investorsto buyArgentine bonds,drawingin capital thathaspushed up thevalue ofthe peso. Thatin turn hasmade ex-portslesscompetitive and widened thecurrent-accountdeﬁcit. Arelatively strongcurrencyhasdiscouraged foreign investorsfrom riskingmoneyin job-creatingenter-prisesorthe infrastructure thatArgentinadesperatelyneeds. The IMFhasurged thegovernmentto seta more ambitiousﬁscalgoal ofeliminatingthe deﬁcitbefore inter-estpaymentsby2019. Ratherthan do that, the governmenthasdecided to accepta higherinﬂation ratethan ithad planned. On December28ththe treasuryannounced thatthe centralbank’sinﬂation targetin 2018 would be 15%ratherthan 8-12%, which meansthatinter-estratescan be lowerthan theywouldhave been. The peso quicklydropped by4%(though ithassince recovered a bit). The central bank’soriginal targetwastoo ambitious, so itmakessense to revise it(even the newone maybe hard toachieve). Butthere isa cost. Inﬂation hurtsthe poormost. Some economistsworrythatthe governmentisteachingpeople toexpecthigherinﬂation, which often causesitto happen. The central bankshares thatworry. On January9th itlowered ratesby0.75 percentage points, a bitlessthan mar-ketshad anticipated, to 28%. Although orthodoxeconomistsgrum-ble aboutMrMacri’sgradualism, Argen-tine investorsseem to endorse it. Private in-vestmentisrecoveringaftera decline in2016, though itisstill lowerthan it shouldbe. Itrose 16% lastyearand isexpected togrowby14% in 2018. Foreign investorsof-ten followthe lead oflocal ones, points outDante Sica ofAbeceb, an economicconsul-tancy. Before Cambiemos’selection vic-toryin October, the rate ofreturn demand-ed byforeign investorsin Argentineinfrastructure and energywasdoublewhatprojectsin otherLatin Americancountriespaid, MrSica says. Ithassincedropped to the same level. Investorsare bettingthatMrMacri andhispartycan win again in national elec-tionsin 2019. There isa good chance of that,in partbecause more votersstill blame theKirchnersforArgentina’seconomicplightthan blame MrMacri. He will then have achance to use the ﬁnal term he isallowedin oﬃce to modernise Argentina’secon-omy. MrManzuoli, sittingbeside menusthatdisplayGuapaletas’s41ﬂavours,soundsmore optimisticthan fearful.

One wassustained protest. Thatwasmetwith violence: about120 peopledied in protestslastyear, manyat thehandsofthe securityforces. Despite theprotests, MrMaduro created a new, hand-picked assemblyto replace the parlia-ment. (The opposition boycotted a vote inJulythatwasintended to give this newbodya ﬁgleafofrespectability.)The second trackhasbeen to tryto ne-gotiate with the regime fora free and fairpresidential election due laterthis year. Intheorythe two strategiesare notincom-patible, butin practice pursuitof both hasdivided the opposition (which haspaid ahigh price foritsfailure to forge a singlepartywith a single leader). Those splitsand the regime’sreﬁnementoffraud andclientelism—votesforfood and cash—al-lowed MrMaduro to win the recentre-gional and municipal elections.

Thebodyhad alreadymade itknown thatcele-bratingthe newyear, playingthe lottery,feedingdogsathome, and purchasingBit-coin were incompatible with the princi-plesofIslam; men should notdye theirmoustaches, norcoupleshold hands. (Di-vorcingone’sspouse bytextmessage,however, isOK.) Butwhen the Diyanet de-clared, in a glossaryentryspotted on itswebsite atthe startofthisyear, that accord-ingto Islamiclawgirlsasyoungasninewere able to marry, the ensuingoutcry wasbiggerthan in recentmemory. Some criticscalled forthe institution to close. The Diya-netprotested thatitwasonlycataloguing,notendorsing, principleslaid down by Is-lamicjurists, and soundlycondemnedchild marriage in a sermon. (The legal agein Turkeyis18.) The oﬀendingpostwastak-en down.To criticsofthe Diyanetthe incident,the latestin a seriesofcontroversies, of-fered yetmore evidence ofthe directorate’stransformation. Overthe pastdecade, andespeciallyamid the purgesthatfollowed acoup attemptin 2016, Turkey’spresidentRecep Tayyip Erdogan and hisIslamist-rooted Justice and Development(AK)partyhave tightened theirgrip on state in-stitutions, restrictingdissentwithin andwithout. The Diyanethasbeen no excep-tion. Designed asa checkagainstpoliticalIslam, the directorate hasbecome one ofitsmain platforms. In constitutional terms, Turkeyis a secu-larcountry. Butwhereasin mostplaces thisimpliesthe separation ofreligion and state,in Turkeyitmeansstate control over reli-gion. Enterthe Diyanet.

Formostofitshistory, the Diyanet hasaccommodated the politicsofthe secularestablishment, embracinga version of Is-lam atease with modernity, and keepingfundamentalism atbay. (Supportforshariain Turkeyisconsiderablylowerthan inmostofthe Muslim world.) UnderAK,however, itseemslessbound bysecularnormsthan everbefore. “The Diyanetoftodayhasa more Islamist, more Arabworldview,” saysMustafa Cagrici, the muf-ti ofIstanbul from 2003 to 2011. Much ofthishasto do with the inﬂuxofhardline in-terpretationsofIslam from abroad andTurkey’sbuddingrelationswith foreign Is-lamistgroups. Despite a fewearlysignsto the contrary,the moderate, critical currentwithin theDiyanethasfolded underincreasingpres-sure from hardliners. In 2004 the Diyanetannounced a projectto verifyand reinter-pretthe hadith, orthe collected wordsandactsofthe ProphetMuhammad, in a mod-ern light. Followinggrumblingsbypower-ful Islamicbrotherhoodsand conserva-tivesinside AK, the fruitofthe Diyanet’slabours, a seven-volume studyfarless am-bitiousthan itsdesignersintended, took adecade to appear, and did so to minimalfanfare. Asked ifa similarprojectmighteven be started today, MrCagrici throwsbackhishead. “No way,” he says. The Diya-netisbigger(itemploys117,000 people)and wealthier(itsbudgethasgrown atleastfourfold since 2006) than atanytimein itshistory, butitisalso more ﬁrmly un-derthe government’sthumb.Foralmosta century, the Diyanet haswalked a ﬁne line to help safeguard Tur-key’sidentityasa countrythatisboth Mus-lim and secular.

Forthatishowitworks, is itnot?No, itisnot. Atleastnotwhen the EU’sbudgetisinvolved. In afewmonthsthe club’sgovernmentswill begin formal talks onthe next“multiannual ﬁnancial framework” (MFF), a drab formu-lation thatconcealsthe diplomaticrancouritsnegotiation willspawn. The sumsare notlarge: thisyearthe EUwill spend €145bn($177bn), about1% ofitsGDP. Butthe meansofthe MFF’sconstruc-tion guarantee thatblood will be spilled. Within countries thereare prime ministersto mediate spendingdisputesamongsquab-blingdepartmentheads, butthe EUhasno primusinterpares; thebudgetmustbe approved unanimouslybyitsleaders. Itwill cov-erﬁve, orperhapsseven, years, from 2021. Because the EU maynotrackup deﬁcitsorraise substantial fundsitself, everynegotia-tion becomesa zero-sum game between rich and poormemberstates. One formerambassadorrecallsthe ﬁerce atmosphere sur-roundingEUbudgetarynegotiations. The friendlydiplomats hehad gotto knowovertrade and agricultural negotiations weretransformed overnightinto crazed money-grubbingvampireswith euro signsforeyes.EveryEuropean budgetarynegotiation isunhappyin its ownway. Thisyear’s, though, promisesa singularpageantofmisery,forthree reasons. First, the departure ofBritain, one ofthe largestcontributors, will leave a €12bn hole in the annual budget. Thiswill have to be made whole byspendingcuts, extra demands onwealthycountriesora mixofthe two, assuggested bythe Euro-pean Commission (which will issue a budgetaryproposal forgovernmentsto discussin May). Second, newmoneymustbefound forareasin which the EUwantsto do more, such asmigra-tion and security—which could mean thatlessgoesto “cohesion”fundsforinfrastructure in eastern Europe. Third, and knottiest ofall, some governmentsare warmingto the idea ofweaponisingthe budgetto resolve some ofthe EU’smostintractable disputes. One problem ishowto manage whatoﬃcialscall the “inter-nal dimension” ofimmigration: sharingrefugeesamongEUcountriesto lessen the burden on front-line stateslike ItalyandGreece, aswell asthe common destinationsofGermanyandSweden. Manycountries, particularlyin eastern Europe, see refu-gee quotasasan attackon theirsovereign rightto determine whomaylive on theirterritory. Thistiresome issue hasconsumed theEU formore than two years. Ithasbroughtforth legal proceed-ings, umpteen recalibrationsofquota formulae and a string ofbad-tempered summits(the mostrecentin December). Nothinghasworked. The threatto withdrawsubsidiesfrom countries thatrefuse to take in refugeeshasloomed since 2015; itisnowin fullview. The Dutch coalition agreement, signed in October, explicit-lycommitsthe newgovernmentto thatgoal. Asecond diﬃcultyconcernsthe rule oflaw. Attacks on the ju-diciaryand otherindependentinstitutions, especiallyin Polandand Hungary, have forced the EU to confrontthe impossible ques-tion ofhowto deal with governmentsthatviolate their EUtreatypromisesto uphold the independence ofinstitutions. The com-mission, in itsrole asguardian ofthe EU treaties, hasopened pro-ceedingsagainstthe Polish governmentunderArticle 7 ofthe Lis-bon treaty, which in extremiscould see Poland stripped ofitsvotingrightsbythe othergovernments. The political and legalobstaclesto thatlookinsurmountable. ButPoland receives moresupportfrom the EU budgetthan anyothermember. Whynot hititin the pocket?Both issuesfurrowbrows, butthe second posesthe harderquestions. The migration rowisa legacyofthe crisisof 2015-16, asquabble overa relativelysmall numberofrefugeesthat govern-mentsmayyetbe able to resolve. The rule-of-lawquestions aretrickier. The French and German governmentshave diﬀerent vi-sionsforthe EU, buton “values” the pairseem asone: commit-mentto the rule oflawisnotup fornegotiation. Emmanuel Mac-ron, France’spresident, made the case aspartofa speechexpressinghisvision forEurope in September. He hassince at-tacked countriesthatuse EUsubsidiesto fund taxcuts. (His targetappeared to be Hungary.) Germanytreadsmore carefullywherePoland isconcerned, butlastweek’spreliminarycoalition agree-mentbetween itstwo largestpolitical partiessaid delicately thatthe rule oflawinside the EUshould be “enforced more consis-tentlythan hasbeen the case”. In yourhead, theyare ﬁghtingItishard to see whatcould do the enforcingexceptthe budget.Several European commissioners, includingGüntherOettinger,who overseesthe MFF, have suggested linkingpaymentsto as-sessmentsofthe rule oflaw. The idea hasbeen discussed in capi-talsacrossthe EU, includingBerlin. To withhold fundsfrom coun-trieswith compromised judiciariesorbentadministrations isnopunishment, the argumentruns; merelythe prudentmanage-mentoftaxpayers’ money.Thatthesisclearlywill notﬂyin those countrieswhich standto lose out. Some othergovernmentsare wary, too. None wishesto ﬁnd itselfnextin the line ofﬁre. Itishardlyclear howsuch bud-getarysanctionswould work, and who would police them. Butin unguarded moments, some oﬃcialsnote thatmoneyhas awayofreachingthe partsthatpolitical pressure orlegal threatscannot. Eitherway, the stage issetfora bitterrow.

Such werejusta fewofthe immediate consequencesofthe collapse thatmorningofCarillion,Britain’ssecond-largestconstruction ﬁrm,with debtsofabout£1bn ($1.4bn) and pen-sion liabilitiesofalmostasmuch again. The total costin lostjobsand businesshasyetto be counted. Butanothercasualtyofthe company’scapsize maybe the busi-nessmodel thatwentso badlywrongthere, and which plentyofotherﬁrms inthe outsourcingindustryshare.Carillion employed 43,000 peopleworldwide, almosthalfofthem in Britain.Itbegan asa construction company, build-ingeverythingfrom the doughnut-shapedheadquartersofGCHQ, Britain’ssignal-in-telligence agency, to hospitalsand footballstadiums. Itlaterbegan providingall man-nerofservicesforboth the publicand priv-ate sectors, dishingup mealsin schools,maintainingbasesforthe Ministryof De-fence, and much else. Manyofitsprojectswere commissioned underthe Private Fi-nance Initiative (PFI), in which contractorsfootthe costofbuildingand are repaid bythe governmentoverseveral decades. Al-mostall the workthatCarillion won wasthe buildingtrade. In Liverpool, for in-stance, workersfound asbestoson site andcracksappeared in the newbuilding. Un-derthe termsofthe deals, Carillion had toabsorb the extra costs, on projectsthatwere barelyproﬁtable in the ﬁrstplace. Thecompanyalso ran into trouble in Qatar,where itgotinto a dispute overa paymentof£200m thatitwasowed forworkon the2022 World Cup. The resultwasa proﬁtwarninglastJuly, afterthe companyadmit-ted to unexpected over-runsof£845m,which sentthe share price tumbling. Caril-lion continued to win business, notablyfrom the government, which awarded it acontractfor£1.4bn ofworkon the HS2 rail-wayeven asinvestorsbeton the ﬁrm’scol-lapse. Butaftermore proﬁtwarnings, thebanksrefused to lend itanymore.Public-sectortendersare supposed toconsiderthe qualityofbidsaswell as theprice, butin practice contractorshavefound that“biddingata lowprice isusual-lythe bestwayto win,” saysPeterKitson, alawyeratRussell-Cooke. Companiesbankthe upfrontpaymentsand hope theycanmake moneybychargingforthe extraworkthatnearlyalwayscomeswith infra-structure projects. If, ashappened to Caril-lion, extra costsarise, the deal can quicklybecome loss-making.ButCarillion’smanagementwasalsoculpable. The ﬁrm expanded too fast, ac-quiringbusinessesthatitdid notunder-stand. Itpaid £306m forEaga, forinstance, asupplierofgreen-energyproducts, onlymonthsbefore the governmentcutsubsi-diesthathomeownersgotforinstalling so-larpanels. AsCarillion wasfailingand itspension fund slippinginto deﬁcit(see nextstory), shareholderscontinued to receivedividendsand the ﬁrm’sbosstrousered a£1.5m paypackage. Even the Institute of Di-rectors, a businesslobby, condemned Ca-rillion’sboard forrewritingcompanyrulesoutsourced to subcontractors, who wouldoften sub-subcontractitin turn.The platoonsofsmall ﬁrmsthatdidmostofCarillion’sworkwill thusbe mostaﬀected byitsdemise. Rudi Klein, head ofthe SpecialistEngineeringContractors’Group, representingthousandsofengi-neeringﬁrms, estimatesthatCarillionowed about£2bn to 30,000 orso ﬁrms.Thatdoesnotinclude the unknown cost ofretentions, the cash thatCarillion washoldingbackuntil companieshad ﬁnishedthe job. Manywill nevergettheirmoney,damagingBritain’sslendersupplychain.Atleastthe governmenthasstepped in toprotectthose doingpublic-sectorwork; Ca-rillion had about450 governmentcon-tracts, constitutingabouta third of thecompany’srevenuesin 2016. Butitwasthisworkthatcontributed toCarillion’sundoing, highlightingthe basicﬂawin itsbusinessmodel. Construction isaperilouslylow-margin businessto beginwith. To expand the businessand keepenough cash rollingin to paycreditors andshareholders, Carillion’sbossesbid evermore aggressivelyforpublic-sectorcon-tracts, especiallyin the wake ofthe ﬁnan-cial crash in 2008, when such workwasscarce. Thatiswhen three bigdealsweresigned thathave gone sour: to build hospi-talsin Liverpool and Birmingham, togeth-erworth £685m, and fora share in a £550mroadbuildingcontractin Aberdeen.All three projectshitsnagscommon toThe collapse of CarillionCleaned outThe mega-contractor’s demise reveals an outsourcing model in need ofa revampBritainAlso in this section49The tabloid Guardian49Carillion’s pensions50Bagehot: The special relationshipThe EconomistJanuary20th2018 Britain492to protectexecutives’ bonusesifthe com-panyfailed.

None ofthisapplies toworkerswith a deﬁned contribution pen-sion, where beneﬁtsare notpromised bythe company; theirpension potswill becompletelyuntouched.Carillion hasa complexstructure cov-ering14 diﬀerentpension schemes. If all ofthem end up with the PPF, the fund maybeon the hookforalmost£900m. Thatwouldbe the biggestsingle claim yeton thescheme, which wassetup in 2005.

The Americanpresidenthimselfhad been lined up to cutthe ribbon on the bil-lion-dollarbuilding. The media had been primed to produce arti-clesaboutthe embassy’scleverfeatures(a reﬂective pool thatdoublesasa defensive moat!) and eye-catchingdesign. But thenDonald Trump pulled outofthe ceremonyon the groundsthatthe newembassywasin an “oﬀlocation”, and, prompted byEm-manuel Macron’soﬀerto lend Britain the Bayeuxtapestry, themedia shifted itsattention to the wondersofthe entente cordiale.Itistemptingto see the embassyﬁasco asa metaphor forthestate ofAnglo-American relations. The special relationship ismore importantnowthan ithasbeen since the fall ofthe BerlinWall. The obviousreason forthisisBrexit: there would be no bet-terwayto getBritain’spost-European future oﬀto a good startthan to strike a trade deal with the world’sbiggesteconomy.There isalso a subtlerreason. Britain and America are both liberalchampionsthathave been shaken bypopulism. Strengtheningtheirties, which were forged in warsagainstNazism and thencommunism, isa good wayofremindingboth countriesof theircommon liberal heritage.Butatthe same time the special relationship hasnever beenmore imperilled. Itwasshaken bythe Iraq war, which associatedthe relationship notwith national liberation butwith lies, incom-petence and strategicdisaster. Nowitisbeingrattled again bytheaccidental axisofDonald Trump and JeremyCorbyn. Eversince Theresa Maybarged herwayto the frontof thequeue offoreign leaderswaitingto paycourtto the newly electedpresident, holdinghishand and promisinga state visit with allthe trimmings, MrTrump hasbeen nothingbuttrouble. He haspromised to provide the prime ministerwith herall-importanttrade deal, buthasdone nothingto turn hotairinto boring oldpolicy.

Whatcan be done to revive the special relationship in suchdiﬃcultcircumstances? Partofthe answerliesin patience. How-everlarge theyloom today, MessrsTrump and Corbyn will even-tuallybe gone. Partofitliesin workarounds—thatis, dealingdi-rectlywith sensible people like H.R. McMaster, America’snational securityadviser. And partliesin opportunism. The rela-tionship’sfriendsneed to seize on whatevershowsitin a goodlight, in orderto counteractthe damage thatisbeingdone. Butthemostimportantanswerliesin realism.One problem forthe special relationship isthatpeople expecttoo much from it.

Right-wingToriessuch asLiam Fox,the secretaryforinternational trade, wantto use America asacounterbalance to Euro-socialism and to use a trade deal withAmerica asa buildingblockforthe “Anglosphere”. ButAmericantrade negotiatorsare some ofthe toughestin the business. Andthe United Statesisa global powerwith an increasingly diversepopulation. America meansa lotmore to Britain than Britainmeansto America.The specialestever, I guarantee itButitisalso dangerousto expecttoo little. Since the Iraq debacle,ithasbeen fashionable to argue thatthe special relationship isadangerousillusion sustained byBritain’snostalgicdesire topunch above itsweightand America’slikingforyes-men. This ismistaken. The Anglo-American relationship isspecial because itisboth deeperand broaderthan almostanyotherbilateral one.Deeperbecause America hasborrowed so much from Britain,from common law, to joint-stockcompanies, to a version oftheEnglish language. Broaderbecause the countrieshave intimaterelationson everyfront, from economic, to cultural, to military.The intelligence relationship isparticularlyclose, with the twocountriessharingsensitive information and co-operating on newthreatssuch ascyber-terrorism.

Ithas been repeat-edlyreinvented ascommunism, and then terrorism, tookoverfrom Nazism asthe main threatto the world order. Itneeds to beupdated once again. The British and Americansmustrecognisethattheyshare common historiesand idealsthatare far too deepto be dislodged bya pairofpopinjays.

The UN had ex-pected to demobilise 38,000 ﬁghters. In theend the numberwasmore than 100,000—fourtimesasmanyasthe numberofweap-onshanded in. Men were bussed in fromSierra Leone.

In 2009 itsarmydefeated the Liberation TigersofTamil Eelam (LTTE; also known asthe Tam-il Tigers). Itwasthe brutal culmination of26 yearsofcivil war. The Tigersweretrapped in designated no-ﬁre zones, wheretheywere bombed with the civilianstheyhad taken ashuman shields. The 11,000survivingﬁghters, and another1,000 orsowho had surrendered, were forced into re-habilitation, beginningin 2010. Butthe programme mainlyconsisted ofayearofinternmentand indoctrination.Still constantlymonitored, the formerﬁghtersare isolated from theircommuni-tiesand struggle to ﬁnd work, since poten-tial employersfearattractingattentionfrom the authorities. Though the armyclaimsitprovided trainingand psycholog-ical help, formerTigerssaythatthese most-lyfocused on attemptsto end theirdevo-tion to the LTTE. “We were nottreated likenormal human beings,” saysone, wholivesin Kilinochchi, a formerstronghold ofthe Tigersin the north ofSri Lanka. “Theytried to make usregrethavingbeen withthe LTTE. Buttheycouldn’tdo it.” The trainingwasoften pointlessor in-appropriate. “Someone [who] used to farmten or11acres, theyteach to make handi-craftswith coconutshells,” saysVettichelli,who spent18 yearsin the Tamil Tigers.

ButDDR schemescan rarelygive it. Theyare generallyrun byex-mili-tarytypes, notspecialistsin economic de-velopmentorcounselling. And a long-run-ningprogramme risksturninginto aprotection racket.

Manystartupswill tryto ride the trend, as will in-cumbentssuch ashardware makers. Butthe real ﬁghtwill be overwho colonisesthe edge and, in particular, which ﬁrmswill control the “internetofthings” (IoT),asconnected devicesare collectivelycalled.

Firmswantto use data but, worryingaboutleaks,often preferto keep theirown informationinhouse. Consumers, fortheirpart, careaboutprivacy, which Bragi hopesto ad-dresswith itsself-suﬃcientearplugs. The dominantnarrative in the tech in-dustry—thatmostdata are bestcrunchedcentrallyin the cloud—isalso underminedbythe factthatmanynewapplicationshave to actfast.

Manywould guesseitherAma-zon orGoogle, which operate the world’slargestnetworksofdata centres, but thecorrectanswerisAlibaba. In 2016 thecloud-computingbusinessofthe Chinesee-commerce behemoth grewby126%, to$675m. Growth isunlikelyto slowsoon. Si-mon Hu, presidentofAlibaba Cloud,wantsitto “match orsurpass” AmazonWeb Services(AWS) by2019.Thatisa stretch: AWSisestimated tohave generated revenuesofabout$17bn in2017. ButAlibaba’scloud (known locallyasAliyun) isone ofa thrivinggroup: China’scloud-computingindustryasa whole isgrowingrapidly. Even more intriguing thanitsspeedyexpansion isthe factthat Chi-na’scloud isdiﬀerentto thatofWesternﬁrmsin importantways.The technologythatChina’scloud-computingprovidersuse isnotso dissimi-lar. Indeed, the factthatWestern tech ﬁrmshave released much ofthe necessarycodeasopen-source software made iteasier forthem to getgoing. “Thatbroughtusto thesame starting-line,” saysXilun Chen, thechiefexecutive ofEasyStack, which buildscloudsformanyChinese ﬁrms.Whatvariesishowthe technology isused—a resultofthe respective roots ofcloud computing. In the Westthe ﬁrst cus-tomerswere startupsand onlylater, biggerﬁrms. In China the cloud grewoutof con-sumerservices, includingTaobao, Ali-baba’se-commerce marketplace, and theonline gamesoﬀered byTencent, thesec-ond-biggestonline ﬁrm. Asa result, manycloud servicesare notyetreadyforcom-plex, mainstream corporate applications,saysEvan ZengofGartner, a research ﬁrm. Asthese servicesdevelop, however,there ishuge potential. In the Westalmostall ﬁrmshave longhad sophisticated in-house information-technologysystems,which manyare hesitantto abandon. Incontrast, the ITofmostChinese companiesisunderdeveloped. “Theycan jump di-rectlyto the cloud,” saysJi Xinhua, thefounderand chiefexecutive ofUCloud, asmallerbutfast-growingcloud provider.Anotherdivergence stemsfrom regula-tion. Whereasin the Westorganisationssuch asgovernmentagenciesand ﬁnancialﬁrmsoften share data centreswith othercustomers, in China there are separate “in-dustryclouds”. Banks, forinstance, are en-couraged to sign up forservicesprovidedbyoutﬁtssuch asCIBFinTech, a spin-oﬀfrom China’sIndustrial Bank, because it re-ﬂectsthe latestregulationsand makesthings“more convenient” forregulators, inthe wordsofitsboss, ChongChen. And whereasAWS, Microsoftand Goo-gle alreadyrule the Western roost, theeventual cloud leadersin China are as yetunknown. Alibaba, China Telecom andTencentare ahead (see charton nextpage),butthatcould change, saysMrZeng. Hua-wei, a makeroftelecomsgear, hasambi-tiousplans. Smallerplayers, such asUCloud, maycatch up. Whicheverﬁrm endsup leading, Chi-nese and Western cloud providersarebound to run into each other—though notso much in theirhome countriesasin suchplacesasEurope and India. AWSand itsmain rivalshave been busybuildingdatacentresabroad forsome time, including inChina. ButAlibaba and Tencentare catch-ingup. Alibaba, forexample, operates adozen computingplantsabroad and willopen anotherone thismonth in India, nearMumbai. “We have taken on Amazon onall fronts,” saysAlibaba’sMrHu.On the face ofit, Western clouds shouldbe able to stayahead. Theyare still farbig-gerand have a technological edge, for in-stance in specialised chipsto crunch reamsofdata forartiﬁcial-intelligence services.The reluctance to use Chinese technologyisgrowing, and notjustin America.

Butthe chunkyvaluationsofAmerica’sgiantTVbroadcastersimplythattheirad revenueswill fall very slowly, ornotatall. Startupsthatrelyon advertising, such Snap, are ﬂoatingtheirsharesatpricesthatsuggesthuge growth. Large deals, too,are beingjustiﬁed bypotential ad revenues.

The main reason AT&Tsaysitwantsto buyTime Warnerfor$109bn isto create a digital ad plat-form linkingAT&T’sdata to Time Warner’sTVcontent.The immense sumsbeingbeton advertisingraise a question:howmuch ofitcan America take? Aback-of-the-envelope calcu-lation bySchumpetersuggeststhatstockpricescurrently implythatAmerican advertisingrevenueswill rise from 1% ofGDPto-day, to asmuch as1.8% ofGDPby2027—a massive jump. Since1980 the average hasbeen 1.3%, accordingto Jonathan Barnard ofZenith, a media agency, and in the pastfewyearsthe advertisingmarketrelative to GDP hasbeen shrinking.There are reasonswhyitmightgo on a tear, pointsout RobNorman ofGroupM, anothermedia agency. In the old days ad-vertsin Timemagazine oron billboardsin TimesSquare were big-ticketitemsthatonlygiantﬁrmscould aﬀord. Buttech platformshave done a brilliantjob ofpersuadingsmallercompanies tospend moneytargetingcustomers. Facebookhas6m advertisers,equivalentto a ﬁfth ofall American small ﬁrms. Advertscould become even more eﬀective atidentifying cus-tomersand enticingthem to spend money, usingtrovesof datathathave been gathered to anticipate theirneeds. Ascommerceshiftsonline, ﬁrmswill cutbackon conventional marketing (forexample, the feesthatconsumergoodsand food ﬁrmspay to Wal-martto ensure productsare displayed prominentlyon itsshelves), freeingup budgetsto spend more on digital ads.Yetthere are two logical limitsto the size ofthe advertisingmarket. First, the irritation factor, orhowmuch consumers canabsorb withoutbeingputoﬀ. In the analogue era the rule ofthumb wasthatadscould comprise no more than 33-50% ofTVorradio programming, orofa magazine’spages, saysRishad Tobac-cowala, ofPublicis, an advertisingﬁrm. The digital world isal-readyshowingsignsofsaturation. More people are usingad-blockingsoftware. Tech brands thateschewbombardingcustomerswith ads, such asApple and Net-ﬂix, are wildlypopular. The drive to liftuser“engagement” on so-cial-media platformsbyshowingsensational content, in turnboostingthe numberofadsthatcan be sold, hasprompted abacklash. On January11th Facebooksaid itwould showusersfewerpostsfrom “businesses, brandsand media”. Time spenton-line bythe typical American isgrowingatabout10% a year, lessthan the 15-20% ad-salesgrowth thatmanydigital ﬁrmsexpect.The second limiton the size ofthe advertisingmarket ishowmuch cash all otherﬁrms, in aggregate, have attheirdisposal tospend on ads. In theorytheycould spend more and more untiltheiroverall returnson capital drop belowthe costof capital,compromisingtheirﬁnancial viability. Remarkably, expectationsforad revenuesare nowso bullish thattheyimplythat thisboundarywill indeed be tested.Commercial breaking-pointImagine ifadvertisingspendingreallydid rise to 1.8% ofGDPinAmerica by2027. Mostﬁrms’ costswould have to rise, cutting to-tal corporate proﬁts(excludingthose ofad platforms) from about6.5% to 5.7% ofGDP, the kind ofdrop normallyassociated with arecession. Alternatively, imagine ifthe ﬁrmsin the S&P500 index(excludingad platforms) bore all the additional costof the adver-tisingboom. Theircombined return on capital would drop fromthe present10% to 8%, atorjustbelowtheircostofcapital. Ameri-ca Incwould go from beingthe world’sgreatestproﬁtmachine toﬂirtingwith Japanese-style ﬁnancial-zombie status.Thatdoesnotseem realistic. More probably, hopesfor a newage ofadvertisingnirvana are too optimistic.

Two yearslater, when the oilprice slumped below$28, the talkwasof aglobal oil glutcaused bythe furious eﬀortsofthe OPECcartel to regain marketshare.Nowthatoil priceshave tested $70, an-alystsare again scratchingtheirheads.In “1984”, George Orwell coined theterm “doublethink”, the abilityto believetwo contradictorythings. Oil analysisseemsto require similarcognitive gymnas-tics. Three bigquestionsarise. First, whyhasthe oil price more than doubled in thespace oftwo years, againstall expectation?Second, whyhasthissurge been metwithcheersfrom global stockmarketsand notconcern forthe world economy? Lastly,where mightthe oil price eventuallysettle? Startwith the journeyto $70.

Since the oil shocksof the1970s, marketshave associated a suddenrun-up in oil priceswith economiccalami-ty. The world isboth producerand con-sumerofoil, so in principle the overall ef-fectofoil-price increasesisneutral. Butinpractice, the netimpacthad been to reduceglobal demand, because oil exportersinthe Middle Easttended to save a bigchunkofthe windfall income theygained at the the growth ofthe shale-oil industryinNorth America.

On January12th asurprisingarticle in the Wall StreetJournalalleged thatone ofthe bank’ssignature re-ports—on the ease ofdoingbusinessaround the world—mayhave been taintedbythe political motivationsofbankstaﬀ.The storywasbased on an interviewwithMrRomer, who pointed outthatChile’srankingin the yearlyreporthad droppedsharplyduringthe presidencyofMichelleBachelet, a left-leaningpolitician who tookoﬃce forthe second time in 2014. Chilesankso heavilynotbecause doingbusi-nesshad become harder, butbecause thebankhad repeatedlychanged itsmethodofassessment. Thatmethod mostlyentailsansweringmeasurable questions, such ashowmanydaysdoesittake to starta business, registerapropertyorﬁle taxes. The answers deter-mine a country’sscore (known asits“dis-tance to the frontier”), and itsscore, relativeto those ofothercountries, determines itsglobal rankand braggingrights. From 2014 to 2016, the bankmade 12 bigmethodological changes, broadeningsome indicatorsand addingothers. “DoingBusiness2017” (published in late 2016) was,forexample, the ﬁrstin the seriesto askhoweasilycompaniescan obtain a refundorresolve an erroraftertheyhave ﬁledtheirtaxes. In thatreport, Chile was rankedasthe 120th easiestplace to paytaxes, some87 notchesbelowitsrankin the previousyear. No othercountryfell so dramatically. The data-gatheringand analysiswereoverseen bya formerprofessorofeconom-icsatthe UniversityofChile in Santiago,addingto the suspicion ofskulduggery.SupportersofMsBachelet, whose co-alition lostthe recentpresidential election,were apoplectic.

Since ourlastlookatthe indexin July,cheap currencieshave narrowed thevaluation gap againstthe dollar—almostcompletelyin case ofthe Canadian dol-lar(see chart).

Mass-transit rail-waysand highwaysallowed bigcitiesto getbigger. But theircon-gestion-easingbeneﬁtsinevitablyproved temporary. When theNewYorksubwayextended into northern Manhattan, itbecamepractical to live farfrom the dirty, expensive, crowded downtownarea, while still enjoyingaccessto the city’ssocial and economicbeneﬁts. So the city’spopulation rose—a lot—leavingNewYork-ersonce more cheekbyjowl. Apost-warhighway-building boomin America yielded explosive growth in citysuburbs. Cities onceagain found theirequilibrium, however, asthe suburban land-rush led to road congestion, raisingthe costofliving farfrom em-ploymentcentres. In a paperpublished in 2011, GillesDuranton,ofthe UniversityofPennsylvania, and MatthewTurner, ofBrown University, identiﬁed a “fundamental lawofroad conges-tion”: namely, thatbuildingmore highwaysdoesnotalleviatecongestion. Rather, itattractsmore residents, leadsto more driv-ingbyexistingresidentsand booststransport-intensive eco-nomicactivity, until roadsare once again crammed.Driverlesscarsshould cuttraﬃc, otherthingsbeing equal.Loweraccidentrateswill mean fewercrash-related hold-ups,while AIsthatcan pilotcarsmore closelytogetherwill boostroadcapacity. Butreductionsin traﬃcwill make livingin currentlycongested areasmore attractive and hence more populous.

Some driv-ersbalkatpayingforwhattheyonce gotfornothing, and othersare uneasyaboutthe trackingofprivate vehiclesthateﬃcientpricingrequires.

Ifa driverlessworld is one inwhich people generallybuyridesratherthan cars, then notonlymightfewerunnecessaryjourneysbe made, butalso political re-sistance to road-pricingcould ease, and congestion with it.Ok, commuterThatmightlead to a diﬀerentkind ofdystopia (also with histori-cal antecedents): one in which fast, functional transport isavail-able onlyto those who can pay. Luckily, historyalso suggests asolution: masstransit. Ride-hailingservicesmightintroducemulti-passengervehiclesand splittravel costsacrossriders (theycould call them “buses”). Or, asDaniel Rauch and David Schlei-cherofYale Universityargue, governmentsmightinstead co-optthe newtransportecosystem fortheirown purposes.

Theysuggestitismore likelya consequence ofthe tendencyoflanguagesto containwordsuseful to theirspeakers. Sincesmellsmatterlittle to mostpeople, mostlanguageshave fewabstractwordsforthem. Astudyjustpublished in CurrentBi-ology, byAsifa Majid atRadboud Universi-tyin the Netherlandsand Nicole Kruspe atLund Universityin Sweden, supportsthis. DrMajid knewfrom previousworkshehad done thatthe Jahai, a group ofhunter-gathererswho live in western Malaysia,are remarkablygood atnamingodours.Forexample, when she asked some Jahai,and also a comparable group ofAmericanvolunteers, to name coloursand odourstheywere presented with, the Americansgenerallyagreed with one anotherwhen itcame to namingcoloursbutagreed muchlesswhen puttingnamesto odours. Whenpresented with cinnamon, forexample,theydescribed itvariouslyassweet, spicy,wine, candy, edible and potpourri. Whenpresented with babypowdertheyoﬀeredvanilla, wax, babyoil, toiletpaper, dentistoﬃce, hand lotion, rose and bubble gum asdescriptions. Jahai answers, in contrast,were in equal agreementaboutbothodoursand colours.When she published thisresult, Dr Ma-jid suggested thatitmight, in part, be be-cause the Jahai have a dozen wordsdedi-cated to describingdiﬀerentsortsof smellsin the abstract(the equivalentofcolour-wordssuch asred, blue, blackand white,ofwhich there are generallyreckoned to be11in English). Forexample, the Jahai use theword “cxås”forstingingsortsofsmells as-sociated with petrol, smoke and variousinsects, and “plxex”forbloody, ﬁshyandmeatysortsofsmells. Accordingto Dr Ma-jid, only“musty” isable to actin this wayin English withoutdrawingon analogy(banana-like, gooseberry-noted, and evenearthyand sweet-smelling, are all analo-giesofsome sort).To testhowimportantsomeone’swayoflife isto hisorheruse ofabstract wordsforsmells, DrMajid and DrKruspe lookedathowtwo othergroupsofpeople fromthe MalayPeninsula used termsforcol-oursand odours. These were the SemaqBeri, who also huntand gatherfora living,and the Semelai, who cultivate rice. Cru-cially, although these two peoplesmaketheirlivingsin diﬀerentways, their lan-guagesare closelyrelated and theybothlive in the rainforest. DrMajid and DrKruspe asked 20 Se-maq Beri and 21Semelai to name odoursand colourspresented to them atrandom.The colourswere on 80 diﬀerentlyhuedcards; the odourson 16 variouslyscentedsticks. The stickswere daubed with smellslike (to English-speakingsensibilities)leather, orange, ﬁsh, garlicand turpentine. The two researchersfound thatthe Se-maq Beri used abstracttermsforodours86% ofthe time—aboutasoften asthey didforcolours, which was80%. The Semelaialso used abstractcolourdescriptions atasimilarrate, namely78% ofthe time. Butwhen itcame to describingodoursthey re-lied on abstraction on only44% ofocca-sions, while resortingto analogies, such as“banana” and “chocolate”, 56% ofthe time.Moreover, aswith DrMajid’searlierstudywith the Jahai, the Semaq Beri more fre-quentlyagreed with one anotheraboutnamingodoursthan did the Semelai.Given these ﬁndings, DrMajid and DrKruspe argue thatitisthe hunting-and-gatheringwayoflife, ratherthan the use ofaparticularlanguage, thatiscrucial to theuse ofabstractnamesforodours.

Theirproponentsargue thatthe rigorouslogicofan algo-rithm, trained with a vastamountofdata, can make judgmentsaboutwheth-era convictwill reoﬀend thatare un-clouded byhuman bias. Two researchershave nowputone such program, COM-PAS, to the test. Accordingto their study,published in Science Advances, COMPASdid neitherbetternorworse than peoplewith no special expertise. Julia Dressel and HanyFarid ofDart-mouth College in NewHampshire select-ed 1,000 defendantsatrandom from adatabase of7,214 people arrested in Bro-ward County, Florida between 2013 and2014, who had been subjectto COMPASanalysis. Theysplittheirsample into 20groupsof50. Foreach defendanttheycreated a shortdescription thatincludedsex, age and priorconvictions, aswell asthe criminal charge faced. Theythen turned to Amazon Mechan-ical Turk, a website which recruits volun-teersto carryoutsmall tasksin exchangeforcash. Theyasked 400 such volunteersto predict, on the basisofthe descrip-tions, whethera particulardefendantwould be arrested foranothercrimewithin two yearsofhisarraignment(excludinganyjail time he mighthaveserved)—a factnowknown because ofthe passage oftime. Each volunteer sawonlyone group of50 people, and eachgroup wasseen by20 volunteers. WhenMsDressel and DrFarid crunched thenumbers, theyfound thatthe volunteerscorrectlypredicted whethersomeonehad been rearrested 62.1% ofthe time.When the judgmentsofthe 20 whoexamined a particulardefendant’scasewere pooled, thisrose to 67%. COMPAShad scored 65.2%—essentiallythe same asthe human volunteers.To see whethermention ofa person’srace (a thornyissue in the Americancriminal-justice system) would aﬀectsuch judgments, MsDressel and DrFaridrecruited 400 more volunteersand re-peated theirexperiment, thistime addingeach defendant’srace to the description.Itmade no diﬀerence. Participants identi-ﬁed those rearrested with 66.5% accuracy.All thissuggeststhatCOMPAS, thoughnotperfect, isindeed asgood ashumancommon sense atparsingpertinentfactsto predictwho will and will notcome tothe law’sattention again. Thatisencour-aging. Whetheritisgood value, though, isadiﬀerentquestion, forMsDressel andDrFarid have devised an algorithm oftheirown thatwasasaccurate asCOM-PASin predictingrearrestwhen fed theBroward Countydata, butwhich in-volvesonlytwo inputs—the defendant’sage and numberofpriorconvictions. AsTim Brennan, chiefscientistatEquivant, which makesCOMPAS, pointsout, the researchers’ algorithm, havingbeen trained and tested on data from oneand the same place, mightprove lessaccurate iffaced with recordsfrom else-where. Butso longasthe algorithm be-hind COMPASitselfremainsproprietary,adetailed comparison ofthe virtues ofthe two isnotpossible.Are programs betterthan people atpredicting recidivism?THE exhaustingchore ofraisingyoung isone a fewbirdsmanage to avoid. Bylayingtheireggsin the nestsofothers, theydupe those othersinto feedingtheirnest-lings. Such brood parasitism hasarisen in-dependentlyatleastthree times, in thegroupsknown ascuckoos, cowbirdsandhoneyguides. Thatgivesbiologistsa toolwith which to explore the phenomenon ofconvergentevolution, in which unrelatedlineswith similarwaysoflife evolve simi-laradaptationsthathelp them to thrive.One feature shared bycuckoos, cow-birdsand honeyguidesisthatthe shells oftheireggsare all thickerthan those ofthebirdstheyparasitise—sometimesbyasmuch as30%. Thislookslike a classiccaseofconvergentevolution, butno one hasbeen able to prove the pointbydemon-stratinga beneﬁtderived from itthat iscon-nected directlywith brood parasitism. Li-angWei, ofHainan Normal University, inChina, thinkshe hasnowdone so. Hiswork, justpublished in the Science ofNa-ture, suggeststhatthe greaterthickness ofbrood-parasites’ eggshellsprovidesinsula-tion, which speedsup the eggs’ incubation.Thisensurestheyhatch before theirhosts’eggsdo, thusgrantingthe parasitichatch-lingstime to dispose oftheirincipient ri-valsbypuncturingthe eggscontainingthem orpushingthose eggsoutofthe nest.To testthisidea, DrLiangand his col-leaguesdecamped from theirhome in Chi-na’ssouthernmostprovince to Heilong-jiang, itsnorthernmost. TheirdestinationwasZhalongNational Nature Reserve,where reed warblersare parasitised bycommon cuckoos.

When theyfound one thatalsohad a cuckoo egg, theyremoved thategg,togetherwith a warbleregg, and broughtthe pairto theirlaboratory, where theyplaced them in an incubatorat37.5°C—theirnatural incubation temperature. On the ﬁrstdayofthisprocess, and onthree furtheroccasions, spaced three daysapart, each ofthe 15 pairsofeggsthe teamhad collected wastaken outofthe incuba-torfor20 minutes—the average amountoftime clutchesare leftunattended bywar-blermothers(the fathershavinglong de-parted) when theygo foraging. Assoon asthe eggscame outofthe incubator, theteam tookthermal imagesofthem, permit-tingtheirtemperaturesto be estimated.Then, justbefore theyputthe eggsback,theytooka second setofimages. The ﬁndingswere clear. Duringthe 20-minute periodsoutside the incubatorthe 15warblereggslost4.42°Con average, where-asthe 15 cuckoo eggslostan average of4.15°C. Thismaynotseem a huge diﬀer-ence, butexperience ofincubatingbird’seggsartiﬁciallyshowsthatactually itis.Given these ﬁndings, DrLiangarguesthatthe thickereggshellsdo indeed givethe embryoswithin the developmentaledge theyneed to hatch ﬁrst. Asto whywarblersand othervictimsofbrood para-sitism fail to retaliate bythemselves evolv-ingthickereggshells, and thusfaster-hatch-ingyoung, thatisunclear. Presumably theextra costofdoingso isnotworthwhile in aworld where a minorityofnestsare paras-itised. Provingthis, though, would requireawhole newresearch project.7EvolutionShell gameAn intriguing example ofconvergentevolution is explainedThe EconomistJanuary20th2018 Scienceandtechnology69SMALLmulticopterdrones—souped-upversionsofthose sold bythe million asChristmastoys—have tremendouspoten-tial foruse in industryand agriculture.Ratherthan erectingscaﬀoldingorbring-ingin a mechanical platform to inspectthingslike roofsand chimneys, the job canbe done instantly, and probablyforlessmoney, bysendingup a drone-mountedcamera.

In the late 2000s, neo-conserva-tive authorsbegan arguingthatAmericacould have triumphed in Vietnam (and, byextension, could win in Afghanistan andIraq) bycommittingto so-called “counter-insurgency” strategies, which involve po-litical nation-buildingratherthan relyingsolelyon ﬁrepower. Practitionersof coun-ter-insurgency(includingH.R.

Hisnewbookisa biography ofEdward Lansdale, a legendary CIA oﬃcerand paired militaryoﬀensiveswith politi-cal campaignsto divide the communistsand buckup trustin the government.In 1954, Lansdale shifted hisattention toVietnam, where France waslosingitswaragainstHo Chi Minh’sVietMinh guerril-las. Asa CIA liaison oﬃcerin Saigon, hedeveloped a close relationship with NgoDinh Diem (pictured), the nationalist Cath-olicchosen to lead South Vietnam once theFrench leftand the communiststookoverthe north. Lansdale and hisdozen-odd ad-visersplayed a crucial role in stabilisingthe ricketynewstate. Theyarranged forAmerican shipsto evacuate hundredsofthousandsofCatholicsfrom the north tothe south, and helped Diem win the sup-portofsectarian militiasand crush a heavi-lyarmed maﬁa, the Binh Xuyen. BynowLansdale wasseen bythe American publicasa wizard ofdemocraticnation-building,lionised in “The UglyAmerican”, a politi-cal novel aboutAmerican diplomacythatcame outin 1958. (Contraryto rumour, hewasnotthe model forGraham Greene’s“QuietAmerican”.)MrBootarguesthatthingssoured inVietnam afterLansdale returned to Ameri-ca in late 1956. He understood thatﬁghtinginsurgencieswasfundamentallya politi-cal task, one ofbuildinga coherentgovern-mentthatcommandspopularassent.

Once a staunch con-servative, hisattitudeson social issues ofrace and genderhave moved in a liberal di-rection. One question hangingoverhisbookiswhetherhisattitude towardsmili-taryintervention hasmellowed, too.Lansdale wasan advertisingexecutivefrom California who joined the OSS (theprecursorofthe CIA) duringthe secondworld war.

By1963 he waspointlesslycrackingdown on Buddhists,whose monkssetthemselveson ﬁre inprotest. Hisown pilotstried to kill him bybombingthe presidential palace. Fewhis-toriansthinkhe could have saved thesouth. AsforLansdale, while he graspedthe centralityofpoliticsin ﬁghting insur-gencies, he wasprone to wackysecret-agentschemes. Acongressional investiga-tion into CIA misconductin 1975, afterhisretirement, uncovered a proposal he oncemade to undermine Fidel Castro byhavingnavyshipsﬁre special shellsto make Cu-bansthinkthatChristhad returned.

He did notconsiderthemworksofartin theirown rightso much aspictorial scaﬀolding. Theyaided the diﬃ-cultprocessofdecidingwhata painting orsculpture would looklike when itwas ﬁn-ished and demonstrated hisveryrealstrugglesto achieve aestheticperfection.Byeliminatingthese drawingshe wantedposterity, when thinkingofthe great Mi-chelangelo, to be confronted with a tower-ingﬁgure ofinsurmountable genius, oneascold and stiﬀasthe marble he workedwith—in short, a man who conjured up thegreatmasterpiecesin Western artwithminimal eﬀort.Thatpeople can see behind thisfaçadeisdue to the timelyintervention ofanotherinﬂuential ﬁgure ofthe Renaissance: Gior-gio Vasari (1511-74), a painter, architect andauthor, who saved manydrawingsfromthe artist’spurge. Safeguardingthe legacyofthose around him, aswell asthatof theirpredecessors, became Vasari’sobsession.In 1550 he published hismagnum opus,“Livesofthe MostExcellentPainters,Sculptors, and Architects”. In ithe recordsthe manyﬂaws, rivalries, vicesand eccen-tricitiesthattogethercreate a family photo-graph ofthe Quattrocento and Cinquecen-to. Vasari pullshissubjectsdown oﬀ theirartisticpedestals, and sketchesin charac-teristicsthatare all too human. Masacciowasabsent-minded. Filippo Lippi had aninsatiable libido despite beinga monk.Paolo Uccello once ﬂed from hisworkwhen served cheese. In “The CollectorofLives”, an insightfuland grippingnewbookaboutVasari, In-grid Rowland and Noah Charneyavoidthe endlessdebate overwhich ofthe biog-rapher’sstoriesare true orfalse. Instead,theyfocuson whathasbeen included inthe biographyasa wayoflearningmoreaboutVasari himself. Thusa suspiciouslymelodramaticstoryofLeonardo da Vinci dyingin thearmsofKingFrancisI ofFrance, bitterly la-mentinghisown lackofdevotion to his art,revealsmore aboutVasari’sattitude toworkthan Leonardo’s. Vasari achievedcontemporaryfame and wealth byhisrig-orousworkethic. Hisabilityto stick todeadlinesoften exhausted him, butit en-sured a steadystream ofimportantcom-missionsfrom the Medici and the papacy.Shruggingoﬀtauntsfrom jealousrivalsabouthisshortstature, Vasari created workacrossthe Italian peninsula thatwas lau-ded bycontemporariesand made him ascelebrated asmanyofthe artistshe wroteabout. Hisunattractive appearance maywell be the reason, the authorsbelieve,thatVasari championed the similarlyplain-lookingGiotto and Brunelleschi, re-mindingthe readerthat“lumpsofearth of-ten conceal veinsofgold.” MsRowland and MrCharneydrawapanoramicviewofthe art-world duringthe Renaissance, placingVasari atthe cen-tre. He wentto greatlengthsto preservepiecesofscrap paper. TheycontainedsketchesbyMichelangelo, and he deemedthem valuable. Thiswasa time when art-istswere traditionallyanonymous, unedu-cated craftsmen of“prettythings”. Byprio-ritisingthe creatorsthemselvesover whattheycreated, championingtheirdeeds andelevatingtheirstatus, Vasari helped laythefoundationsforarthistoryaswell for howartisunderstood today. Thisisan impor-tantbookand longawaited.

In2015 a countyclerkin Kentuckywasjailedforrefusingto certifythe marriage oftwomen. Gayrightsin America proceeded atan extraordinaryrate between LawrencevTexas(2003), in which the SupremeCourtstruckdown sodomylaws, andObergefell vHodges(2015), which madegaymarriage legal acrossthe country.Transgenderrightscame nextintopublicview. “Transparent”, a successfultelevision show, hasputtranspeople atthe heartofa complexuniverse. The caseofCaitlyn Jenner, who had been anOlympicgold medallistasBruce Jenner,helped bringnotjustvisibilitybut greateracceptance. In liberal circles, being open-lytransphobicisbecomingunacceptable,proceedingalongthe same trajectory—butmuch faster—asattitudestowards ho-mophobia orracism.With moresaround sexand genderal-readyon the move, itislittle surprise thatnon-binarypeople are on the frontlinesofa rightsrevolution. The grammar oftheEnglish language ispartofthe battleﬁeld.Gayrightsinvolved a small linguisticshift—people gettingused to saying“Steve’shusband”. Treatingpeople whohave transitioned to anothergender withrespectrequired anotheradjustment:swapping“he” and “she”, and often learn-inga newname and avoidingthe old one. Butnon-binarypeople, who mayidentifyasofno gender, both, ﬂuid orsomethingelse, askfora change at theverygutsofEnglish. Manyaskto be re-ferred to eitherbyan invented pronoun,such as“ey” or“ze”, or, more commonly,as“they”.Thisishard formanyothers, becausepronounsare a “closed” classofwords,accordingto linguists. Adjectives, nounsand verbsare “open”: theycan be coinedatwill. Tell a tinychild thata kind ofbird iscalled a “wug”, and notonlydo theyim-mediatelyacceptthe existence ofthe wug;theyworkitinto theirgrammar, knowingthatthe plural mustbe “wugs”. Adultsmaybe more conservative, rejectingwords theydo notlike, buttheystill acceptnew nounsand verbsall the time. Long-term changesin the meaningofnouns, verbsand adjec-tivesare also routine. Fewwordsmean ex-actlywhattheydid centuriesago: “bux-om” once meant“obedient”, forexample. Butgrammatical intuitionsare moredeeplydisturbed bythe addition ofnewpronouns, which iswhyinvented ones like“ze” have failed to spread widely. Singular“they”, though, isdiﬀerent. “They” isanold English word. And contraryto the com-mon myth, itcan have single antecedents,asin the case of“someone lefttheirum-brella here.” Thisisnota concession tomodern feminism (avoiding“someone lefthisumbrella”). Itgoesbackto the 14th cen-turyin English, and hasappeared in ﬁneliterarysourcescontinuallyeversince. Butthisuse of“they” isunusual: tradi-tionallyitcan referbackonlyto an indeﬁ-nite antecedent. “Astudentmusthave lefttheirumbrella” isuncontroversial. But“Steve musthave lefttheirumbrella” isjarring. So is“mybestfriend musthavelefttheirumbrella”: even ifthe hearerdoesnotknowifthe friend ismale orfe-male, the speakerpresumablydoes. Sothose non-binarypeople askingto becalled “they”, asin “Taylorlefttheirum-brella”, are up againstthe ingrained gram-marofmanylisteners. Butjusthowingrained isthatgram-mar? Lauren Ackerman, a fellowatNew-castle University, conducted a smallstudy. Fortypeople rated the “natural-ness” ofsentenceslike “Someone dressedthemselves” and “Chloe dressed them-selves”. (She also tested “themself”.) Fewwere bothered by“someone dressedthemselves”. Contraryto MsAckerman’sprediction, responseswere all over thescale for“Chloe dressed themselves”.Moreover, MsAckerman found thatofthe subset(nine) ofthe test-takers whoregularlyinteracted with someone trans-gender, acceptabilitywashigheron aver-age—and itincreased with the frequencyofthe interaction with thatperson.The studyisfartoo small to be deﬁni-tive. Asacademicsalwayssay, more re-search isneeded. Butitisclearthat some-thingisafoothere. Itgoeshand-in-handwith a risingbeliefthatthe gender binaryisa social construct. Mostmembers of“Generation Z”, aged 13-20 in a poll takenin 2016, agree with statementslike “gen-derdoesn’tdeﬁne a person asmuch as itused to” (78%), and 56% knowsomeonewho usesa nontraditional pronoun,against43% forthose 28-34. Pronounsmaynotbe such a closed classafterall. UnlockingpronounsJohnsonPersonal pronouns have been hard to alter. Thatis nowchanging fastenterprise, neglectand dilapidation,“bashed and bedraggled bythe times”, thesolitaryheroine summonsotherriversfrom heratlasofmemory. She revisits wa-terwaysnotonlyin GermanybutCanada,Croatia, Hungary, India and Israel. Although rooted in the author’sownlongresidence in London, “River” isa nov-el, nota documentaryexpedition. Epi-sodesofsatire and fantasy, such asa stintbroadcastingfora Kafka-like version oftheBBC World Service, push ittowardseerieGerman gothicﬁction ratherthan the Lon-don-bred “psychogeography” ofIain Sin-clairorPeterAckroyd. Lighton plot, rich inatmosphere, “River” meanderslike itsliq-uid locales. Italso tracesa path into thepast, which leadsbackto the narrator’smuch-travelled father, and the “post-warcondition” ofhisravaged continent.The woman who hasﬂed herown hin-terland forthe ragged fringe ofLondon dis-coversa dreamlike cityofmelancholymagic. Thisspiritual nomad meetsin this“capital ofchameleons” HasidicJewish,Croatian, Kurdish and African neighbours.With these encounters, MsKinskynods tothe wavesofsettlementthathave stitchedascore ofmigrantnarrativesinto east Lon-don’stattered fabric.Yetthe perpetual ﬂuxofLondon, where“Nothingbegan…and nothingended”,cannotlaythe pastto rest. Regretand reliefmingle asshe packsagain foranother newlife in eastern Europe.

In1927, thisentrepreneurial immigrant, whohad arrived in NewYorkfrom TsaristRus-sia aged 16, acquired the onlylocal licenceto sell the FredericsPermanentWavemachine forcurlinghair. Like manybusi-nessmen ofthe times, he expected his el-destson to followhim into the family ﬁrm. ButLouisBernstein, born in August 1918and known to everyone asLenny(he oﬃ-ciallychanged hisname to Leonard as ateenager), had diﬀerentideas. The familyhad no musical rootsto speakof, but ten-year-old Lennyfound himselfdrawn ob-sessivelyto hisauntClara’spiano. No mat-terthathisfatherremained vehementlyopposed to the notion thathe should makemusichislife, there wasbutone pathahead. Forall hisearlymisgivings, Samuel lat-erconceded thathisson wasa genius. Inhispassport, Leonard Bernstein simplycalled himselfa “musician”—characteristichumilityfrom a man whose broadachievementsare unique in musical his-tory. Bernstein wasa conductorwhose in-terpretive giftsoverthe course ofhalf acenturyshone lighton the classicsfromHaydn to Mahler, Bartokto Stravinsky. Hewasa composernotjustofBroadwaymas-terpieceslike “WestSide Story”, butofbal-let, opera and chambermusic; orchestral,instrumental, choral and vocal works; andeven a ﬁlm score (“On the Waterfront”,starringa youngMarlon Brando). He was aﬁne concertpianistand pioneeringbroad-caster; an educator, Harvard lecturer, writ-erand humanitarian; a husband, father,lover—and a bona ﬁde celebritywith thegood looks, charisma and hair(ironically)ofa ﬁlm star. Such a multifaceted life wasnotwithoutcomplexities, contradictionsand critics—butoh, whata life. The Bernstein legend wasforged on No-vember14th 1943. Havingbeen outparty-ingafterthe premiere ofhissongcycle “IHate Music”, the 25-year-old waswoken byaphone call at9am requestingthathe re-place the indisposed maestro Bruno Walt-erin a majorconcertthatafternoon. Itwasto be a live, nationwide radio broadcastwith the NewYorkPhilharmonic(whereBernstein wastwo monthsinto a gigas as-sistantconductor) featuringa fearsomeprogramme includingSchumann, Straussand Wagner. There wasno time forre-hearsal. Bernstein puton “the one goodsuitthatI had” (a double-breasted shark-skin) and wentto Carnegie Hall. “No signsofstrain ornervousness”, remarked a daz-zled NewYorkTimesthe nextday—on itsfrontpage. Whetheritknewitornot,America wasseekinga musical ﬁgure whocould harnessthe European classical tradi-tion with a certain homegrown energy.Theyhad found theirman. Bernstein wascuriousaboutall sorts ofmusic, includingjazz, folk, bluesandklezmer. Hisown daughterJamie—one ofthree children Bernstein had with his wife,Felicia Montealegre, a Chilean actress—tellsofthe joyofdevouringBeatles LPswith him. (He wasmad forthem: “Ilearned more aboutmusicbylistening tothe Beatleswith mydad than I thinkI didanyotherway.”) Bernstein’sown music,whetherdestined forBroadwayorthe con-certhall, ishelplesslyeclectic—aswell asunapologeticallytonal when Schoenberg-inﬂuenced serialism wasall the rage. Hisscoresblithely, ingeniouslyunited dispa-rate musical elementsand forged a path forfuture musical mixologiststhatwouldhave been unthinkable withouthim.Greatclassical artiststrade in elevatedabstractionsand are often given licence bythe publicto stayin ivorytowers, seeming-lyunconcerned aboutthe messyrealitiesoflife asitisactuallylived. There are someshiningexceptions, such asYehudi Menu-hin, MstislavRostropovich and Daniel Ba-renboim. Bernstein, a lifelongprogres-sive—“liberal and proud ofit”, he oncesaid—wasa pioneerin thisway. The charitable and humanitariancauseshe supported were legion. “All hislife,” hisdaughterJamie recalls, he “clunghard to the beliefthatbycreatingbeauty,and bysharingitwith asmanypeople aspossible, artistshad the powerto tip theearthlybalance in favourofbrotherhoodand peace.” Afterthe assassination ofJohnKennedyin 1963, he declared: “Thiswill beourreplyto violence: to make musicmoreintensely, more beautifully, more devoted-lythan everbefore.” Atthe fall ofthe BerlinWall in 1989, “empowered bythe moment”ashe latersaid, Bernstein conducted a con-certofBeethoven’sninth symphonyandwasinspired to change a vital word in theSchillerpoem which formsthe ﬁnal “Odeto Joy” movement, replacingthe wordFreude(“joy”) with Freiheit(“freedom”). Itbecame known indeliblyasthe “BerlinFreedom Concert”; Bernstein wasevertheshowman. Meanwhile, hisown compositionsat-tempted to addressthe world around him.His“SymphonyNo. 2: The Age ofAnxiety”explored the psychicdamage ofthe secondworld war. “Candide” wasexpresslycon-ceived asa protestagainst1950sMcCarthy-ism. “WestSide Story” tackled, with eter-nal relevance, the tragedyofgangwarfareand the evilsofbigotryand prejudice. Bernstein’spolitical side did notgo un-noticed. TheFBI’sdossieron him includedsome 1,000 items. Anothercache ofdocu-ments, released in 2011, provesthatthe con-ﬂictshe exempliﬁed in hiscareer—be-tween classical purism and the Broadwaystage, between the publicgloryofconduct-ingand the private isolation ofcompos-ing—were a mirrorto the internal tensionshe battled asa gayman who genuinelywanted to be a familyman, lovinghus-band and father. In 1951Felicia had toldhim, in a letter: “Youare a homosexual andmayneverchange…I am willingto acceptyouasyouare.” Theyremained happilymarried until herdeath in 1978. Bernstein died, aged 72, in 1990. Therehave since been bold classical composerswho straddle genres; charismaticconduc-torswho have the common touch; vision-aryteacherswho practise joyousinclusiv-ityand access. ButBernstein wasBernstein. Thisyear, more than 2,000eventswill attemptto honourthatsingularlegacy. From the American citieswhere hewassuch a beloved ﬁxture (NewYork, Bos-ton, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washing-ton and Chicago) to Europe eastand west(London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Budapest)to countriesasculturallydiverse as Japan,China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Isra-el, 100 yearssince Bernstein’sbirth, thereis, itseems, a place forhim everywhere.7Leonard Bernstein at 100Aman in

In Brazil and Russia, where theindustries have been plagued by eco-nomic turmoil in recent years, car salesrebounded. New registrations in theEuropean Union swelled by 3.4%. China,the world’s largest car market, saw onlymoderate growth, as a tax cut which hadboosted sales in 2016 began to be phasedout. The picture was gloomier in Americaand Britain. Light-vehicle sales in Ameri-ca recorded their ﬁrst annual drop since2009, as a result of interest-rate rises andagrowing inventory of secondhandvehicles. In Britain, new registrations fellby 5.7% because of weakening consumerconﬁdenceand uncertainty about poten-tial new charges on diesel vehicles.78The EconomistJanuary20th2018ACROSSthe buyingcounteratthe StrandBookStore, which isasworn and bat-tered asan old school desk, hasﬂowedmuch ofthe secondhand-booktrade ofthecityofNewYork. Dog-eared tomesin col-lege bags; shinyreviewcopiesdropped inbycritics; bland boxesofpublishers’ re-mainders, and tantalisingparcelsfromprivate estates; leather-bound volumeswith uncutpages, and paperbacksrescuedbyvagrantsfrom the trash. The whole mo-mentum ofNewYorkpublishingand read-ingseemsto push towardsthatcounterwhere Fred Basspresided, buildingup hisstockfrom 70,000 in 1956 to 2.5m bythe1990s, and so rapidlyexceedinghissalesspace thatmanybooksalso sitin a ware-house atSunsetPark, in Brooklyn. To thisplenitude ofbookshe was forev-eraddingmore. Everydayhe approachedhiscounterlike a small boyon a treasure-hunt. And treasure did turn up: a ﬁrst edi-tion ofJamesJoyce’s“Ulysses” (he paid$7,000; resale price, $38,000), and a secondfolio Shakespeare (sold for$100,000). Yetthe vibrantlife ofthe shop pleased him justasmuch. From hiscounterhe could surveythe crazilyoverstuﬀed main ﬂoor, man theever-ringingphone, and keep an eye onpeople browsingthe dollarcartsoutside(“We prosecute everybody”). Graduallythe businesscovered so manycreakywooden ﬂoors, branchingouteven to sat-ellitesatCentral Parkon Fifth Avenue andthe Flatiron Districtand elsewhere, thatwhathe could see wasbuta tinyportion ofthe whole. Still, he could directthe ﬂow. Hisbusinesswas(and is) such a featureatBroadwayand 12th, with its1950sred fas-cia, itslingeringstreetbrowsersand itspa-rade ofwhite-on-red signs—“Open SevenDaysUntil 10.30pm”, “Sell YourBooksHere”, “ASKUS”—thatitseemed to havebeen there always. Buthe moved ittherefrom Fourth Avenue, from the derelictionofwhathad once been the BookDistrict, in1957, shortlyafterhe tookoverfrom hisfa-therBenjamin. The secondhand sectorwasdying, and hisfatherthoughtheshould tryanothertrade. Butbythen Fredhad been thoroughlyinfected. The book-dusthe had been sweepingup sinceschooldayshad gotinto hisblood, and henevergotitout. Workingwith hisfather, animmigrantfrom Lithuania who had bat-tled destitution bybrowsingand acquir-ing, wassparky. Butthe pursuitofbooksunited them. He would lugthe preciousbundlesbackon the subway, the rope dig-ginginto hishands. He supposed later thattheirbookshop survived, when 50 orsootherswentunder, because hisfather hadtaughthim whathe knew. Atthe buyingcounterhisfathersome-timesyelled. Fred, when he assumed com-mand, wasquieter. With histhree-piecesuitsand neatbeard, he looked more likean IvyLeague professor. The workings ofhismind, though, moved lightning-sharpthrough price-scales, stocknumbersandprevailingtaste. And hisdecision was ﬁnal.AbiographyofHubertHumphrey? No-bodywanted to read abouthas-beens. Acanvasbagofhardbacks? Ata glance, $15.He mostlywentby“feel”, losinghistemperonlywhen he wasoﬀered booksthatweredirty, orhad no covers. “Are youreallytry-ingto sell this?” he would ask. And he triedto be fair, even to the down-and-outs. Afterall, beside the pawnshop, thiswasalmostthe onlyplace in the citywhere youcouldjustwalkin and sell stuﬀ. Towardsstaﬀhe wasalso kind, thoughnotfoolishlyso. Their$10.50 an hour, atlat-estrates, washardlythe NewYorklivingwage, butwith 60 folka weekliningup toworkatthe Strand he could obviouslyname hisprice. In orderto see whattheyknewaboutbooks(since “Withoutgoodpeople, youdon’thave anythinggoing”),he devised a quizto match ten authorswith ten works, from Homeronwards.Hundredsfailed.

Havingbroiled bythen in book-stacksthrough 70NewYorksummers, Fred sawno problem.Modernitykeptencroachingon his em-porium, buthe wassanguine aboutmostofit. Amazon did notseem to denthistrade, especiallysince he had turned theshop into such an icon ofNewYorkthat15% ofthe revenuesnowcome from salesofStrand T-shirts, tote-bags, mugs, socksand scented candles. The store’sstatusinthe cityreached a sortofapogee, for him,on the nighttwo oﬃcersfrom the PoliceDepartmentapproached him ashe wasclosingup and asked him, shyly, whethertheymightbuya T-shirt. Living and deadOne question often asked waswhyonearth he needed more books, when thosehe hadn’tyetsold were heapingup allover. He had asked hisfatherthe samething, butsoon understood. Youcouldn’tsell a bookyoudidn’thave. Besides, thesecondhand-booktrade wasnotaboutold,inert, long-accumulated things. Itwasalive, and needed renewingall the time. Asfastashe wastakingin fresh, lively booksathiscounter, staﬀwould be clearing farshelvesofall the dead, which would neversell. And thisphilosophyseemed to ex-plain a second question thatarose: how inone year, 2005, the store’s“8 MilesofBooks” suddenlybecame “18”. Some Jew-ish patronsofthe Strand pointed out that,in Hebrew, 18 isalso the numerical value ofthe word chai—meaning“life”. 7Browsingatthe StrandFred Bass, who builtNewYork’s Strand BookStore into the largestsecondhandemporium in the world, died on January3rd, aged 89ObituaryFred BassSpeakers include:January 23rd 2018DavosImplementing strategy in a drawbridge-up worldTHE BUSINESSCASE FOROPENNESSbusinesscase.economist.com@EconomistEvents #EconBusinessCaseSupported byJONATHAN AUERBACH Executive vice-president,  chief strategy
