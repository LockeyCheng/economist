Ithassuﬀered civilwars, tribalism, jihadistvio-lence and appallingpoverty. Butnone ofthiscompareswith themiserybeinginﬂicted on thecountrytodaybythe warbe-tween a Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, a Shia militiabacked byIran.The UNreckonsthree-quartersofYemen’s28m peopleneed some kind ofhumanitarian aid. Mountingrubbish, fail-ingsewerage and wrecked watersupplieshave led to theworstcholera outbreakin recenthistory. The country ison thebrinkoffamine. The economyhascrumbled, leavingpeoplewith impossible choices. Each daythe al-Thawra hospital inHodeida mustdecide which ofthe life-savingequipment torun with whatlittle fuel ithas.Perhapsthe worstofitisthatmuch ofthe world seems un-perturbed (see Brieﬁng), calloused bythe yearsofbloodshedin Syria and otherpartsofthe Middle East, and despairing ofitsabilityto eﬀectchange. To be cynical, Yemen is fartherawayfrom Europe than Syria is; itswretched people do not, on thewhole, wash up in the Westseekingasylum.Yetthe world ignoresYemen atitsperil. Setaside fora mo-mentthe obligation to relieve suﬀeringand protectcivilians.Hard securityinterestsare also atstake. The world can ill aﬀordanotherfailed state—a newAfghanistan orSomalia—that be-comesa breeding-ground forglobal terrorism. Yemen, more-over, dominatesthe Bab al-Mandab strait, a choke-point forshipsusingthe Suezcanal. Like itornot, the Westis involved.The Saudi-led coalition isﬁghtingwith Western warplanesand munitions. Western satellitesguide itsbombs.SlipperySalehLike so much else in the Arab world, Yemen’sagonycan betraced to the Arab-springuprisingsof2011. Massprotests, anear-assassination ofthe then president, Ali Abdullah Saleh,and a shove from neighbouringpetro-statesforced him to stepdown in 2012 in favourofhisvice-president, Abd Rabbo Man-sourHadi. Adraftconstitution in 2015 proposed a federal sys-tem and a parliamentsplitbetween northernersand south-erners. Butthe Houthi rebels, who had foughtMrSaleh,rejected it. The Houthis, who followthe Zaydi branch ofShi-ism (asdo perhaps40% ofYemenis), complained that, amongotherthings, the constitution stuckthem in a region with fewresourcesand withoutaccessto the sea. Nowallied with MrSaleh, who spotted an opportunity foracomeback, the Houthisousted MrHadi from Sana’a, the cap-ital, and chased him all the wayto Aden. Saudi Arabia gath-ered a coalition ofArab statesand local militias—among themIslamists, Salaﬁstsand southern separatists—and forced theHouthisto retreatpartway. Forthe pastyear, the battle-lineshave barelymoved. The Houthisare too weakto rule over Ye-men buttoo powerful forSaudi Arabia to defeat.Asa result, Yemenishave become the pawnsin the regionalpower-struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Alarmed byIran’sspreadinginﬂuence, the Saudishave begun to speak ofthe HouthisratherasIsraelisreferto the Lebanese militia, Hiz-bullah: a dangerousIranian proxyarmyon theirborder. In-deed, the Saudishave much to learn from Israel’sexperience.Even with the mostsophisticated weapons, itisall but impos-sible to defeata militia thatiswell entrenched in a civilian pop-ulation. The strongerside isblamed forthe pain ofthose civil-ians. Forthe weakerlot, survival isvictory. So, even though the Houthisare primarilyresponsible forstartingthe warand capable ofgreatcruelty, itisthe Saudiswho are accused ofwarcrimes. Often the accusation is justi-ﬁed. In theiraircampaign, theyhave been carelessand incom-petentatbest, and probablycynical. Human-rightsgroups saybombshave been aimed atschools, markets, mosquesandhospitals. And the blockade raisessuspicion thatthe Saudisare usingfood asa tool ofwar.The longerthe wargoeson, the more Saudi Arabia’sWest-ern alliesare complicitin itsactions. PresidentDonald Trumphasgiven Saudi Arabia carte blanche to actrecklessly (see page39). He maythinkitisall partofconfrontingIran; orhe maywantto supportthe liberalisingreformsofthe Saudi crownprince, Muhammad bin Salman; orhe mayhope to proﬁt bysellingthe Saudis“lotsofbeautiful militaryequipment”.Whateverthe case, he isdamagingAmerica’sinterests. Precise-lybecause ofthe importance ofSaudi Arabia—the world’sbig-gestoil exporterand home to Islam’stwo holiestplaces—theWestshould urge restrainton the impetuousprince and helpdisentangle him from an unwinnable war.How? Peace talksled bythe UNhave begun with the de-mand thatthe Houthissurrender. Thatisunrealistic. Bettertofreeze the conﬂictand ﬁnd anothermediator, such as Oman orKuwait. Adeal should involve a phased withdrawal ofHouthiﬁghtersfrom Sana’a and the Saudi border, and the end of theSaudi blockade. Yemen needsan inclusive government, elec-tionsand a newstructure forthe state. Saudi Arabia will needguaranteesthatIranian armsare notﬂowinginto Yemen. Thenitwill have to cough up the cash to rebuild the country. None ofthiswill be easy. Buta reasonable peace oﬀer ismore likelyto crackthe Houthisthan more bombing. Withoutthe coverofﬁghtingSaudi aggression, the Houthiswill have toanswerfortheirfailures. The publicisincreasingly turningagainstthem, the alliance with MrSaleh isfrayingand theHouthisthemselvesare divided. Stop the warRightnow, farfrom haltingthe spread ofIran’sinﬂuence, thewarhasdeepened the Houthis’ reliance on Iran, which has aneasyand cheap meansoftormentingthe Saudis. And becauseSaudi Arabia isbogged down in Yemen, Iran hasa freer handto setthe termsofa settlementin Syria. The waris a drain onthe Saudisata time ofausterityand wrenchingeconomic re-formsathome. Theyshould therefore learn anotherlessonfrom Israel’sexperience ofﬁghtingHizbullah. Ifwars are to befoughtatall, theyshould be short, and have limited aims. De-terrence isbetterthan debilitatingentanglement. 7The warthe world ignoresApointless conﬂicthas caused the world’s worsthumanitarian crisisLeaders12LeadersThe EconomistDecember2nd20171NORTHERNIRELAND bare-lyfeatured in lastyear’sBrexitreferendum campaign, inwhich Britonswere more inter-ested in mattersofmigrationand money. Yetthe future of the500km borderthatseparatestheNorth from the Irish Republic—and which will soon separate the United Kingdom from theEuropean Union—hasbecome one ofthe trickiestissues oftheexittalks.The windingborderhasrevealed a tangle in the “red lines”laid down byTheresa May. Afterleavingthe EU, Britain wantsto do itsown trade dealswith the restofthe world, whichmeansleavingthe EU’scustomsunion. And, like Ireland, itwantsto maintain the open, invisible borderthatwas en-hanced bythe Good FridayAgreementof1998, endingthreedecadesofviolence. Thispresentsa problem: havinga diﬀer-entcustomsregime to the EUmeansimposingcustomscon-trols, which in turn impliesthatthe bordercannotbe quite soseamlessastoday. Ireland, backed bythe EU, hasthreatened toblockanyoutcome involvinga harderborder, raisingthe riskthatBritain could end up with no deal atall (see page 48).The bestwayoutofthe messwould be to redrawthe redline on customs. Itwould be in Britain’sintereststo stayin acustomsunion with the EUregardlessofthe Irish question.Britain doeshalfitstrade in goodswith Europe. Customs con-trolswould cause delaysand mountainsofbureaucracy. For-goingthe abilityto sign trade dealswith othercountries wouldhurt. Buttheirpromise isoverestimated. Adeal with, say,America would mean imposingAmerican standards—thinkchlorine-washed chicken—on a publicthathasjustvoted to“take backcontrol”. In a customsunion with Europe, Britainwould continue to enjoytrade dealswith the 60-odd countrieswith which the EU alreadyhasarrangements.Brexiteerswill hearnone ofthis. Butabandoningthe otherred line, the commitmentto an invisible border, would beworse. To do so would make both sidespoorer. More seriously,itwould breakthe termsofthe Good FridayAgreement, whichhasended a conﬂictin which 3,600 people were killed and setthe island ofIreland on a longjourneytowardspeace.Ratherthan choose between itsred lines, Britain seems pre-pared to blurthem. Ithasreportedlysuggested thatNorthernIreland could be given newpowersallowingitto follow thesame regulatoryregime asthe EUin areassuch asagricultureand energy, where there ismostcross-bordertrade. The hope isthatthiswould allowthe Irish borderto remain pretty invisi-ble, even asBritain pursued a customsregime ofitsown.Give and takeSuch a plan would require all sidesto compromise. Even withharmonised ruleson agriculture, the borderwould probablyhave to be harderthan Ireland would like. OtherEUcountrieswould have to putup with a frontierthrough which it wouldbe relativelyeasyto smuggle untaxed goods. In a part oftheworld thathasa historyoforganised crime, thatisno smallrisk. Perhapsthe biggestcompromise would be needed fromNorthern Irish unionists, who resistanyattemptto divide theprovince from the British mainland. Northern Ireland maysoon be closerin regulatorytermsto the Irish Republic than toBritain. Itdoesnottake much imagination to see where thatprecedentcould eventuallylead.The fudge maybe justenough to getBritain through to thenextround ofBrexittalks. Butkeepingall partieshappy withthe detailsofthe ﬁnal deal will notbe easy. The episode showshowBrexitwill require Britain to make painful choices—andimpose them on itsclosestallies. In the yearahead there willbe plentymore ofthat. 7Brexit and the Irish questionBorderline solutionThe fate ofthe Irish frontiershows the compromises thatBrexitwill force Britain to makeITOUGHTto be a love-in.American companiessupporttaxcutsand deregulation.

InChina, however, the migrantsmostfrequentlygrumbledabout, and treated with thegreatesthostility, are not foreign-ersbutotherChinese: rural folkwho move to the citiesin search ofa betterlife. This hasbeenon showin the pastfewdaysin the capital, Beijing. On Novem-ber18th a blaze in a ramshackle warehouse-cum-apartment-blockkilled 19 people believed to be migrantsfrom elsewherein China. The authoritiesare nowusing“ﬁre safety” asa pre-textto drive thousandsofothermigrantsoutofthe basements,air-raid sheltersand shantieswhere theylive (see page 28)—often bycuttingoﬀtheirelectricityand water. Ithas amountedto a massexpulsion from the capital. Itisclearthatoﬃcialsare notsimplyaimingto preventfu-ture ﬁres. Afewvolunteerswho have tried to setup sheltersforpeople who have found themselvessuddenlyhomelessinsub-zero temperatureshave been ordered bypolice to closethem. The capital hasa longrecord oftryingto limit the popu-lation ofmigrantsfrom the countryside bymakingitharder forthem to rentcrummyaccommodation, the onlykind that mostofthem can aﬀord. Theycannotbuya home withoutbeingformallyemployed (which mostare not) and havingresidencypapers(which are almostimpossible forthem to obtain). The governmentwantsto restrictthe growth ofmegacitiessuch asBeijing. Itsaystheirlarge populationsputtoo muchstrain on watersupplies, roads, hospitalsand so on. Eﬀortstoease such pressureson the capital have been dramatic. Theyhave included spendingtensofbillionsofdollarson pipingand channellingmore waterinto the cityfrom hundreds ofmilesaway—a projecttouted asthe biggestofitskind in theworld. Even more dramatically, in April the government an-nounced plansto build a whole newcityfrom scratch, about100km (60 miles) from Beijing, where some businessesanduniversitieswill be relocated. Thatwill costanother fewhun-dred billion dollars. Beijingaimsto have no more than 23m res-identsby2020, compared with nearly22m today—an implau-sible goal, withoutyetmore abuse ofmigrants.

Hence the thuggish treatmentofshanty-dwellers andthe routine shakedownsbypolice ofanyshabbilydressed per-son headingtowardsTiananmen Square. Who knowswhatchaosmightbe unleashed bya protestthere aboutunpaidwages, abusive bossesorothermigrantgrievances? There are waysofeasingthe capital’sgrowth painsthatwould be both more humane and more eﬃcient. Waterisscarce largelybecause itistoo cheap.

Butitwould belessdisruptive than buildingan entire newcitydown the road. Above all, Beijingand othermegacitiesshould stop treatingsettlersfrom elsewhere in the countryassecond-class citizens.Refreshingly, some publicintellectualsin Beijingsigned a peti-tion deploringthe recentevictionsasa violation of humanrights. Butall too often residentsofthe capital ignore the mis-treatmentofmigrants. Manyshare the government’sworriesaboutovercrowded schoolsand hospitals. Butifthe migrantswere allowed to have properjobs, theywould paymore taxesand supportmore publicservices. Discriminatingagainstthem can be deadly. When theyare, in eﬀect, barred from for-mal, regulated housing, theyend up in ﬁretraps.Itwould be betterto give all Chinese citizensthe samerightsto live where theyplease and obtain publicserviceswhere theylive. Ideallythatwould mean abolishingthe hukousystem, which tiesChinese to the place theirfamilycamefrom. Failingthat, the governmentshould atleaststop puttingarbitrarycapson the populationsofmegacities. Such capsmake no economicsense. The more people a cityattracts, themore productive itbecomes, aspeople forge millionsof valu-able connectionswith each other. Also, Beijing’sand Shang-hai’snon-migrantpopulationsare setto age and shrink asa re-sultofdecliningbirth rates. Theywill soon need migrants evenmore urgentlythan theydo today. Outofself-interest, ifnoth-ingelse, theyshould treatthem decently. 7THE permanentrevolutionrumbleson.

Anewaccountingrule, IFRS9, also kicksin, demandingtimelier pro-visionsforcreditlosses. The global capital standards drawn upafterthe crisis, Basel 3, mayatlastbe on the verge ofcomple-tion—implyingyetanotheruptickin equityrequirements forsome European lenders.Amid thisblizzard oflettersand digits, the European Com-mission ispushingahead on yetanotherfront.

Asinglesupervisor, housed in the European Central Bank(ECB),watchesoverthe euro zone’sbiggestlenders.

The zone’seconomicbouncebackmightwell make itscompletion seem lessurgent(see Free exchange).

The warcontinues, though the frontline hashardlybudged in the pastyear. Fightingisnotunusual in Yemen.

In the pastcenturyithasseenabouta dozen conﬂicts, involvingoverhalfa dozen countries.Some seedsoftoday’sﬁghtingweresown in battlesin the 1960s—a civil warinthe north and an insurgencyagainstBritishcolonial forcesin the south. Two distinctYemeni statesarose. Leadersin the northturned to religiousauthorityfortheir legiti-macy, enlistingthe supportofIslamic cler-ics. The more secularsouth adopted Marx-ism and aligned itselfwith the SovietUnion. Political feudingled to further warsin 1972 and 1979, buteconomichardshipand the end ofthe cold warbroughtthesidestogether. Aftera seriesoffailed agree-mentsin the 1970sand 1980s, north andsouth atlastagreed on a newconstitutionin 1990, in the hope thata showofunitywould attractforeign investmentand in-crease the extraction ofYemen’soil.Moneybrieﬂyﬂowed in and oil out. Butsimmeringill-feelingerupted into civil warin 1994 in which MrSaleh’snorthern forceswere victorious. In the aftermath his Gen-eral People’sCongress(GPC) dominatedparliament, then setaboutconsolidatingpower. Parliamentaryelectionsin 2003were postponed and criticsdetained. MrSaleh and hishenchmen are thoughttohave stolen billionsofdollarsofstatefunds, while mostYemenisgotbyon lessthan $3 a day. Resentmentofhisrule grew.The Zaydis, a Shia sect, who make upperhaps40% ofthe population, feltpartic-ularlymarginalised byMrSaleh (thoughhe isone ofthem). The Houthisemergedfrom thisgroup in the 1990s, bristlingat thegrowth ofthe Saudis’ conservative reli-giousinﬂuence and Yemen’salliance withAmerica in itswaron terror. MrSaleh, inturn, accused the group ofwantingto over-throwhisgovernment. Hundredsofpeo-ple died in ﬁghtingbetween the Houthisand pro-governmentforcesbetween 2004and 2010—includingHussein Badruddinal-Houthi, the group’sleader, from whomittakesitsname.Opposition to MrSaleh’srule came to ahead duringthe Arab springof2011, whentensofthousandsofYemenistookto thestreets. With a push from the Gulfstates, hestepped down in 2012 and wassucceededbyMrHadi, hisvice-president. Thusbeganashort-lived period ofhope. Talksover-seen bythe UN led to a plan in 2014 foranewconstitution enshrininga federal sys-tem and a parliamentsplitbetween north-ernersand southerners.The Houthis, however, continued todistrustthe government. Theyboycottedan election won byMrHadi in 2012 and op-posed the agreementof2014, on thegroundsthatitstuckmostofthem in a re-gion with fewresourcesand no access tothe sea. Norhad theyreceived positions inthe governmentthattheywanted. Theirfrustration wasshared byMrSaleh, whosoughtto undermine the transition in thehope ofregainingthe presidencyor, atleast, handingitto hisson. ResentmenttowardsMrHadi and dis-quietoverthe growingpowerofIslah, anIslamistpartyaﬃliated to the MuslimBrotherhood, Egypt’smain Islamistgroup,broughtthe Houthisand MrSaleh into anunlikelyalliance in 2014. In Septemberofthatyeartheirforcesentered Sana’a—andwere welcomed bymanyYemeniswhohad become disenchanted with MrHadi’sineﬀective leadership. Apower-sharingdeal between the Houthisand the govern-mentwasbrokered bythe UN—and thenignored. In early2015 the rebelsseized fullcontrol ofthe capital.

However, theyhave notbeen able to drive them outof ter-ritoryseized in the north, including Sana’a.So instead the coalition seemsintent onstarvingthe north.The Saudishave created much ofthemiserythatblightsYemen, butblame fallson others, too. The Houthisand MrSaleh’sforceshave also carried outindiscriminateattacksin citiessuch asTaizand Aden.Theyhave held up aid and are accused ofwarproﬁteering. MrHadi saysthe Houthislooted around $4bn from the central bankto payforthe war(the Houthissaythemoneywasused forfood and medicine).So he moved the bankfrom Sana’a to Adenin 2016 and stopped payingthe salaries ofpublicservantsin the north. Schools andhospitalshave closed and manynorthern-ersface destitution.ForSaudi Arabia, the region’sSunnichampion, the failure ofitscampaign in Ye-men istwofold. Notonlywasitdesigned toreinstate MrHadi’sgovernment—itwasalso supposed to send a signal to Iran’sShia regime.

Itwasthe third testofan intercontinen-tal ballisticmissile (ICBM) since July, andthe 20th missile testthisyear. Afterwatch-ingthe launch, the country’sleader, KimJongUn, who had spentthe previousdayvisitinga catﬁsh farm, announced: “Wehave ﬁnallyrealised the greathistoriccause ofcompletingthe state nuclear force,the cause ofbuildinga rocketpower.” MrKim eschewed the extravagantlybellicose rhetoriche normallyindulges inaftera successful missile launch. His “sol-emn declaration” emphasised thatNorthKorea would be a “responsible nuclearpower” that“would notpose anythreat toanycountryand region” aslongasthe in-terestsofNorth Korea “are notinfringedupon”. Itsounded like a plea forNorth Ko-rea to be respected asa nuclearstate, notviliﬁed asa pariah. Like the two earlierlaunches, the mis-sile wasﬁred on a highlyelevated trajec-tory, reachinga heightof4,475km duringits53-minute ﬂight. On a normal trajectory,expertsreckon, itsrange would be around13,000km—enough to strike almostany-where in the world (see map). The govern-mentnewsagency, KCNA, claimed thatthemissile carried a “super-large heavywar-head”, implyingthatitcould delivera hy-drogen bomb ofthe kind the North deto-nated in an underground teston Sept-ember3rd. There isno wayofknowingwhetherthe claim istrue. Ifthe payload was actual-lylighterthan KCNAsays, the missile’srange could drop to 8,000km when ﬁttedwith a real warhead, accordingto MichaelElleman ofthe International Institute forStrategicStudies. MostanalystsbelievethatNorth Korea hasmanaged to miniatur-ise a crude nucleardevice. Butitmay notyetbe able to make a more destructive H-bomb small enough to ﬁton a missile.There are also still doubtsasto whetherNorth Korea hasmastered the technologyneeded to protecta warhead duringanICBM’sdescent. In the previousICBMtestin July, the re-entryvehicle seemed to burnand disappear. Itwould, however, be rash to assumethatNorth Korea’sengineerswill notsoonbe able to packa miniaturised H-bombinto a robustre-entryvehicle. An indica-tion ofthe speed with which theyarelearningisthatthe latestmissile waslaunched with lesswarningthan previousones, suggestingthatthe lengthyprocessoffuellingitmayhave been carried out be-fore itwastransported to itslaunch pad,thusshorteningthe time ofitsvulnerabili-tyto pre-emptive attack.Nonetheless, within sixminutesof thelaunch South Korean forcesﬁred missilesfrom a ground-based unit, an Aegisde-stroyerand a KF-16 ﬁghter, in an apparentsimulation ofa pre-emptive strike on amissile launch. Amilitaryspokespersonsaid the drill “showsourresolve and abili-tyto strike the origin ofprovocation”. Donald Trump contented himselfwithtellingreporters: “We’ll take care ofit.” RexTillerson, America’ssecretaryofstate, saidthat“diplomaticoptionsremain viableand open, fornow…The United Statesre-mainscommitted to ﬁndinga peacefulpath to denuclearisation and to endingbelligerentactionsbyNorth Korea.” Nobodyreallybelievesthatthere isadiplomaticpath thatwill lead MrKim togive up hisnuclearweapons. Butdiplo-macymayyetplaya role in crisismanage-mentand thusreduce the risksofa disas-trousmiscalculation. Thatmaybe what MrKim isnowanglingfor. 7North Korea’s missile programmeRocketmanextends a handAsuccessful launch and a plea forrespectfrom Kim Jong UnSources: IMF; The EconomistNORTHKOREAUpper limit13,000kmLower limit8,000km*ApproximateTarget audienceRange estimates* of North Korea’s latest missile testNovember 28th 2017“THE hardestbitofthe job ishavingenough sleep,” admitsMartanto, a29-year-old geophysicistatthe monitoringcentre forAgung, a volcano in Bali whichstarted eruptingon November25th.

Previouseruptions, in1843 and 1710-11, were similarlydestructive,saysDevyKamil Syahbana ofthe Volca-nologyand Geological DisasterMitigationCentre (PVMBG) in Bandung. MrSyahbana’scolleagueshave dividedthe archipelago’svolcanoesinto three cat-egories. The ﬁrst, ofwhich there are 69, areactive volcanoeswhich have erupted atleastonce since 1600 (see map). The secondare active buthave noterupted since 1600.The third are potentiallyactive openings inthe earth’scrust, such asfumaroles.

Thegovernmentissued the highestlevel ofalertand thousandsofpeople were evacu-ated—prematurely, itturned out. The deci-sion wasbased on the eruption of1963,which waspreceded bytwo daysofearth-quakesand produced calamitousﬂowsoflava and ash within fourweeks. Thistimearound, itisasifthe rockpluginside thevolcano had become “harder” after50yearsofdormancy, saysMrMartanto. Fi-nally, on November21st, a phreatic(steam-driven) eruption seemed to suggestthatmagma washeatingwateratthe top of thevolcano. On November25th the magma it-selfbegan to ﬂow.Eruptions, in short, are hard to predictwith precision. Sinabung, on the island ofSumatra, erupted suddenlyin 2010 andthen again in 2013 and 2016. Butbefore thatithad noterupted formore than 400 years.Asa result, PVMBGhad notbeen monitor-ingit, and those livingnearbywere not pre-pared to evacuate. Itisstill puﬃng away;thousandsofpeople have had to be per-manentlyrelocated.Even when volcanoesare known to beactive, and monitoringdata abound, it isnoteasyto judge howimminentorcata-clysmican eruption mightbe. Such deci-sions, saysMatthewWatson ofthe Univer-sityofBristol, require a “good deal ofexpertjudgmentundergreatuncertainty”.Call foran evacuation too early, and peo-ple mightdecide the riskisoverblown andreturn to theirhomes.MrSurono describeshowhe moni-tored Merapi, anotheractive volcano onthe island ofSumatra, foryears, conduct-inglongdiscussionsabouthowto evacu-ate those livingnearbyfrom theirhomes ifneed be.

Daniel Andrews, Victoria’spremier, and Jill Hennessy, itshealthminister, both said thatseeinga parentsuﬀerfrom a debilitatingillnesshad ledthem to supportthe law. Assisted dyingislegal onlyin Colom-bia, Canada, a fewEuropean countriesand some American states. MrAndrewssaysthe newlawisthe mostconservativein the world.

MrOwlerretorts: “It’snotaboutdoctors.

Some dis-missed the rumpusasa publicitystunt, an impression reinforcedwhen a stingoperation byIndian journalistsrevealed that, in ex-change formoney, the Rajputgroup cheerfullyoﬀered to attackanotherﬁlm production. Butasthe premiere of“Padmavati” ap-proached and extremiststhreatened to riot, politicians could notresistthe temptation to wade in. One afteranother, the chiefmin-istersoffourstateswith lotsofRajputvotersannounced thattheywould ban thisﬁlm thatinsulted the honourofthe imaginaryprincess. Uppingthe ante, the seniorspokesman in the state ofHaryana forthe Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP), which runsboth thestate governmentand the national one, said he would pay a re-ward often crore rupees(around $1.5m) to anyone who broughthim the severed head ofMsPadukone.MsPadukone’shead isprobablysafe, and “Padmavati” will, inall likelihood, still be released afteritsmakersagree to some smallchangeswith governmentcensors. Indeed, the publicitymaywell win itbigaudiences. Moreover, aftera prolonged and un-seemlysilence from the leadersofthe BJP, includingNarendraModi, the prime minister, the partyisexercisingsome restraint:the bloodthirstyspokesman hasresigned. Butthe lesson ofthecontroversyisnotthatsanityprevailed. ItisthatIndia’spoliti-ciansare all too happyto panderto extremistsentiment, how-eversillyitmaybe, so longasitﬂowsin a useful direction.With anotherelection alwaysaround the corner—MrModi’shome state ofGujaratgoesto the pollsnextweek—whychallengeamyth thatechoesone ofthe BJP’svote-winningwarnings, thatMuslim seducersare waginga “love jihad” againstvulnerableHinduwomen? Perhapsnotsurprisingly, in Gujaratitself itwasanotherﬁlm thatbrieﬂystirred more controversy. The anony-mouslyproduced clip, which waswidelyshared, showsa Hinduschoolgirl fearfullywalkingdown a darkened street, with theMuslim call to prayerreverberatingin the background. When sheﬁnallyreacheshome and fallstearfullyinto the armsof herpar-ents, a voice explainsthatin the past“we” were fearful, butnowMrModi ishere to protectus.Even India’sSupreme Courtappearsvulnerable to the tropeofa lurkingMuslim menace. In late Novemberitproduced a bi-zarre fudge in the case ofHadiya, a 25-year-old convertto Islamwhose Hinduparentshad persuaded a lowercourtto separateherforciblyfrom herMuslim husband and return herto the fam-ily, on the ground thatshe wasa victim oflove jihad. MsHadiyahasrepeatedlyand loudlydeclared thatshe wishesto be with herhusband. Butinstead ofrulingthatasan adultcitizen ofa secularrepublic, she had a rightto choose, theyordered herto go backtocollege and be placed underthe “guardianship” ofitsdean.There are manycountrieswhere, with questionsofbelief andcommunal identity, manypeople seem keen to suspend judg-ment, quash doubtsorsimplyto ignore bright, plain facts. Mythsare so much more energising, and those who insiston dreary evi-dence riskbeingcharged with sinsthatrange from killjoy pedant-ryall the wayto high treason. Thisisverymuch the case forIndiaand itsimmediate neighbours, butwith an added pinch of spice,which isthatpeople in poweroften showunusual glee in posingasdefendersoftradition, howeverthatmaybe deﬁned to suittheirpurposesand whateverthe consequences.

Butin the pasttwo weeks, real life inBeijinghasbeen tellingitin tragic form. Onthe eveningofNovember18th a ﬁre brokeoutata warehouse-cum-apartmentblockin a shantytown in southern Beijingpopu-lated bymigrants—poorworkersfrom ru-ral areasofChina whom districtoﬃcialssometimescall “low-end people”. Nine-teen migrantsdied, includingseven low-Beijingisnotforpeople like us,” said one.Volunteerswho provided sheltersto pro-tectthe newlyhomelessfrom freezing tem-peratureswere told to stop doingso. Meanwhile, the wealthierpopulationofSecond Space wasdealingwith itsownscandal. On November22nd eightparentsoftoddlersata costlykindergarten in Bei-jingﬁled a reportto the local police sayingtheyhad found needle markson theirchil-dren. Theyclaimed—albeitwithoutcor-roboration—thatthe toddlershad beenforced to swallowtabletswithoutexplana-tion and had been told to strip naked andendure “health checks” by“grandpa doc-tor” and “uncle doctor”. Allegationsofinexplicable crueltyhave a familiarring. In Octobersecuritycamerasata nurseryin Shanghai hadcaughtstaﬀforce-feedingtoddlersmustardand sterilisers.

Toachieve this, the authoritieshave beenbootingoutvulnerable people: migrantsfrom the countryside. Theirplacesof workare beingclosed down.

State media were in-structed to use oﬃcial bulletins“withoutexception”. (Such reportshave notdwelledon the miseryofthose evicted.) The line ofthe dispossessed snaked into the night,lookingforsomewhere to rest. “ItlookslikeSocietyLife imitates nightmaresBEIJINGIn the capital, scandals bridge a social divideChinaAlso in this section29Help for the propagandistsThe EconomistDecember2nd2017 China292listed in NewYork.

Apseudonymousarticle onWeChat, a Chinese messagingapp, com-pared the scandalsto the Second and ThirdSpacesofMsHao’stale. Itargued that “de-lusions” in the capital were being“foldedaway”. The article waspromptlydeleted.Despite censorship, angrycommentarystill appeared. On WeChat, legal scholarsdoubted the legalityofthe migrantevic-tions. “When youneed construction work-ers,” wrote a userofWeibo, a microblog-gingsite, “youcall them fellowworkers.When youdon’thave enough forthem todo, youcall them migrantworkers. Whenyouare through with them, youcall them‘low-end people’ and send them packing.”Unusually, some ofthe criticism hasbeen overtlypolitical. More than 100 peo-ple, includingpublicintellectuals, signed apetition sayingthe evictionswere illegal,an abuse ofhuman rightsand “clearlythegovernment’sresponsibility”. With heavyirony, anothercommentatorwrote thatjustone month aftera ﬁve-yearlypartycongressin Beijing, the citygovernmentwasprovidinga taste ofthe “splendid fu-ture” promised atthe gathering. Atthe congressMrXi argued that socialinequalityand the gap between rich andpoorwere the biggestproblemsfacing Chi-na.

Butto survivetheyneed to stayin the party’sgood books.So theyhave found waysofproducingpro-partyentertainmentthatispopular. Acommon technique isappealingto youth-ful patriotism. Agood example ofthe genre is“WolfWarrior2”, a ﬁlm released in Julyabout aChinese soldierin Africa who saveshun-dredsofhiscompatriotsand localsfromwicked American mercenaries. Itcloseswith an on-screen message: “Citizensofthe People’sRepublicofChina. When youencounterdangerin a foreign land, do notgive up!

The movie hasgrossed almost5.7bnyuan ($870m), ten timesasmuch asits(also big-hitting) “WolfWarrior” predeces-sor, released in 2015. Itisbyfarthe biggestbox-oﬃce hiteverin China and just shyofthe top 50 ofall time globally. The extraor-dinarysuccessof“WolfWarrior2” hasgrabbed headlinesin China, although onNovember25th itdid notwin a prize attheannual Golden Horse awardsin Taiwan,the Chinese-language movie industry’sequivalentofthe Oscars. Chinese mediaspeculated thatitspro-partymessage—hardlypopularon the island—mayhaveruled itoutasa candidate. The directorand lead actor, WuJing(pictured in characteratop a military vehi-cle), wasusinga tried and trusted formula.In 2016 “Operation Mekong”, aboutChi-nese soldiersbattlingan Asian drug-traf-ﬁckinggang, grossed 1.2bn yuan and wasthe sixth-biggestearneratthe Chinese boxoﬃce thatyear. Production and distribu-tion ofthatﬁlm were privatelyled. State media have praised “WolfWarrior2” and “Operation Mekong” forlaunchinganewera in the developmentofwhatareoﬃciallyknown as“main melodyﬁlms”,thatis, onesthatpromote the partyline.The partyitselfhad been tryingto achievesuch a breakthrough since the 1990s, whenitbegan encouragingstate-employedscreenplaywritersand directorsto mimicthe storytellingtechniquesoftheircom-mercial counterparts. Itachieved occasion-al successes, such aswith “The Foundingofa Republic” in 2009, butnothingon thescale of“WolfWarrior2”. Online, too, the private sectorhas takenthe lead.

An interim ﬁxwasto boostpaymentstandardsin problem areasto the 50th per-centile rent, ratherthan the 40th. Thisdidnotimprove matters. Despite the extraspending, neighbourhood povertyratesand housingqualitywere unchanged. TheSAFMR rule, which would have taken ef-fecton October1st, tooka diﬀerentap-proach, requiringcitiesto calculate rentsatthe zip-code level, ratherthan across an en-tire metro area. The evidence forchangingthe rulesispowerful.

Adultearningsshotup by31%, ratesofcollege attendancerose 32% and the incidence ofsingle par-enthood dropped by30%.Though HUDinsiststhatmore time isneeded to studythe rule, some cities havealreadytried itout, with promisingre-sults. In Dallas, which implemented a sim-federal programmeswith HUD funds, pri-vatelycomplain ofuncertainty.

Hersuppor-tersattributed the cause to the judge hav-ingbeen appointed byMrTrump. Theywere nothelped bya rulingin favour ofMrMulvaneyfrom the CFPB’sown legaldepartment.These are, however, still earlyinnings.Because the dispute goesbeyond conﬂictsin statutesto a constitutional issue, the“AppointmentsClause” in Article Two,which coversthe relative authorityof thevariousbranchesin forminga govern-ment, there isthe possibilitythatthis istherare sortofdispute thatisquicklybroughtbefore the Supreme Court. Iftheytake thecase, the justicesmayend up weighing inon simmeringdebatesoverthe powerandautonomyofadministrative agencies. Inthe meantime, there will be no shortage ofpolitical theatre, ifonlybecause many ofthe participantsﬁnd ituseful.

Norisa tendencyto attackallies, ortogive encouragementto racistgroups. OnNovember29th, though, the presidentachieved a rare triple. On wakinghe seemsto have grabbed hisphone to attackCNN,give airto an old conspiracytheoryandbroadcastpropaganda from a hitherto ob-scure band ofBritish xenophobesto his43.6m Twitterfollowers. Laterin the day hehad a go atBritain’sprime minister, There-sa May, whose oﬃce had earliercriticisedhim forthinkingwith histhumb. Onesound strategyforstayingsane in 2017 hasbeen to ignore MrTrump’stweets. Yetthismorningbarrage revealed traitsthatgo tothe core ofthe man in the Oval Oﬃce.One isan astonishinglackofcuriosityaboutwhere information comesfrom. Brit-ain First, whose nonsense the presidentretweeted, wasuntil thisweekatthe fringeofthe fringe offar-rightEnglish politics. Itsmembersare a haplessbunch, too bone-headed to conceal theiranimusagainstbrown people. The group’sleader, PaulGolding, wasexpelled from the slightlymore mainstream British National Party(BNP), which itselfismarginal (itgainedmore than 1% ofthe vote in onlythree ofBritain’s650 parliamentaryconstituenciesin the general election earlierthisyear). MrGoldingwasdeemed too racistforthe BNPwhen he picked a ﬁghtwith itsonlynon-white council member. MrGoldinghasataste foractual ﬁghts, too: he hasadmittedacharge ofassault. Ashardlyanyone inBritain had heard ofBritain First, neitherpresumablyhad MrTrump. Butthe groupsounded like America First, which musthave been ﬂatteringand therefore good.And itseemed to share MrTrump’sviewson Muslims, which wasgood, too. Thatwasall the information the presidentneeded before givinghisendorsement.Asecond characteristicisa thin skin.Despite the powerofhisoﬃce, MrTrumpoften feelspicked-upon. When MrsMay’sstaﬀrebuked him forthe Britain First stuﬀ,he could notresist: “Theresa, don’tfocuson me, focuson the destructive Radical Is-lamicTerrorism thatistakingplace withinthe United Kingdom. We are doingjustﬁne!” When MrTrump wasrebuked forcriticisingLondon’s(Muslim) mayorafter alethal terroristattack, histweetson thesubjectbecame more frenzied. MrTrumpfeltsimilarlyaggrieved when he wasde-nounced forhisequivocal response to awhite-supremacistmarch in Charlottes-ville (“manysides” were to blame).MrsMay, whose governmentbadlywantsa trade deal with America after Brit-ain leavesthe European Union, wastakingacalculated risk. Mostforeign leaders havealreadyworked outthatthe president re-spondswell to bigparadesand badlytowell-intentioned criticism. In MrsMay’scase, though, the rebuke wasworth it. MrTrump has, amazingly, managed to uniteMPswho can agree on little else right now,aswell asto promote interfaith dialogue.ProminentBritish Muslimswere joined incondemnation bythe Archbishop ofCan-terbury, Justin Welby. Britain’sChiefRabbi,Ephraim Mirvis, haspreviouslysaid hethinksMrTrump isa racist. Afterhis elec-tion win lastyear, discussionsabout a statevisitto Britain began. One stickingpointwasthatMrTrump wished the occasion tobe optimised forpomp: gilded horse-drawn carriagesand all. Itwasthoughtmore prudent, ifhe came, to helicopterhim in to the queen’sgarden, avoidingcrowdsofprotesters. Ifthe state visit hap-pened tomorrow, there mightbe a riot.The good news, fortransatlanticrela-tionsatleast, isthatMrTrump’stendencyto go aftersteadfastalliescan be put right,with a little stroking. Malcolm Turnbull,Australia’sprime minister, wasan earlyvictim, butAmerica’spolicytowardsit hasbarelychanged. British prime ministers areobsequiouslyparanoid aboutmaintainingwhattheysee asthe special relationshipwith America’spresidents. Moreover, thefoundation ofthe relationship isshared in-telligence and diplomacy, which isrela-tivelytweet-resistant. In fact, forMrs May,who istryingto negotiate the world’smostcomplicated divorce while hampered byunpopularityand a self-sabotagingcabi-net, a spatwith MrTrump could be justwhatshe needs.7Presidential tweetingAveryBritish rowDonald Trump’s rebuke to Theresa Maywas notjustanothertweetIn happier timesTHE nine justicesofthe Supreme Courtare used to applying18th-centuryprin-ciplesto an America thatwould bewilderthe constitution’sframers.

Assensitive asthat in-formation maybe, MrWesslerreplied, itdoesnotcompare to “a minute-by-minuteaccountofa person’smovementsand as-sociations” overweeksormonths.Justice Sonia Sotomayoragreed—andthen some. Carpentermayconcern onlycell-towerdata, but“a cell phone can bepinged in yourbedroom”, she said. “Itcanpingyouin the mostintimate details ofyourlife. Presumablyatsome pointevenin a dressingroom asyou’re undressing.”One daysoon, she mused, “a providercould turn on mycell phone and listen tomyconversations.” Given these imminentrisksto Americans’ privacy, Justice Soto-mayorgestured towardsa more robustap-plication ofthe Fourth AmendmentthanMrWesslerwasrequesting. ChiefJustice John Roberts, a conserva-tive, wasan unlikelyallyin thisline ofquestioning. When MrWesslersaid thatpolice should be able to see no more than24 hoursofcell-location data without awarrant, the chiefsuggested thatwarrant-lessaccessto even a smidgen ofdata mayviolate an individual’sprivacy, outﬂank-ingthe ACLUlawyerfrom the left.

Justice Gorsuch doubted that“the original understandingofthe consti-tution” sanctioned easyaccessto individ-uals’ location information—especiallyifAmericanshave a “propertyinterest” intheirown data. CitingJohn Adams, he not-ed thatone impetusforthe revolutionarywarwasthe government’suse of“snitchesand snoops” to spyon Americans. Open-ended “writsofassistance” gave authori-tieslicence to search anythingtheyliked,infuriatingthe colonistsand inspiring theFourth Amendment. ForJeﬀreyRosen, presidentofthe non-partisan National Constitution Centre inPhiladelphia, Justice Gorsuch’sapproachwassomewhatsurprising, ifreassuring. “Itsuggeststhathe, like hispredecessor Jus-tice Antonin Scalia, maybe a vigorous de-fenderofthe Fourth Amendmentrighttobe free from unreasonable searchesof ourdigital eﬀects.” Ian Samuel ofHarvard LawSchool agreed.

On August3rd 2016, itre-ported, justasthe presidential race wasen-teringitsﬁnal phase, the Russian foreignministrywired nearly$30,000 through aKremlin-backed bankto itsembassyinWashington, DC, with a remarkable de-scription attached: “To ﬁnance electioncampaign of2016”. Worse still, thiswasonlyone of60 transfersthatwere beingscrutinised bythe FBI. Similartransferswere made to othercountries. The storycreated a buzz, butnotofthe kind its au-thorshoped for. “Idiots. The Russian elec-tion of2016, notthe USone, youexception-alistmorons,” tweeted a prominentRussian journalist, pointingoutthat Russiatoo held parliamentaryelectionsin 2016and thatthe moneywasmostprobablysentto the embassiesto organise the poll-ingforexpatriates. Thiswasconﬁrmed bythe Russian foreign ministry. BuzzFeed up-dated itsstory, butdid nottake itdown. The authorofthattweetwasnotaKremlin agentbutLeonid Bershidsky, asharp-tongued writerforBloombergNewsand co-founderofVedomosti, Russia’sleadingbusinessnewspaper. “The Trump-Russia storyisbecomingsurreal,” he wrotein a follow-up column while also oﬀering adisclaimer: “I grewup and lived mostofmylife in Moscow. Myperspective isthatofa guyfrom Russia, who hatesthe currentgovernmentthere butlovesthe country it-self.” ForRussian liberals, the spectacle ofAmerican commentatorsimitatingtheKremlin, which haslongblamed everyproblem on America, isdispiriting.Such people have no illusionsaboutthe Kremlin, and mostofthem have beenon the receivingend ofitsdisinformationand repression. Leonid Volkov, the cam-paign managerforRussia’sforemostoppo-sition politician, Alexei Navalny, who—likehisboss—hasbeen in jail more than once,wrote recently, onlyhalfin jest: “I can’tbesilentanylonger…I understand thatAmerican societyand the liberal media,stucksomewhere between denial and an-ger, still cannotreﬂectupon and accept Hil-laryClinton’sdefeatin the election a yearago. Butthe investigation ofRussian inter-vention isnotjusta disgrace, it’sa collec-tive eclipse ofreason, it’slunacy.” Russianswho thinklike MrVolkovhave longlooked to America asthe modelofhowa free pressshould be. Forthem, itismaddeningto watch the newsorganisa-tionstheyso admire buildingMrPutin intoan all-powerful Bond villain, thereby ele-vatinghisstature amongthe manyRus-sianswho credithim with makingRussia ageopolitical playeragain. “Iftheyfearus,theyrespectus,” runsa Russian saying. Theaim ofMrNavalny’scampaign, bycon-trast, isto showthatthe kingisnaked, notto dresshim up in armour.Active measuresIn SeptemberMorgan Freeman recorded avideo promotingthe launch ofa non-proﬁtorganisation called the Committee to In-vestigate Russia. The Academyaward-win-ningactorspoke in a deep, deliberate toneasalarmingmusicplayed in the back-ground: “We have been attacked. We are atwar.” The committee includesactorsandformerspooks, includingJamesClapper, aformerdirectorofNational Intelligence,and Leon Panetta, a formerdirectorof theCIAand White House chiefofstaﬀ. “Imag-ine thismovie script,” intonesMrFreeman.“AformerKGBspy, angryatthe collapse ofAmerica and RussiaRed mistMOSCOW AND WASHINGTON, DCHowthe Russia investigation looks from Russia34UnitedStatesThe EconomistDecember2nd20172hismotherland, plotsa course forreven-ge…he setshissightson hissworn enemy,the United States. And like the true KGBspyhe is, he secretlyusescyber-warfare toattackdemocraciesaround the world…And he wins…VladimirPutin isthatspy.And thisisno movie script.” MrPutin almostcertainlydid not ex-pectMrTrump to win. Hisgovernment’scyber-activitywasmore a haphazard andpettyresponse to whatthe Kremlin per-ceived to be HillaryClinton’sinterventionin MrPutin’selection of2012. In contrast tothe cold war, when all “active measures”were designed and conducted through aspeciallydesignated departmentoftheKGB, some ofthe hackingand social-me-dia disinformation wasoutsourced to mer-cenariesand “patriotichackers”, asMrPu-tin described them. Asa result, saysMaxim Kashulinsky, the founderand pub-lisherofRepublic, a liberal newssite, manyRussianshave been genuinelysurprisedbyAmerica’sheavy-handed response towhatare seen inside the countryaspranks.ButMrPutin underestimated the shockthisrecklessbehaviourwould cause inAmerica. FormanyAmericans, the historyofRussia’sstand-oﬀwith the Westendedin 1991. “Bythe grace ofGod, America wonthe cold war,” George H. W. Bush told Con-gressa fewweeksafterthe collapse of theSovietUnion. ForRussians, bycontrast,aftera briefhiatusin the 1990s, state propa-ganda returned to depictingAmerica asthe arch-enemy.The Kremlin haslongargued thatit isunderan “information attack” from theWest. “In thisframe there isno space foranyidea of‘truth’ oruniversal values,” ar-guesPeterPomerantsev, an experton disin-formation atthe London School ofEco-nomics, in an article in the AmericanInterest. “All information iswar.” Byaccept-ingRussia’sframe ofreference, the West, heargues, reinforcesthe Kremlin’sline andampliﬁesitseﬀortsto showthatAmericaworksin the same wayasRussia.Duringthe cold war, the SovietUnionaimed to infectAmerica and the WestwithitsCommunistideology(orquasi-religion)and capture asmanymindson the left aspossible. Those Westernerswho opposedcapitalism played the partofuseful idiotsforthe Sovietregime. Today’sRussia hasthe opposite goal. Itprojectsno coherentideologyorreligion beyond a mixture ofauthoritarianism and nationalism, butaimsto portrayitsadversariesasbeing ascynical, corruptand conspiratorial as Rus-sia’sown leaders. Those who mimicthestyle ofthe Kremlin’santi-Americanismplaythe role ofuseful idiotsnow. Radio Moscow“NeitherRussia Today(RT) nortrollsare in-terested in reallyinﬂuencingUSaudi-ences,” saysVasilyGatov, a Russian mediaanalystand visitingfellowatthe Universi-tyofSouthern California, referringto theKremlin-ﬁnanced newsoutlet. “Theirgoalisto make the Western system assuch reactto theirwork.” Theireﬀectivenessisjudged(and rewarded accordingly) notbywhattheyactuallyachieve, butbythe level ofnoise theycreate in the American media.Russian propagandistsregularlyand glee-fullyrecite articlesabout“Russia’smen-ace”. RTisalreadycapitalisingon its image.Itsadvertisementin Lonon reads: “The CIAcallsusa ‘propaganda machine’. Find outwhatwe call the CIA.” BrandingRTa for-eign agent, asAmerica hasjustdone, maybe accurate—butitalso playsinto the Krem-lin’shands.From the Kremlin’spointofview, this isawelcome departure from the cool realismdisplayed byBarackObama, who dis-missed Russia asa regional powerand de-scribed MrPutin asa “bored kid in the backofthe classroom”. Fewthingsinfuriate MrPutin more than beingignored. He hasbeen tryingto getAmerica’sattention eversince, and appearsto have succeeded. Butthisrecognition carriesa heftyprice-tagforthe Kremlin. Asa result ofMrTrump’selection and MrPutin’sattention-seeking, Russia hasemerged asone of thefewbipartisan issuesin American politics.Thishasallowed both partiesto come to-getherto passthe bill on Russian sanctions.“Itislike Christmas-time forus—there isnowaywe could have passed thisbill throughthe CongressunderObama,” saysone Re-publican staﬀerin the Senate.The resultisthatAmerican policy to-wardsRussia issoundernowthan itwasunderthe two previousadministrations.George W. Bush looked into MrPutin’seyes; BarackObama followed Russia’sag-gression againstGeorgia in 2008 with a“reset”. MrTrump hasan unexplained af-fection forMrPutin, buthisroom to changepolicyislimited bythe toxiccloud aroundRussia’selection interference. Though MrTrump enjoyslongcallswith MrPutin, day-to-daypolicyhasbeenleftin the handsofprofessionalswith fewillusionsaboutMrPutin’sintentions.Fiona Hill, the authorofone ofthe mostperceptive booksaboutMrPutin, overseesRussia atthe National SecurityCouncil.Herboss, General H.R. McMaster, closelystudied Russia’sinvasion ofUkraine anditsuse ofdisinformation. The defence sec-retary, General Jim Mattis, leaned towardssupplyingUkraine with “lethal defensiveweapons”. “We need to manage tensionsand avoid accidental clashes,” one seniorgovernmentoﬃcial says. “Butwe are notlookingforanypositive agenda.” Youarenotgoingto reach outifyougetrepeatedlypunched in the face, the oﬃcial says. “Itisall aboutmanagingexpectations. The low-erthe expectations, the easiertheyare tomanage,” arguesa formeroﬃcial. The policyofno positive agenda, saysKirill Rogov, a Russian political analyst, de-privesMrPutin ofhisfavoured blackmail-ingtactic. “Histhreatsand aggression areonlyworth somethingifthe Weststepsbackand oﬀersconcessionsand resets inexchange forhim notescalatingfurther.”Thishasrepeatedlyallowed MrPutin topockethisgainsand presenthimselfas avictor. Ifhiscounterpartsrefuse to negoti-ate, these threatslose theirpotency. Aftertwo and a halfdecadesofinﬂatedhopesand expectationsforpeaceful coex-istence, America isbackto itsold cold-warpolicyofcontainmentand deterrence.One ofthe authorsofthatpolicy, GeorgeKennan, concluded in hislongtelegram of1946 that“the greatestdangerthatcan be-fall usin copingwith thisproblem of Sovi-etCommunism, isthatwe shall allowour-selvesto become like those with whom weare coping.” Thisisworth bearingin mindasthe Russia investigation rumbleson.7Bananas in pyjamasThe EconomistDecember2nd2017 UnitedStates35ASANillustration ofwhatailscongressional Democrats, NancyPelosi’srecentattemptto defend an 88-year-old partygran-dee who wasalleged to have shown up to workin hispyjamas,fondled generationsoffemale employeesand to have asked atleastone ofthem to “touch it”, ishard to beat. The Democrats’long-servingHouse leader, who ismerely77, had been asked onNBCaboutthe allegationsagainstRepresentative John ConyersofMichigan, the House’slongest-servingmember. She respond-ed bycallinghim an “icon”. Asked whethershe believed hisac-cusers, MrsPelosi blustered: “I don’tknowwho theyare. Do you?Theyhave notreallycome forward.” Atleastﬁve formerstaﬀersofMrConyers, who wasuntil thisweekthe rankingDemocrat onthe House judiciarycommittee and a force in the CongressionalBlackCaucus, had atthattime accused him ofinappropriate be-haviour. One had received a pay-oﬀfrom hisoﬃce funds.ThatMrsPelosi should be tarred bythe culture ofimpunitysexpestshave been enjoyingon Capitol Hill is, in a sense, cruellyunfortunate. Asa successful Speakerofthe House between 2007and 2011, and the ﬁrstwoman to ﬁll thatrole, she hasdone a lotforwomen’sempowerment. She wasalso quickto realise hererror.Heroﬃce putouta corrective statementshortlyafterwards andMrsPelosi hassince said she believesatleastone ofMr Conyers’saccusers, while in private she hasurged the octogenarian con-gressman to resign, ashe probablysoon will. Yetherinstinctiverefusal to condemn him also reﬂected anothersortofimpunity,fortoo longenjoyed bythe House Democrats’ aged and compla-centleaders, even astheirpartyhasbecome increasingly dimin-ished and resentful oftheircommand.Even ifthe Democratsdid noturgentlyneed to attract youngervotersto compensate forthe meltdown in theirworking-classbase, the factthatthe average age oftheirHouse leadership isover70 would seem problematic. Considerwhythisis, and itlooksfarworse. MrsPelosi and herfellowleadersare sustainedbya scleroticpatronage system, ofwhich herpandering to MrConyerswasindicative, which hasbanished accountability andfresh talentfrom the upperreachesofthe party. Forher part, MrsPelosi remainsin manywaysan impressive leader—she is a re-lentlessfundraiserand adeptcaucusmanager, atonce pragmaticand acceptable to the Democrats’ ascendantleft. Yetgiven thatherpartyisasunpopularasDonald Trump, and thatshe istheprime beneﬁciaryofone ofitsmain structural weaknesses, she isprobablydoingthe Democratslessgood than harm.The oﬀendingsystem isitselftestamentto the costof duckingdiﬃcultdecisions. Forwhile powerhasbecome increasingly cen-tralised in both partiesin recentdecades, the Democrats havemuddled thattransition bymaintainingsome ofthe architectureofa more fragmented past. Where House Republicanshave aban-doned seniorityrulesand imposed term-limitson the chairing ofcongressional committeesand subcommittees, forexample, theDemocratshave refrained. Those plumshave dulybeen capturedbya minorityofincreasinglyaged Democratsin safe seats, an ar-rangementthe well-organised blackcaucushasﬁercelyguarded.MostotherDemocraticHouse members, meanwhile, face in-creasinglyarduousﬁghtsforsurvival, in a toxicpolitical environ-ment, with little prospectofleadership anytime soon. Had Ba-rackObama won and hungonto the IllinoisHouse district heonce soughtto represent, he mightstill be waitingto advance be-yond the House energycommittee, where hisvanquisherin thatprimarycontest, BobbyRush, plieshistrade.No wondermanytalented Democrats, recentlyincludingRahm Emanuel, Kirsten Gillibrand and ChrisVan Hollen, havequitthe House atthe ﬁrstgood opportunity. “Atthe end ofeachcycle, youaskyourself, ‘IswhatI can achieve worth the personal,ﬁnancial and emotional cost?’” asksa formerDemocraticmem-berofCongress, who concluded itwasnot. House Republicanshave seriousproblemsoftheirown, butatleasta churn ofcon-gressional talent; the Democratsare bycontrasta stagnant pool.The resultisthatone ofthe bestreasonsforretaining MrsPelosi isthatthere isno one obviousto replace her. Thisisinsane. Dissatisfaction with MrsPelosi within hercaucusruns deep.On the basisofthe unprecedentedlystiﬀleadership challengeshe faced afterthe general election from Tim Ryan, a burly Ohio-an, atleasta third ofHouse Democratswantherout. Yet fewofthe dissidentsdare saypubliclywhyshe should go. Most blamethe Republicans—asMrRyan did—byarguingthatshe hasbe-come so demonised bythe rightasto be repellentto swing voters.Yetwhile thatistrue, and a source ofRepublican glee, there isnoproofithurtsthe Democratselectorally. Onlythree people matterin House races, the candidatesand the president. Given the Re-publicans’ appetite forpersonal destruction, moreover, Mrs Pe-losi’ssuccessorwould in no time be similarlytraduced. So hereare fourbetterreasonsforMrsPelosi to move on.Quitwhile you’re aheadFirst, no Democraticleaderhasbeen held accountable for nearlyadecade ofwitheringdefeatsforthe party, includingthe reduc-tion ofitsHouse representation to the lowestlevel since the1920s. IfMrsPelosi wasseriousin arguing, afterherConyers blun-der, thatpoliticiansshould be held to the same standard ofac-countabilityasthe restofus, she should belatedlytake the hit.Second, herpatronage nexusand controllingleadership style areobstaclesto the reform and infusion oftalentand ideas herpartyneeds. Third, on a related note, much ofthateﬀortshould be di-rected to reconnectingwith working-classvoters, atwhich MrsPelosi, who appearsto thinkthe minimum wage a boon for them,ratherthan a policyto help the lowestpaid, isill-suited. Fourth,hercontribution to the DemocraticPartyhasbeen immense. Itwould be a shame to sullyitbyoverstayingherusefulness morethan she alreadyhas.7Enough already, NancyThe Democraticleaderin the House ofRepresentatives causes more problems than she solvesLexington36The EconomistDecember2nd20171ONE custom in Mexico’sera ofone-partyrule wasthe dedazo (bigﬁnger),the president’schoice ofhissuccessor,who would inevitablybe electedto a sin-gle six-yearterm. The authoritarian rule ofthe Institutional RevolutionaryParty (PRI)ended in 2000, butthe dedazo returned onNovember27th thisyear, when EnriquePeña Nieto, the president, chose hisﬁnancesecretary, José Antonio Meade, asthe PRI’scandidate in the presidential election to beheld in July. Thistime, though, the dedazothatcountsbelongsto the voters.MrMeade’sselection beginsa seven-month race fora tough job. The nextpresi-dentwill have to deal with a soaring crimerate, angeraboutcorruption, a weakecon-omyand Donald Trump, who maybythenhave decided to tearup ordrasticallychange the North American Free-TradeAgreement(NAFTA) between Mexico, theUnited Statesand Canada. MrPeña’ssuc-cessorwill also have to decide whether tocarryon with reformsofthe economy, en-ergyand education thathe began. MrMeade isbyno meansguaranteed towin. On the contrary, AndrésManuel Ló-pezObrador, a left-wingpopulistwho hastwice run forpresident, isahead in mostpolls. Ifhislead holds, he will win the one-round election. Athird contenderisRicar-do Anaya, the head ofthe centre-right Na-tional Action Party(PAN), who isexpectedto be named asitscandidate in December. MrMeade will ﬁnd MrPeña’sendorse-mentto be a mixed blessing. The presidentie surveyafterhisnomination byGCE, apollster, 23% ofvotersbackhim, puttinghim sixpercentage pointsbehind MrLó-pezObrador. Thatisnota bad start, consid-eringthata third ofvotershave neverheard ofMrMeade. Yetto win he will need to perform ahorriblytrickypolitical balancing-act. Hemustattractvotersfrom the PAN, the PRI’slong-time foe. Withoutthem, “he istoast,”saysLuisRubio ofCIDAC, a think-tank. Atthe same time, he mustﬁre up the PRI’ssupportersand make use ofthe party’sfor-midable electoral machine. Yetjust11% ofPRImembersnamed MrMeade astheirﬁrstchoice to be the party’spresidentialcandidate.IfMrMeade hashisway, the electionwill be a referendum noton MrPeña’sre-cord buton MrLópezObrador, whom op-ponentsportrayasa Mexican version ofVenezuela’sNicolásMaduro (see Bello).AMLO, asMrLópezObradorisoftenknown, mixesjustiﬁed angeratthe corruptpolitical establishmentwith populistideas, such asmakingMexico self-suﬃ-cientin energyand food.He appealsmostlyto the halfofMexi-cansdeemed poor; ie, who make lessthan$79 a month ifurban (or$56 ifrural). MrTrump’shabitofinsultingMexico helps MrLópezObrador, since he isthe mostvocifer-ousnationalistamongthe main candi-dates. MrMeade’scross-partybackgroundbuttressesMrLópezObrador’sclaim thatthere isno diﬀerence between the big par-ties, and thatonlyhe can rescue Mexicofrom the “maﬁa ofpower”. Lately, MrLópezObradorhasall but dis-carded populistpolicies. On November22nd hisparty, Morena, published a 415-page manifesto thatpromisesnothingscarierthan more spendingon infrastruc-ture and social programmes(and no taxrisesto payforit). Histeam hasreleased aslicklyproduced biopiccalled “ThisisMe”, isthe leastpopularon record, with an ap-proval ratingof26% (though thatismorethan double whatitwasearlierthisyear).Votersthinkhe hasdone too little to ﬁghtcrime and corruption and, aftera conﬂict-of-interestscandal, theydoubthishonesty.Five outofsixvoterssaycorruptleadersare a “verybigproblem”. In October2,371people were murdered in Mexico, the high-estnumberon record fora single month.Thatmakesa mockeryofMrPeña’spledgein 2012 to halve the murderrate.The economyshrankin the third quar-terofthisyearaftera pairofearthquakes inSeptemberkilled more than 450 people. Acollapse ofNAFTAwould do furtherdam-age. Onlyone in eightMexicansthinks thecountryison the righttrackand nearly halfsaytheywould nevervote forthe PRI. Afewmonthsago some observersspeculat-ed thatthe partymightnoteven bother toﬁeld a seriouscandidate forthe presidency. Technocraton a tightropeButMrMeade iscertainlythat. In choosinghim, MrPeña wentforsomebodywith lit-tle political baggage and lotsofintellectualheft. MrMeade isthe ﬁrstcandidate foramajorpolitical partywho doesnotbelongto anyparty. An economistwith a doctor-ate from Yale University, he hasheld morejobsin the cabinetthan anylivingpoliti-cian, includingin the governmentofFelipeCalderón, who waspresidentfrom 2006 to2012 and belongsto the PAN.

NowVenezuela’sdictator-presidenthashisnewassemblyin place and the opposi-tion where he wantsit—divided and de-bilitated. Buthe hasanotherproblem: heisrunningoutofcash. Afteryearsofmismanagement, Vene-zuela’sall-importantoil industryis listinglike a shipwrecked tanker. According todata provided bythe governmenttoOPEC, oil production in Octoberaveraged1.96m barrelsperday(b/d), down 130,000b/d from September(and 361,000 b/dfrom October2016). Subtractoil suppliedforalmostnothingto Venezuelansand toCuba, and shipmentsto repayloansfromChina and Russia, and onlyaround750,000 b/d are sold forcash, according toFrancisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan energyeconomistatRice Universityin Texas.And although the oil price isup from itslowof2015, itisstill a little more than halfitslevel of2012.Because the regime’spolicieshave allbutcrushed otherbusinesses, oil now ac-countsfor96% ofexports. Despite a brutalsqueeze on imports, the governmentisstrugglingto service the debtspiled up byHugo Chávez, MrMaduro’slate predeces-sorand mentor. In OctoberStandard &Poor’s, a ratingagency, declared Venezue-la in “selective default”. ByOctober27ththe countrywasbehind on paymentsto-talling$1.5bn, ofwhich more than halfwasunpaid formore than 30 days.Latin America hasseen plentyofdebtdefaults, butthisone isdiﬀerent. “I decreeareﬁnancingand restructuringofall…Ve-nezuelan payments,” MrMaduro said. Heisfond ofissuingdecrees; he maybe sur-prised to learn thatcreditorscannot simplybe bossed around. He entrusted negotia-tionsto hisvice-president, TareckEl Ais-sami—a man ﬁnanciersin NewYorkcan-notdo businesswith because the UnitedStatessayshe isa drugtraﬃcker(which hedenies). RecentUSsanctionsalso meanthatAmericanscannotacceptnewbondsfrom Venezuela, asa debtrestructuringwould require.Some bondholdersare nowconsultingtheirlawyers, accordingto Francisco Rodrí-guezofTorino Capital, a broker. One oftheircontractual optionsisto “accelerate”defaulted bonds, requiringtheirimmedi-ate full repayment—and then to seekacourtorderto seize oil cargoesand otherassets. Theymayhesitate iftheythink thegovernmentwill tryto carryonpaying—some ofthe delaysare becausebankersarenowsubjectingVenezuelan paymentstoclose scrutiny. But“the ball isin the bond-holders’ court”, saysMrRodríguez.All thismeansitwasa funnytime forMrMaduro to choose to ﬁre hisoil ministerand the head ofthe state oil company,PDVSA. The newbossofPDVSA, ManuelQuevedo, isa general ofthe nationalguard, the paramilitarypolice who beatdown the protests. Hisappointmentcomesafterthe arrest, allegedlyfor cor-ruption, ofmore than 50 oil-industrymanagersclose to Rafael Ramírez, Chá-vez’soil supremo, who washimselfre-portedlysacked asVenezuela’sambassa-dorto the UNon November29th. MrQuevedo knowsnothingofoil—buthe isclose to Diosdado Cabello, a former armyoﬃcerwho isMrMaduro’schiefrival inthe regime. AnalystssayMrCabello haslongwanted to control the oil industry,the main source ofmoneyin Venezuela,since moneyispower.One prospectglimmersthrough thismurk. MrMaduro isbuoyed bythe gov-ernment’ssuccessin state elections in Oc-tober. Demoralised opposition votersstayed away, and the regime managed topersuade manypoorVenezuelansthat iftheydid notvote forthe government theymightnotreceive rationsofsubsidisedfood. Fraud mayhave helped. Byjailinguncompromisingopponents, MrMadurohastamed others. Although partoftheopposition isholdingtalkswith the gov-ernmentin the Dominican RepubliconDecember1st, there isno sign thatMr Ma-duro will allowthe presidential electiondue byDecember2018 to be free orfair.Rather, the talkin Caracasisthat hewill bringthe vote forward, perhaps toMarch. Havingsquared MrCabello, MrMaduro would run again. And he wouldspend a fewbillion thatmighthave gonetowardsdebtpaymentsto boostimportstemporarily.

David Davis, the Brexit secretary, says no

On this basis, there is no serious risk that
aircraft stop ﬂying or nuclear materials are

both sides can see how damaging this

Yet this idea of a “soft” no deal is not
persuasive. A no-deal Brexit would dam-
age other EU countries, but hit Britain hard-

a decision to walk out with no deal can be
harmonious. It would mean not paying

surely look to its own interests ﬁrst.
Brexiteers often forget that the EU is a le-
gal as much as a political construct. If Brit-
ain left with no deal and no transition, it
would fall out of all EU organisations, from
Euratom to the European Medicines Agen-
cy (EMA). The European Court of Justice
(ECJ) would lose jurisdiction. Even if all
sides wanted Britain to stay in such bodies,
it might not be legally possible.

Losers and losers
Oxford Economics has modelled the ef-
fects of Brexit with no deal and says that it
would lop a cumulative 2% oﬀ Britain’s
GDP by the end of 2020, equivalent to
some £40bn. That is far bigger than the im-
pact on other EU countries (see chart). Be-
fore the referendum, the Treasury forecast
even bigger losses of output. Such num-
bers are especially daunting when annual
growth forecasts for the next few years
have just been trimmed to as little as 1.3%

The EconomistDecember2nd2017 Britain492Trade after no dealWobblinginto the WTOITHASlongbeen an article offaith forhard Brexiteers: there isnothing to fearfrom the World Trade Organisation.Manyare suspiciousofthe compromisesthata free-trade deal with the EU mayentail, such asacceptingitsrules orevenitscourts. So whynotjustwalkout andtrade with the EUasothercountriesdo,on WTOterms?One answeristhatBritain’srelation-ship with the EUisfarmore intimate thanmostcountries’. The EUaccountsfor43%ofBritain’sgoodsexportsand halfitsimports. In services, which make up 80%ofBritish GDPand almosthalfofexports,the EUmarketiscrucial. Theresa May hasdismissed a Canada-style free-trade dealbecause itwould mean “restriction onourmutual marketaccess”. ShiftingtoWTOtermswould be worse still.Itisalso misleadingto claim that therestofthe world tradeswith the EUonWTOterms. The Institute forGovern-ment, a think-tankin London, notes thatall bigcountrieshave bilateral agree-mentson such trade-facilitatingmeasuresascustomsco-operation, data exchangeand standards. HosukLee-Makiyama ofECIPE, a Brussels-based think-tank, saysthatonlyseven countriestrade with theEUon WTOtermsalone—and theyaresmall frylike Cuba and Venezuela.In anycase, revertingto WTOrulesisnotsimple. Britain wasa founderof theorganisation butnowbelongsasan EUmember. To resume WTOmembershipindependentlywill require a division ofEUimportquotas, notablyforbeef, lamband butter. Aﬁrsteﬀortwasroundlyrejected bybigfood exporterslike Brazil,Argentina and America. The WTOpro-ceedsbyconsensusamongits164 mem-bers. Were Britain to leave the EUonacrimoniousterms, negotiatingitsre-sumption offull WTOmembershipcould be diﬃcult.Brexiteerssaytrade with third coun-trieswould be easier. Perhaps, but the EUhasfree-trade dealswith some 60 coun-tries, includingSouth Korea and Mexico,and isnegotiatingone with Japan. It willnotbe easyforBritain to “grandfather”these deals, especiallyifithaswalked outwith no deal, ifonlybecause doing sowould need EUagreement, too.Then there isthe WTO’s“most-fa-voured-nation” rule, which barsdis-crimination unlessitisallowed by a fullyregistered free-trade deal. Ifafter no dealBritain and the EUwanted bilateral tradeto staytariﬀ-free, both sideswould haveto oﬀerthe same privilegesto all WTOmembers. Servicesare barelycovered byWTOrules. Buteven here, were Britain toseekto keep trade in services, the sametermswould have to be given to severalcountrieswith which the EUhasfree-trade deals, includingCanada. Subjectionto WTOrulesmightyetprove more irk-some than Brexiteersrealise.Brexiteers claim thattrade on WTO terms alone would be justﬁne. WrongbyBritain’sﬁscal watchdog.The main hitwould come through low-ertrade. Brexitwith no deal would implytariﬀson 90% ofBritish goodsexportsbyvalue, accordingto the Confederation ofBritish Industry. Itreckonsaverage tariﬀswould be 4.3% on exportsand 5.7% on im-ports, with some industrieslike agricul-ture, carsand clothinghitmuch harder.And itsaysadditional non-tariﬀbarrierswould costthe equivalentof6.5% on ex-ports. Food priceswould also rise: by some2.7% foraﬀected goods, saysa studyby theResolution Foundation, a think-tank, andSussexUniversity—and the poorwouldsuﬀerthe most. Afallingpound after a no-deal Brexitcould push inﬂation up more.Customswould create huge problems.Anewcomputersystem isunlikelyto bereadybefore early2019 and could anywaynotcope with a quintuplingofcustomsdeclarationsto 250m a year. An extra twominutes’ delayforlorriesatDover, a con-servative guess, would mean longqueues.Even ifthe British were prepared, othersmightnotbe. Tailbackson motorwaysinKentin 2015 were caused byproblemsinCalais, notDover. Brexitwith no dealwould also necessarilyimpose a hard cus-tomsborderin Ireland, causingmuch grief.EmergencystopCertain industriescould suﬀergravely. Brit-ain exports80% ofthe carsitmakes, overhalfofthem to the EU. Theycould losetheirEUcertiﬁcation aswell asfacing 10%tariﬀs, plus2.5-4.5% tariﬀson carcompo-nents, which move a lotin both directions.Honda hassaid thatitmaintainsonly halfaday’ssupplyofEU-made components, soanydelayswould be highlycostly. AstonMartin hassaid thatlosingEUcertiﬁcationcould mean itmighthave to stop produc-tion altogether.The pharmaceutical and chemicalsin-dustriesare also vulnerable. Betweenthem theyaccountfor10% ofvalue addedin British manufacturing. Fallingout oftheEMAand the REACHchemicalsdirectivecould make itimpossible forﬁrmsin theseindustriesto exportto the EU.

Outside Euratom,notonlywould nuclearpowerstations beunable to importplutonium, butimportsofradioactive isotopesthatare vital forcancertreatmentand are notmade in Brit-ain mighthave to cease.British-based airlinesare subject to EUrulesthrough the European Aviation Safe-tyAgency, which like all such agenciescomesunderthe ECJ. Ano-deal Brexitwould mean thattheycould no longerﬂylegallybetween Britain and the EU. Britainwould also fall outofthe EU’sbilateral air-servicesagreementwith America. Bankswould lose the passportthatentitles themto do businesswithin the EUoutofLon-don. There would be longlegal argumentsoverthe statusofmanyderivativescon-tracts. The BankofEngland hasatleast de-clared thatno British bankwould go underaftera no-deal Brexit.And then there issecurityco-operation.Ano-deal Brexitwould knockBritain outofboth Europol and the European ArrestWarrant(EAW), and also deprive itof ac-cessto manyEUdatabasesofsuspectedcriminalsand terrorists, includingthe pas-senger-namesrecord thatBritain did muchto promote. Intelligence-sharingmightcontinue bilaterally. Butbeingoutside theEAW, even ifonlytemporarily, couldquicklyturn Britain into the preferred ha-ven foranyEUcriminal, ratherlike Spainin the 1960sand 1970s.Whatall these examplessuggestis thatano-deal Brexitwould be riskyand costly.And thatunderminesthe credibilityof ano-deal threat. Yetitcould still happen byaccidentorpoortiming. Brexiteersmayclaim that, like forecastsbefore the referen-dum, the risksare exaggerated. Theyshould heed Anand Menon, directorofUKin a ChangingEurope, an academicnet-work: “Thistime, ProjectFearwould not bescaremongering.” 750BritainThe EconomistDecember2nd2017ANIRONlawofBritish life these daysisthat, however badthingsseem, the realityisworse. The recentbudget sharplydowngraded already-weakforecastsofeconomicgrowth. Realwagesmaynotrecoverto pre-crisislevelsuntil 2030. Nowtwonewpolitical books—“BettingThe House: The Inside Storyof the2017 Election” byTim Rossand Tom McTague, and “Fall Out: AYearofPolitical Mayhem” byTim Shipman—demonstrate thatthe country’spoliticsare even more messed up than itseconom-ics. The bookshave slightlydiﬀerentfocuses, the ﬁrst limitingit-selfto the election while the second studiesthe wider aftermathofthe Brexitvote. Buttheyare both equallydepressing.The ﬁrstillustration ofthe iron lawisthathowever bad a poli-tician Theresa Mayseemsto be, the realityisworse. She isdevoidofintellectual hinterland. Asked byaideswho were preparingherforan interviewto listherhobbies, she replied after somethought: “I do reallylike Sudoku.” She haslittle emotional intelli-gence. Confronted with a succession ofnational emergencies—the Manchesterbombing, the London Bridge terroristattack andthe Grenfell Towerﬁre—she failed to showanyhuman warmth.And that’s justforstartersMrShipman notesthatshe hasno “second gear”. Despite hislaid-backstyle David Cameron, herpredecessor, wascapable of shift-ingup a gearunderpressure. MrsMayismore likelyto applythebrakes. MrShipman notesthat“unexpected questionscreated abriefﬂickerin hereyesthatcombined furyand fear, somethingheraidescalled ‘the ﬂash’.” MessrsRossand McTague reportthat,when the election campaign started fallingapart, MrsMayturned up atConservative headquartersonlyto delivera stumpspeech. “I couldn’tbelieve it,” one activistsaid. “Thiswastheprime ministerofthe United Kingdom talkingin the middle ofanelection to herown campaign staﬀand she couldn’teven holdthe room. People were checkingtheirphones.” WalterBagehot, a19th-centuryeditorofThe Economist, described RobertPeel, whorepealed the Corn Lawsand introduced an era offree trade, asaman ofordinaryopinionsand extraordinaryabilities. Mrs May,who isleadingnegotiationswhich could be justasconsequentialforBritain’sfuture, isa woman ofordinaryopinionsand ordin-aryabilities, ifthat.The second illustration ofthe iron lawisthat, however dys-functional the DowningStreetmachine seems, the reality isstillmore chaotic. Britain hashad a problem forsome time with un-elected aideswho wield enormouspower: thinkofAlastairCampbell’srelationship with TonyBlair. Butthe problemreached newlevelswith MrsMay’sgovernmentbecause ofthecombination ofherpersonal fragilityand the concentration ofpowerin DowningStreetafterthe Brexitvote. Insiders quoted inboth booksargue thatMrsMaywasalmost“taken prisoner” byherco-chiefsofstaﬀ, NickTimothyand Fiona Hill. Mr Timothy, abearded intellectual, used herasa vehicle forhisOne Nationbrand ofConservatism, which sawBrexitasa chance to refocusthe partyon people ofmodestmeansand conservative instincts.The “chiefs” exercised ruthlesscontrol overaccessto Mrs Mayand had a special oﬃce, called “the bollockingroom”, fordress-ingdown oﬃcialsand even ministers.MrShipman providesan astonishingseriesofquotesaboutlife underthe chiefs. One insiderconﬁded thatDowning Streetwas“literallya shag-fest, with people drunkon powerand livingon the edge”. Anotherveteran said thathe had notseen “worsebehaviourfrom a senioraide in 25 years”. The chiefspublicly re-ferred to Philip Hammond, the chancellorofthe exchequer, as“the cunt”. Theyare thankfullygone, sacked (and, in MrTimo-thy’scase, shorn) afterthe disastrouselection. Butthe problem ofMrsMay’sweakleadership remains. The cabinetisdominated bycolourful personalitieswith passionate viewson Brexit, whileDowningStreetisdevoid ofideas.The third illustration isthathoweverfeeble Britain’sdefencesagainsta hard-leftgovernmentled byLabour’sJeremyCorbynseem, the realityisweaker. The mostworryingthingabout MrsMayisnotthatshe isan aberration, butthatshe isthe embodi-mentoftoday’sConservative Party. Campaign managerscalcu-lated thatthe numberofactive Torypartymemberswasabout50,000. In Brighton Kemptown, the local association consisted oflittle more than the candidate and hisfamily. Bycontrast Labourhashalfa million active members, mostlyyoungand ﬁred up.With itsgrassrootswithering, the Torieshave relied on highlypaid adviserssuch asLynton Crosby, an Australian, and Jim Mes-sina, an American. Butthese hired gunshave become out oftouch. MrMessina predicted thatthe Torieswould win 470 seats,givingthem a majorityof290. MrCrosbyrelied on roboticmes-sages(“Strongand stable”) and relentlessmicro-targeting(the To-riesdelivered 4,000 diﬀerentmessagesto Facebookusers). Bycontrast, Labourunderstood thatwearinesswith the status quoand the empowermentofactiviststhrough social media hadchanged the rulesofpolitics. Momentum, a pro-Corbyn pressuregroup, used ride-sharingappsto getactiviststo marginal seats. Itsshareable videoswere spread atalmostno cost: one in three Face-bookuserssawMomentum ads, despite the factthatthe groupspentonly£2,000 ($2,700) buyingadson the social network.

Itisalso likelyto puthard-leftadvisers such asSeumasMilne and Karie Murphyin the seatsthatwere once oc-cupied byMrsMay’spowerful, unaccountable “chiefs”. 7Amenu ofmiseryTwo newbooks suggestthatBritain faces some singularlyunappetising choicesBagehotThe EconomistDecember2nd2017511COLM STENSONdrivesaround CountyLeitrim, pointingoutnewtree planta-tions. In thiscornerofIreland, close to theborderwith Northern Ireland, conifersseem to be springingup all around. The en-croachmentisnotjustvisual. MrStenson,who isa police oﬃceraswell asa cattlefarmer, recentlyreceived a bill from hisfeed supplier. Itcame with a brochure ad-vertisingeasyreturnsfrom convertingfarmland into woods. Forestrycompaniestoutforbusinessin the local livestock mar-ket. The forestis“closingin”, he says. In the 1920s, when Ireland became in-dependent, itwasthoughtto have just220,000 acres(90,000 hectares) ofwoods,coveringabout1% ofthe land. Once-exten-sive forestshad been shrinkingforcentu-ries. Farmershad cuttreesforﬁrewood andto clearspace foranimalsand cropssinceatleastthe fourth millennium BC; sometree specieswere wiped outbydisease. Be-ginningin the 17th century, mostofthetreesthatremained were felled to buildshipsorfed into charcoal kilnsto ﬁre the In-dustrial Revolution. Today, though, almost11% ofIreland iscovered with forest, and an unknown ad-ditional amountbysmall woodsand scat-tered trees. The government’stargetistocover18% ofthe land area with forests by2046. Ireland isbehind schedule. Still,changesto food markets. Asthe bestfarm-ingareashave become more productive,and asrich countrieshave imported moreoftheirfood, marginal land hasbecomeunusable forordinaryagriculture. Some ofthe mostdramaticforestgrowth in Europehasbeen in high, dryplaceswhere farmersonce scratched a livingfrom goats, sheeporolives. Forestsnowcovertwo-thirds ofCatalonia, in Spain, up enormouslyfrom acenturyago. In America, the fastestexpan-sion overthe pastten yearshasbeen instatessuch asOklahoma and Texas, whichhave indiﬀerentsoils. “Good cropland isal-waysgoingto be good cropland,” saysThomasStraka, who followsAmerican for-estryatClemson University. But“a lotofland should neverhave been planted.”Forestsare also growingbecause gov-ernmentshave favoured them throughlawsand subsidies. Forest-boostinghas alonghistory, beginningwith a French for-estordinance in 1669. In Europe, wardrovepolicy: countriesneeded wood forwar-shipsand then, afterthe ﬁrstand secondworld wars, soughtto become self-suﬃ-cientin a bulkycommodity. In America, areadysupplyofcheap home-grown woodwasseen asessential forthe creation ofasuburban, home-owningdemocracy. Since the 1990senvironmental consid-erationshave weighed more heavily. For-estsare increasinglyvalued assponges forheavyrain, aswildlife habitatsand as car-bon sinks.

Some feel inadequate:European countrieswith scantforestcoversometimeslamenthowfarbehind the EUaverage theyhave fallen. about6,000 hectaresofnewforestoughtto be planted thisyear, while almost nonewill be lost. Itispartofa broad trend: theforestingofthe West.

In Britain,forestsare notliable forcapital-gains tax(though the land underthem mightbe). Ifaforestisboughtwith the proceedsof abusinesssale, the taxthatwould be pay-able isdeferred. Timbersalesincurneithercorporation taxnorincome tax. Forestscan be transferred to heirsfree from inheri-tance tax. And, whereasmanyfarm pay-mentsin the EUhave been decoupled fromproduction, forestsubsidiesreward plant-ing. The rate in England is£1.28 ($1.72) pertree, plusgrantsforfencesand gates. Mon-eydoesnotgrowon trees, goesone quip—treesgrowon money.Planted forestsare farfrom universallypopular, though. Between June and Octo-berthisyear, forestﬁresin Spain and Portu-gal killed more than 100 people and dark-ened Europe’sskies. The ﬁreswere partlyblamed on the spread ofnon-native trees,especiallyeucalyptus. ThatAustralian im-port, which wasplanted with supportfrom the World Bank, amongothers, growsso quicklythattreescan be harvested forpulp when lessthan ten yearsold. It alsoburnsreadily, scatteringembersfaraﬁeld.Portugal’sgovernmenthasbegun to re-strictplanting, in an eﬀortto prevent thecountryfrom turninginto whatone greengroup calls“Eucalyptugal”. The eucalyptustree isa scapegoat forabiggerproblem, arguesMarcCastellnou, aﬁre analystin Spain. The real trouble isthatforestsin Portugal and Spain have expand-ed quickly, with little thoughtforthe conse-quences. Well-managed eucalyptusplan-tationsare notthe biggestdanger—muchworse are ill-managed oneswith lotsofunderbrush and fallen wood, and the im-promptuforeststhatgrowon abandonedfarms. The ﬁresthatgetgoingin such for-estsjump to the treetopsand burn so ener-geticallythattheycannotbe stopped. In Ireland, the criticismsare diﬀerent.The country’sdefaulttree isthe sitkaspruce, a fast-growing, damp-tolerant coni-ferfrom America’sPaciﬁcNorthwest.Spruce plantationsare said to be devoid oflife—vertical desertsofdarkgreen. Theyare accused ofwreckingrural communi-tiesand drivingfarmersoﬀthe land. Andtheyare said to be outofplace in a mostlypastoral setting. GerryMcGovern, anotherfarmerin CountyLeitrim, putsitbluntly:coniferforestsare “notlandscape”. The ﬁrstcharge isfalse. MarkWilson ofthe British TrustforOrnithologysays thatconiferplantationssupportmore bird lifeperhectare than farmland, largelybecausetheyharbourmore insects. Inevitably,some birdsbeneﬁtmore than others. Themarch ofconifersacrossBritain and Ire-land hasincreased the numbersofpine-lovingbirdssuch assiskinsand crossbills.Conifersare also loved bycrows—which islessobviouslygood, because crowsraidthe nestsofrare birdssuch ascurlews. The second accusation, thattrees pushoutotherkindsofagriculture, isonlypartlytrue. Forestrysubsidiesand regula-tionshave indeed distorted Ireland’slandmarket. Farmerswho planttreesgetgener-ouspaymentsfor15 years, while continu-ingto receive ordinaryfarmingsubsidies.Atthatpoint, with perhaps20 yearsto gobefore conifersare harvested, theyoftensell to pension fundsand otherinvestors. Forested land in Ireland hardlyever re-turnsto farming. To help speed national af-forestation, the governmentrequiresthatland cleared oftreesmustbe planted withnewtrees(which are notsubsidised). Ire-land also barscommercial plantingon thepoorestsoils, where youngtreeswouldstruggle. Partlyasa result, forests havespread from the hillsto the lowlands, saysSteven Meyen ofTeagasc, Ireland’sagricul-ture authority. Macra na Feirme, whichlobbiesforyoungIrish farmers, argues thatforestpaymentsare nowpreventinggoodland from comingonto the market.Thatsaid, treesare sproutingin ruralIreland because farmerswantthem to.Manyown atleastone indiﬀerent, boggycornerofland where animalsgetstuck andonlyrushesgrowwell. Stephen Strong, afarmerin CountyMeath, hasplanted 80acresofhis500-acre farm with sitkaspruce, Norwayspruce, oakand ash. Thetreesrequire much lessattention than thesheep thatgrazed there before—“whereyouhave sheep, youhave trouble,” hesays. Forestryappealsespeciallyto ageingfarmerswho are lookingfora gentle exit. In2015, 45% ofnewlyplanted land in Irelandwasowned bypeople aged 60 orolder. The ﬁnal accusation, thatforests aredrasticallychangingthe appearance of thecountryside, isspot-on. Advocatesmaypointto a forested past. Butrural peoplehave become used to the landscape asit is,and often do notwantitto change. WhatworriesMrStenson, in CountyLeitrim, isnotjustthatthe ever-spreadingtrees willdisplace farmersand make ithard for himto acquire more land, butalso thattheywill preventhim from seeinghisneigh-bours’ lightsatnight. In America and Germany, people havebeen conditioned to see forested land-scapesassublime bypainterslike CasparDavid Friedrich and AlbertBierstadt. Irishpaintingand poetry, bycontrast, usuallycelebrateshills, bogsand farms. In “TheDeserted Village”, published in 1770 andprobablyinspired byscenesfrom hisbirth-place in Ireland, OliverGoldsmith lament-ed the transformation ofa livelyland-scape, studded with cultivated farmsandbusymills, into a silentone dominated by“gladesforlorn” and “tanglingwalks”.

Assetmanagershave deﬁned their mis-sion asmaximisingthe marketvalue oftheirclients’ portfolios,and in turn demand thatﬁrmsmaximise proﬁts.Eversince companieswere granted the privilege oflimited li-abilityin the 1850sa debate hasraged abouttheirobligations tosociety. In an article published in 1970, Milton Friedman, an econ-omist, made the case thata ﬁrm’sonlydutyisto itsbottom line.Thatisnotascallousasitsounds. Mostshareholdershave a mixofﬁnancial goalsand ethical beliefs. The proﬁt-hungry ﬁrm canbe partofa system thatsatisﬁesboth theirdesires. The companycreatesproﬁtswhich can then payforthe “ethical” objectivesthatashareholderhas: forexample, charitydonationsto help thepoor, ortaxesto payfora government-provided safetynet.Unfortunately, asMessrsHartand Zingalespointout, thisdivi-sion ofresponsibilitiesdoesnotalwayswork. Ifa supermarketproﬁtsfrom sellingmachine gunsto the mentallyunhinged, forexample, there isno action thatshareholderscan undertake withthose proﬁtsthatcan mitigate the ensuingdeaths. And ifthe gov-ernmentistoo dysfunctional to produce coherentpolicies, theremaybe no wayto oﬀsetthe externalities—massive job cuts in onetown, say—thatproﬁt-seekingﬁrmscreate. So sometimesthe onlywayto maximise shareholders’ over-all welfare maybe forthe ﬁrm to lookbeyond proﬁts. The authorsargue thatsome interpretationsofAmerican lawgive boards ofdirectorsmore room formanoeuvre here than iscommonly un-derstood. The nextstage isto ﬁnd outwhatshareholders want.Technologycould help, allowingindividualsto vote the sharesheld on theirbehalfbypension trusteesand investment funds.The authorsenvision shareholdersguidingthe broad direc-tion ofcompanystrategy.

Itwould be a plebi-scitaryshareholderdemocracy, more in tune with whatmanyAmericansthink, butmore dangerous, too.There are two bigrisks. One isthatthe combined voice oftensofmillionsofshareholdersbecomesa meaninglesscacophonythatno board can deal with. AsAndrewCarnegie, the 19th-cen-turyScottish-American tycoon, putit: “Where stockisheld byagreatnumber, whatisanybody’sbusinessisnobody’sbusiness.”The otherpitfall isthatshareholdersmanage to produce a clearenough voice, butthatthisvoice isstupid, ﬁckle orsinister. Thisisclearlypossible, too. Mostindividualshave little idea aboutthetechnicalitiesofrunningbigcompanies. In the investment worldretail shareholdersare often known as“dumb money” becauseoftheirtendencyto buyhigh and sell low.Shareholders’ valuesJustaspolitical democracyonlyworkswith checksand balances,the same istrue forshareholderdemocracy. MessrsHart and Zin-galessuggestthatfora proposal to be putto a digital vote byallshareholders, itwould need the supportofatleast5% to startwith. Anothersafetymechanism would be to make the votes ofordinaryshareholdersnon-binding. Boardswould have to notethem, butwould notneed to obey. Orpeople could investthrough single-issue funds, which are identical to normal fundsexceptthattheyguarantee to pursue a well-deﬁned goal—forﬁrmsto payhigherwages, forinstance, orto cutpollution levels.Plebiscitarycapitalism mayseem far-fetched.

No fewer thanﬁve lotsofrulesare aboutto come intoforce, are nearcompletion orare due foroverhaul. Theywill open up Europeanbankingto more competition, tighten ruleson trading, dentreported proﬁtsand boostcapital requirements. Although theyshould also make Europe’sﬁnancial sys-tem healthier, bankers—aftera decade ofever-tighteningregulation since the crisisof2007-08—maybe lessenthused. Startwith the extra competition. OnJanuary13th the European Union’supdat-ed PaymentServicesDirective, PSD2, takeseﬀect. Itsetstermsofengagementbetweenbanks, which have had a monopolyoncustomers’ accountdata and a tightgrip onpayments, and others—ﬁnancial-technol-ogycompaniesand rival banks—thatarealreadymusclingin.

Theyworrythatbankswon’tplayfair. Banks, fortheir part,have fretted thatopeningup theirsystemsrestricttradingin securitieson banks’ inter-nal venuesand force more derivativeshitherto traded “overthe counter” ontocentralised exchanges. Italso obliges banksto charge clientsseparatelyforresearch,ratherthan bundle itin with otherser-vices. Some are swallowingthe cost; someare cuttinganalysts.One wayoranother, the otherthreechangesare all aboutsafety. From Januarybanksin Europe (and manyotherplaces,butnotAmerica) mustapplya newac-countingstandard, IFRS9, obligingthem tomake provisionsforexpected loan losses,ratherthan waituntil lossesare incurred.Thatislikelyto knockearningsnext year.Mostbankssurveyed bythe EuropeanBankingAuthority, a supervisor, said theyexpected proﬁtsto become more volatile.The same could happen to lending.Floorpolished?Next, itseemsthatthe lastbigbitof Basel 3,asetofglobal capital standardsrevisedafterthe ﬁnancial crisis, mayﬁnally becomplete. Oﬃcialshad hoped foragree-menta yearago, buthagglingcontinued.The central-bankgovernorsand supervi-sorswho approve the standardsare due tohold a pressconference in Frankfurton De-cember7th. Surely, theywould notbotheriftheyhad nothingto say?Atissue have been the internal modelsbigbanksuse to calculate risk-weighted as-sets(RWAs). The lowerthe answer, thehigherthe ratio ofequityto RWAs, a keygauge ofcapital strength, and the less equ-itybanksneed. To limitthe discount fromthese models, Basel standard-setterspro-poseda ﬂoorforthe ratio ofbanks’ RWAes-timatesto those yielded bya standard ap-proach, atﬁrstbetween 60% and 90%.American negotiators, though theirbanksare little aﬀected, favoured a high ﬂoor andEuropeansa lowone ornone; the French mayexpose customersto fraud and them-selvesto lawsuits. On November27th theEuropean Commission adopted technicalstandardsintended to balance competi-tion and security. Although the directiveappliesfrom nextmonth, the standardsmaynottake eﬀectuntil September2019.Banksand theirrivalswill meanwhilehave to rub along.The standardsdemand thatcustomerssupplytwo outofthree typesofproof ofidentitybefore transactionsare approved:somethingtheyknow(a password orcode); somethingtheyown (a card oraphone); and somethingtheyare (eg, a ﬁn-gerprint).

Theymayallowthem accessthrough theironline customerinterfaces. Ortheycan build dedicated in-terfacesinto which the newcomerscanplugtheirapplications. Almostall banksare expected to choose the latter. To guar-antee fairplay, theymusthave a fallback, incase the dedicated interface fails.

So itisratherneatthat bitcoin,aprivatelycreated electroniccurrency,haslurched from $1,000 to above $10,000thisyear(see chart), an epicjourney toadd an extra zero.On the way, the currencyhasbeencontroversial. Jamie Dimon, the boss ofJPMorgan Chase, hascalled ita fraud.Nouriel Roubini, an economist, plumpedfor“giganticspeculative bubble”. Ordin-aryinvestorsare beingtempted into bit-coin byitsrapid rise—a phenomenondubbed FOMO(fearofmissingout). Boththe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Ameri-ca’slargestfuturesmarket, and the NAS-DAQstockexchange have seeminglyadd-ed theirimprimatursbyplanningto oﬀerbitcoin-futurescontracts.Itiseasyto muddle two separate is-sues. One iswhetherthe “blockchain”technologythatunderpinsbitcoin be-comesmore widelyadopted. Block-chains, distributed ledgersthatrecordtransactionssecurely, mayprove veryuseful in some areasofﬁnance, and be-yond. The second iswhetherbitcoin willbecome a widelyadopted currencyineverydaylife. Here the evidence is weak.Bitcoin can be used to buya fewthings. Buta currencyhasthree mainfunctions: store ofvalue; meansof ex-change; and unitofaccount. Bitcoin’svo-latility, seen when itfell 20% within min-uteson November29th before rebound-ing, makesitboth a nerve-rackingstore ofvalue and a poormeansofexchange.Imagine buyingan iPhone Xwith bitcoinin January. Youwould bynowbe cursingasthe same coin could buyten phones—Christmasgiftsforthe whole family.Acurrencyisalso a unitofaccount fordebt. Paul Mortimer-Lee ofBNPParibas, aFrench bank, tartlyremarks: “Imagine ifyouhad ﬁnanced yourhouse with a bit-coin mortgage.” Thisyearyourdebtwouldhave risen tenfold. Yoursalary, paid in dol-lars, eurosorwhatever, would nothavekeptpace. Putanotherway, had bitcoinbeen widelyused, the lastyearmight havebeen massivelydeﬂationary.Such issueswill be ofminorconcern tothose who managed to buybitcoin earlierin the year. Theywill justbe delighted withthe proﬁts. Butwhyhasthe price risen sofast? One justiﬁcation forthe existence ofbitcoin isthatcentral banks, via quantita-tive easing(QE), are debasingﬁatmoneyand layingthe path to hyperinﬂation. Butthisseemsa veryodd momentforthatviewto gain adherents. Inﬂation remainslowand the Federal Reserve ispushing upinterestratesand unwindingQE.Amore likelyexplanation isthat asnewand easierwaysto trade in bitcoin becomeavailable, more investorsare willing totake the plunge. Asthe supplyofbitcoin islimited bydesign, thatdrivesup the price.Butitisworth rememberingthatthecostofusingbitcoin isgoingup. Each trans-action hasto be veriﬁed by“miners” whoneed a lotofcomputingpowerto do so,and a lotofenergy: 275kWh foreverytransaction, accordingto Digiconomist, awebsite. In total, bitcoin usesasmuchelectricitya yearasMorocco, orenough topower2.8m American households. Allthiscostsmuch than processingcredit-card transactionsvia Visa orMasterCard.The minersare rewarded fortheir ef-fortsbybeingpaid in bitcoin; they are de-lighted bythe rise in the currency’sprice.Butsome are ﬁndingingeniousways tocutbackon theirenergycosts; one evenputcomputersin hisTesla carso he couldmine bitcoinsusingitsfree charging sta-tions. Much miningisdone in parts ofChina where electricityischeap.There are two waysofthinkingaboutthis. One isthatthe eventual price ofbit-coin will equal the marginal costof min-ing, which maybe risingbutiswell belowthe currentprice. The second isthat insti-tutionswill notwantto use the technol-ogyifitrelieson such a “Wild West” pro-cess; banksare alreadylookingatcheaperformsofblockchain technology. Whetherthe investorsdrivingtheprice higherare ponderingall this isopento doubt. Itlookslike a re-run of the dot-com craze.

The commission isalso exploringthecreation ofnewsecurities, backed by poolsofsovereign debtfrom all euro-area coun-tries, to weaken the linkbetween Euro-pean banksand national governments.With all thisto worryabout—oh, andBrexit—Europe’sbankersmaylookenvi-ouslywestward.

The mess,he complained, wasthe faultof“blue-eyedwhite people, who previouslyseemed toknoweverything, and nowdemonstratetheyknownothingatall”. Forhim the cri-siswasa repudiation ofAnglo-Saxon liber-alism and a vindication ofstate capitalism.Like manycountries, Brazil cutinterestratesand increased spending. Unlikemanyothergovernments, however, Bra-zil’sused itsstate developmentbank,BNDES, to funnel subsidised creditto Bra-zil’slargestcompanies. Thanksto cheaploansfrom the Treasury, the bankdoubleditslending, which reached a peakof4.3% ofGDP in 2010. Formostloansthe interestrateswere halfthe level ofSelic, the centralbank’sbenchmark.The plan worked, fora while. Brazilemerged from the crisisrelativelyun-scathed: aftera shortrecession in 2009 theeconomyrebounded with GDPgrowth of7.5% in 2010. Butthe stimulusoutlived therecovery, atan increasingcostto the tax-payer. Between 2009 and 2016 subsidiesfrom the Treasuryto BNDEStotalled 116bnreais($48bn). Brazil’sbigﬁrmsbecamehooked on cheap credit. Some have facedallegationsthattheyobtained the loansfraudulently.One, a meatpackingﬁrmcalled JBS, borrowed 8.1bn reaisfromBNDES; itwenton a spendingspree, buy-ingmeatproducersin America, Australiaand Europe, and became the world’slarg-estmeatpacker. BNDESballooned, too. Itnowaccountsfor15% oftotal lendingto theprivate sector; itsbalance-sheetisas bigasthe World Bank’s.Buttimeshave changed. Brazil is emerg-ingonlyslowlyfrom itsworst-everreces-sion, havinglostitsstatusasan invest-ment-grade sovereign borrowerin 2015. Itspublicﬁnancesare enfeebled: lastyear itrecorded a grossﬁscal deﬁcit(ie, includingdebtservice) of8.9% ofGDP.

In SeptemberBrazil’sCongressdecid-ed to replace thisrate with a newone,known asthe TLP, which will be setmonthlybythe central bankand indexedto ﬁve-yeargovernmentbonds.

Thiscould save Brazil’sTreasury0.25% ofGDPayear, predictsNeil ShearingofCapital Eco-nomics, a research ﬁrm.Noteveryone ischeering. BNDES’scus-tomerscomplain thattheircostofcapitalwill go up, threateningjobs. Raising the in-terestrate isalso likelyto reduce BNDES’smarketshare and so squeeze itsproﬁts,warnsMoody’s, a ratingsagency. Butthereform hasbeen welcomed bysmall andmedium-sized ﬁrms. Brazil’scentral bankiscurrentlyforced to setSelicatan artiﬁ-ciallyhigh level to oﬀsetthe impact ofBNDES’ssubsidised rate on the widerecon-omy.

The reform isan importantadvance inBrazil’sgovernment’seﬀortsto bringpub-licspendingand the ﬁscal deﬁcitundercontrol. Butitdoesnotgo nearlyfarenough in reducingthe deﬁcit.

Arecent studyforthe Vienna Institute forInternationalEconomicStudiesestimated thatwheretheyapplied to cheese, technical barriers,such aslabellingrequirements, loweredtrade volumesby6.7%. Sanitaryandphytosanitarymeasures, imposed onhealth grounds, lowered them by7.3%. Some rulesare designed to stop im-itation cheeses. Tryto exportBrie toFrance, orGorgonzola to Italy, and youwill meetmore lawyersthan cheese-mongers. Stilton hasthisprotection.UnderEuropean law, onlysixdairies inDerbyshire, Leicestershire and Notting-hamshire produce oﬃciallyrecognisedBlue Stilton.

Ithasinvert-ed—ie, long-term rateshave dipped belowshort-term ones—justbefore each ofthepastseven American recessions. Such aninversion remainsa longwayoﬀ, but somerate-settersseem waryofthe risk. In Octo-ber, RobertKaplan, presidentofthe DallasFed, said he did notwantthe federal-fundsrate to nudge up againstthe ten-year Trea-sury-bond yield. Likewise, PatrickHarker,hiscounterpartatthe Philadelphia Fed,warned in Novemberthatinvertingtheyield curve would “notbe a good thing”.Asthe Fed watchesthe market, so trad-ersstudythe Fed. The yield curve reﬂectswhere marketsexpectitspolicyto head—which theymightbe betterable to predictthan central bankersthemselves. Butlong-term ratesalso include the “term pre-mium”—the reward investorsrequire forlockingtheirmoneyaway, and fortakingthe riskthattheirforecastsare wrong. Ifin-ﬂation isunexpectedlyhigh, long-termbondholders’ returnsare reduced, andtheycannotproﬁtfrom the risingshort-term ratesthatan inﬂation surprise typi-callyprovokes. So partofthe term pre-mium iscompensation forinﬂation risk.Fallinginﬂation riskmightexplain to-day’sdroopyyield curve, accordingto a re-centnote byMichael Bauerofthe San Fran-cisco Fed. Price riseshave been oddlysubdued thisyear. Despite unemploymentfallingto just4.1%, inﬂation (excluding foodand energyprices) isonly1.3% bythe Fed’spreferred measure. Inﬂation expectations,asmeasured bysurveysofforecasters,have notfallen. Butinvestorsmayincreas-inglysee the main riskastoo little inﬂation,ratherthan too much. Ifso, the inﬂation-riskpremium should have fallen, andcould even turn negative. MsYellen seemssympatheticto sucharguments. Buttheyare notall thatcom-forting.

Ifbond marketsare signal-lingthatthe riskisin factdeclining, thatseemsto contradictrate-setters’ thinking. Otherthan inﬂation risk, the term pre-mium isa catch-all foranythingthat aﬀectsyields.

Theeuro area survived a hellish decade, and isnowenjoying an un-likelyboom. The OECD, a club ofmostlyrich countries, reckonsthatthe euro zone will have grown fasterin 2017 than America,Britain orJapan. But, sadly, although the currencybloc hasun-doubtedlyproven more resilientthan manyeconomistsexpect-ed, itisonlya little betterequipped to survive itsnext recessionthan itwasthe previousone.Europe’scrisiswasbrutal. Euro-area GDPisroughly€1.4trn($1.7trn)—an Italy, give ortake—belowthe level itwould havereached had itgrown at2% peryearsince 2007. Partsofthe peri-pheryhave yetto regain the outputlevelstheyenjoyed a decadeago (see chart). The damage wasexacerbated bydeep ﬂaws with-in Europe’smonetaryunion. Three shortcomingsloomed partic-ularlylarge. First, the union centralised money-creation butleftnational governmentsresponsible fortheirown ﬁscal solvency.So marketscame to understand thatgovernmentscould no lon-gerbail themselvesoutbyprintingmoneyto payoﬀcreditors.The riskofdefaultmade marketspanicin response to bad news,pushingup governmentborrowingcostsand addingto ﬁnancialstrains. In 2012 the European Central Bank(ECB) stepped in, de-claringthatto keep control ofitsmonetarypolicyitwas willing,asa lastresort, to buygovernmentbonds. Panicsubsided, bondyieldsdropped and the mostacute phase ofthe crisisended. Butthe euro-area economycontinued to languish in or nearrecession through 2014 because ofthe second ﬂaw. Duringseri-ouseconomicdownturns, central banksusuallycutinterest ratesto encourage newborrowingand investing, and governmentsswinginto action byrunninglargerbudgetdeﬁcitsto make up forfallsin private spending. When the ﬁnancial crisisﬁrst hit, theECB, like otherrich-world central banks, cutitsrates to nearzero;governmentscuttaxesand spentfreely. Yetthe euro area wastoface unique diﬃculties. The ECBwasconstrained byitsman-date—a 2% inﬂation ceiling(asopposed to the 2% targetcommonelsewhere)—and the inﬂuence ofthe inﬂation-averse GermanBundesbank. Notuntil deﬂation threatened could the ECBbeginstimulative assetpurchases, longafterothercentral banks.Governmentswere unable to compensate forthismonetary-policyinertia. The ECB’spromise to buygovernmentbondsthreatened to liberate euro-area economiesfrom the disciplineimposed bymarkets. European leaders, and Germanyin particu-lar, soughtto enforce sobrietythrough othermeans. The emer-gency-lendingprogrammesnegotiated with the mostbelea-guered economiesexacted heftybudgetcutsasthe price. Allmemberswere bound bya “ﬁscal compact” thateuro-zone lead-erssigned up to in 2012. Iturged memberstatesto keep deﬁcitswithin setlimits, balance budgetsoverthe longrun, and adoptplansto reduce governmentdebtto no more than 60% ofGDP.Adherence hasbeen incomplete, butthe short-term impact wasthatpublicborrowingfell sharplyacrossthe euro area between2012 and 2016, prolongingthe pain ofthe crisis. European leadersstill argue overhowto meetthe currencyzone’smacroeconomicneeds. Emmanuel Macron, the Frenchpresident, favoursreformsthatwould allowfora euro-area bud-getlarge enough to cushion the economyagainstshocks, and a ﬁnance ministerto oversee it. Realistically, such mechanisms areyearsawayfrom agreement, letalone implementation.Euro-DämmerungHappily, Europe’srecoverydid notwaitforsuch reforms, butthatmakesthem no lessessential. The euro-area rebound, in itsearlyyears, relied on exports. Crisisand austeritygutted domesticspending, and led to wage-depressinglevelsofunemployment.So troubled euro-area economiesbegan sellingmuch moreabroad than theywere buying; foreign consumers, in eﬀect,threwthe desperate peripherya lifeline. Strongglobal growthstill helpsEuropean exporters, butotherfactorsadd to economicmomentum. The severestbudget-cuttingisover. And falling un-employmentisbuoyingconsumerspending—particularlyin Ger-many, where the boom hasbeen longestand strongest. Growth workswonders. Abiggertaxtake makesdeﬁcit-reduc-tion easier; hiringand consumerspendingfeed on each other. Solongasmoderate oil pricesand strongglobal growth continue,Europe’seconomichealth will improve. Unfortunately, such tail-windscannotlastforever. The third and gravestthreat to the long-run survival ofthe euro area endures: the mismatch between thescope ofitseconomicinstitutionsand itspolitical ones. No European institution enjoysthe democraticlegitimacy ofanational government. Crisisdrove European institutional reformin areassuch asbanksupervision, butalso concentrated powerinunelected institutionslike the ECB—even though the ﬁscal com-pactwasnegotiated byheadsofgovernment. Withoutnew polit-ical institutions(which, in fairness, he also wantsin the form of aeuro-zone parliament), MrMacron’seuro-area budgetand ﬁ-nance ministrywould seem like more ofthe same.The euro area isin a political bind. Amongthe legacies ofitscrisisare nationalistpartiesacrossthe continent, rooted in angeratpain seeminglyinﬂicted byunaccountable European politi-cians. Anymove towardsgreaterEuropean integration lends cre-dence to theirwarningsoflostsovereignty. Butfailure to agree onsuch measuresraisesthe oddsthatthe nextdownturn will be abad one, which would also playinto nationalists’ hands.

Ifitdoesnotuse itscurrentgood fortune to re-model itself, the interlude will come to be seen in retrospect notasa momentoftriumph, butasa last, missed opportunity tobuild a euro zone thatcan survive. 7The second chanceA hole as big as ItalySources: Bureau of Economic Analysis; EurostatGDP, % change 2007-16302010010If GDP had grownat 2% a year20+–United StatesGermanyBelgiumAustriaNetherlandsEuro areaFranceSpainFinlandPortugalItalyGreeceEurope’s boom will notlast; ithad bettermake the mostofitFree exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchange67The Economist December2nd2017PropertyThe EconomistDecember2nd2017691ELECTRICcarsare clean, quietand, itseems, the wayofthe future.

Some countries, includingChina, Britain and France, are mootingbanson internal-combustion vehicles, totake eﬀectwithin a couple ofdecades.Notall formsoftransportare so easytoelectrify.

On theroad, thatisa problem which can be de-signed around. Fora machine thatmust liftitselfinto the sky, itismuch harder to solve. Butitisnotimpossible. Dozensof ﬁrmsare workingon electricallypoweredplanesofall shapesand sizes. Some resem-ble ﬂyingcars, such asthose which LarryPage, one ofGoogle’sfounders, isbacking.Othersare hovering, drone-like machinesthatcould operate asautonomousaerialtaxis(Uberiskeen on these). Pipistrel, aSlovenian company, alreadymakesa two-seaterelectrictrainingplane. Another two-seater, the E-fan, hasbeen ﬂown byAirbus,aEuropean aviation giant, although it re-unlike a jetdirectlypropellinga plane, itwould be highlyfuel-eﬃcient.Flighttestsare due to begin in 2020. Iftheyare successful, a second engine on theaircraftwill be replaced. The results, theteam hope, will provide enough data to de-sign a full-on hybrid-electricairliner with50-100 seatsfrom scratch. Such a planemightenterservice in 2030 orso. Otherplanescould be in the airbeforethen. Zunum Aero, a startup based near Se-attle, hopesto have its12-seathybrid-elec-tricairlinerreadyto ﬂyitsﬁrstpassengersby2022, helped alongbyinvestmentfromBoeing, an American aerospace giant, andJetBlue, a successful airline.Such aircraftwill, theirdesigners hope,serve asbridgesto fullyelectricplanes inthe future. Overcomingthe weightpro-blem will be tricky. Forbigplanesﬂyinglong-haul routes, full electriﬁcation mayneverhappen, although hybrid systemswould reduce theirfuel consumption. Butdesign changescan help. Airbus, forin-stance, thinksitcan blend itselectric mo-torsinto the aircraft’sfuselage to reducedrag. And electricpoweroﬀerssome ad-vantagesthatoﬀsetitsbigdrawback. Oneisthatcombustion enginesare notvery ef-ﬁcientatturningthe energyin their fuelinto motion. Instead, a greatdeal of itendsup wasted asheat. Ajetengine might man-age around 55% eﬃciencyduringa steadycruise atthe ideal altitude. Butthat numbercould fall byhalformore when taking oﬀ,climbing, landingand taxiingon theground, which iswhataircraftthatﬂy shortcentlyabandoned the project.The reason forthatbecame clearon No-vember28th, when Airbusannouncedsomethingmore ambitious. Ithasteamedup with Rolls-Royce, a British jet-engineproducer, and Siemens, a German electri-calsgroup, to converta small airliner into a“ﬂyingtestbed” to prove the feasibility ofhybrid-electricpropulsion. “We are enter-inga newworld ofaviation,” said FrankAnton, head ofSiemenseAircraft. Electricpower, he predicted, would prove to be assigniﬁcantto commercial aviation as theinvention ofthe jetengine.

Electricmotorsare also lighterthan jetengines, which helpsoﬀsetsomeofthe weightdisadvantage. And theycon-tain farfewerparts, which meansthey re-quire lessmaintenance, which isa big costin aviation. Those are all reasonswhyZunum plansto focus, atleastatﬁrst, on relatively shortroutes, where the eﬃciencygainsfromelectricmotorsare mostsigniﬁcant. Theidea, saysAshish Kumar, the ﬁrm’schiefex-ecutive, isto serve the hundredsofsmallAmerican airportsthathave been left be-hind asﬂightshave shifted to bigger hubs.The ﬁrm’saircraftwill cruise ataround550kph (340mph) and have a range ofabout1,130km (700 miles). Like the Airbusmachine, itwould use a single small jet en-gine in the rearfuselage to run a generatorthatcould powerthe plane’stwo 500kWfansand top up the batteries, which will bemounted in the wingsand designed to beswapped in forfresh onesafterlanding.Thisway, atsome airports, the turnaroundtime could be aslowasten minutes. The aircraft’srange, saysDrKumar,should increase overtime. Forbatterieshave anotheradvantage overfossil fuels:asa relativelyunderdeveloped technol-ogy, theystill have plentyofroom left forimprovement. Asproduction rampsup,led bythe carand electronicsindustries,batterycapacitiesare increasingand pricesare falling. Thisweek, forinstance, SamsungElec-tronics, a bigSouth Korean ﬁrm, said thatbyincorporatinggraphene—an ultra-thinform ofcarbon—into a lithium-ion battery,ithad managed to boostitsenergycapacityby45% and greatlydecrease the time need-ed fora recharge. Manyothernewbatterychemistriesare beingdeveloped. One pro-misingidea isa solid-state lithium battery,which replacesthe liquid electrolyte ofcurrentcellswith a solid substitute. Be-sidesoﬀeringmuch higherenergydensi-ties, such batteriesshould also be cheap tomassproduce. Those trends, thinksDr Ku-mar, would allowhisaircraftto increase itsrange to around 2,400km by2035, and per-hapseven ditch the on-board generator.Combiningall these beneﬁtsand draw-backsinto a single ﬁgure istricky. Paul Ere-menko, Airbus’schieftechnologyoﬃcer,saysa single-aisle hybrid electricairlinerwould be “safe, eﬃcientand cost-eﬀec-tive”. Zunum’sDrKumarisprepared to gofurtherand talknumbers. Forairlines, theimportantﬁgure isthe CASM—costperavailable seatmile. Thisisobtained bydi-vidingoperatingcostsbycapacity, mea-sured asthe numberofseatsin an aircraftmultiplied bymilesﬂown. Zunum claimsthatitsplane will have a CASMof8 cents.OliverWyman, a ﬁrm ofaviation analysts,reckonsthatthe average forAmerican air-linesin 2016 was11cents.

Asthe planetheated up, itsvastglaciersfell back. Al-mostimmediatelyafterwards(in geologi-cal terms, atleast) volcanicactivitysurged. Thatwasnothingnew. The geo-logical record hasplentyofevidence ofbigglacial retreatsthatare followed bymore frequentvolcaniceruptions. Gla-ciers, in otherwords, seem to suppressvolcanoes, which, bythe same token,ﬂourish in theirabsence. This, atleast, isthe case forreally bigclimaticswings. Whathasbeen less cleariswhethermore modestchangesin icecovermightalso aﬀectthe rate of erup-tions. Given thathumansare busywarm-ingthe planet, and therefore shrinkingthe few, relativelypunyglaciersthat stillexist, thisquestion matters. Itwould begood to knowifmore volcaniceruptionsmightbe anotherconsequence ofglobalwarming. In a paperjustpublished inGeology, Graeme Swindles, a geographeratthe UniversityofLeeds, suggests thatitwill—eventually.The ﬁne detailsofhowglaciersarelinked to volcaniceruptionsare un-known. Butvolcanologiststheorise thatpressure iskey. The idea isthatthe weightoflarge ice sheetscompressesthe crustand mantle below. Thatclosesup chan-nelswithin the rockthrough which mag-ma travelstowardsthe surface. Italsoleaveslessroom forsurface watertomake itswaydown into the rocks, where,assteam, itcan increase the pressurewithin magma chambers. Remove theice, bycontrast, and those processes gointo reverse.DrSwindlesand hiscolleaguesstud-ied layersofash from Icelandicvolca-noesthatwere deposited overIcelandand northern Europe duringthe relative-lymild period since the end ofthe ice age,aswell asvolcanicsedimentsfrom Ice-land itself. Theiranalysisrevealed anunusual period between 5,500 and 4,500yearsago when no ash from Icelandicvolcanoesfound itswayto Europe, andwhen the sedimentrecord from Icelandsuggeststhatno majoreruptionstookplace. When DrSwindlescompared thevolcanicrecord with the climate liter-ature, he found thatthe absence of erup-tionswaspreceded bya bigchange inatmosphericcirculation patternsabout6,100 yearsago. Thatwould have encour-aged Iceland’sglaciersto advance. Whenconditionschanged again a thousandyearslater, thistime to favourglacialretreat, volcanicactivitypicked up after afewhundred years. Based upon these ﬁndings, DrSwin-dlesarguesthateven minorincreasesand decreasesin glaciercoverprobablydo aﬀectvolcanicactivity, albeit with atime lagofperhapsﬁve orsixhundredyears. The modern world isalreadyrecoveringfrom itsown miniature glacia-tion, the “Little Ice Age”, which lastedfrom about1500 to 1850. Combine thatwith yetmore glacial melt, caused thistime byhuman-driven warming, and thecenturiesahead maybe noticeablyﬁerierthan those ofthe recentpast.Whyshrinking glaciers could mean more volcaniceruptionsHot to trotThe EconomistDecember2nd2017 Scienceandtechnology71ALLlife on Earth usesthe same fourchemical letters, known asbases, tostore geneticinformation in the form ofDNA. Three basesform a codon, a genetic“word” thatrepresentsone of20 naturalamino acids. Astringofcodonscan be readbythe machineryinside cellsand turnedinto longchainsofamino acids. Thesechainsfold up into proteins, which carryoutmanyofthe innumerable jobsneces-saryforlife.EarlierthisyearFloyd Romesberg oftheScrippsResearch Institute in La Jolla, Cali-fornia, and hiscolleaguesunveiled an en-gineered organism thatdoesthingsratherdiﬀerently. Theirbacterium storesinfor-mation usinga six-lettergeneticalphabetcomprisingthe fourusual bases(A, G, Cand T, oradenine, guanine, cytosine andthymine) plustwo artiﬁcial onescalledNaM and TPT3. In a paperpublished thisweekin Na-ture, DrRomesbergand hiscolleagues go astep further, bydescribinghowtheyhavecoaxed theirbacterium into makingpro-teinscontainingamino acidsthatare notfound in nature. Each unnatural aminoacid to be inserted isrepresented by a nov-el codon thatincludesone ofthe team’ssyntheticbases. In otherwords, their bac-terium can quite happilyread an entirelynew, human-created extension to the stan-dard geneticcode, and use the instructionsto produce proteinsthatno organism natu-rallymakes. The hope isthatone day thismethod could be used to make newdrugs,polymersorcatalysts.To make theirbug, the researchers hadto ﬁnd moleculesthatcould serve as theirartiﬁcial bases. The fournatural bases inDNApairup in a speciﬁcway: guaninebindsto cytosine and adenine to thymine.Double-stranded DNAisheld togetherbythe interactionsbetween thousandsofbasespairingup with theirpartnerson theopposite strand. The bindingrulesmeanthatwhen the strandsseparate during celldivision itispossible to constructnewcopiesofthe DNAusingthe existingstrandsastemplates. The team screenedthousandsofmoleculesto ﬁnd two thatwould pairup and be copied asfaithfullyasnatural ones. Theythen inserted into theirbacteriumagene (made from the fourstandard bases)thatencodesa transportprotein (found inPhaeodactylum tricornutum, an alga),which allowsthe bacterium to ship thenewbasesacrossitscell wall. In earlierwork, the scientistsshowed thattheir engi-neered bugcan incorporate the two artiﬁ-cial basesinto itsgenome, and will happilycopyDNAstrandscontainingthem when itreproduces.Three more stepswere necessary, how-ever, before the bacterium could actuallyproduce the newproteinsencoded byitsnovel bases. To make proteins, cellsﬁrsttranscribe a piece ofDNAinto anotherlongpolymercalled messengerRNA(mRNA).Asitsname suggests, thisisthe stuﬀ thatcarriesproduction instructionsto the ribo-somes, the cellularfactorieswhere pro-teinsare assembled. The team thusneededto make mRNAversionsofthe two syn-theticDNAbases. Once messengerRNAarrivesatthe ri-bosome, yetanotherchemical, calledtransferRNA(tRNA), getsinvolved. Its job isto carrythe required amino acid to the ri-bosome and attach itin the correctplace.Atone end ofthismolecule isa triplet ofbasesthatallowitto recognise a particularcodon. Itscargo isattached to the other.The cell’stRNAshad to be modiﬁed to re-cognise the novel codons. And the en-zymesthatload amino acidsonto pieces oftRNAalso needed tweaking, to be able tocope with the unnatural amino acidsthatare the ultimate pointofthe exercise. To demonstrate thatall thishad workedasplanned, the team instructed their bac-terium to make a modiﬁed version ofgreen ﬂuorescentprotein (GFP). Thatisamolecule found naturallyin jellyﬁsh, butwhich isnowwidelyused to tagother mol-eculesforstudysince, asitsname suggests,itﬂuorescesunderthe rightsortof light. Intheirﬁrstexperiment, theyshowed that anunnatural codon (speciﬁcallyA-NaM-C)could be used to inserta single molecule ofserine, a natural amino acid, into GFP. Intwo furtherexperimentstheytried insert-ingﬁrstone, and then another, artiﬁcialamino acid into GFP. The artiﬁcial aminoacidstheyused resembled natural onesbutcarried an additional chemical group,which allowed the researchersto identifythem. In both cases, theyfound thatmorethan 95% ofthe protein produced bythebacteria contained the syntheticbuildingblockin question.Asa nextstep DrRomesberghopes toextend the bacterium’sgeneticvocabulary.The two newbasesmean 152 more codonsare available to representnon-natural ami-no acids. Proteinsmade with synthetic in-gredientsshould be more easilytailored tohave desirable therapeuticproperties (tobe longerlasting, forexample, ormorepowerful) than the natural sort. Synthorx,abiotech ﬁrm based in La Jolla which DrRomesbergfounded in 2014, wassetup toexplore exactlysuch possibilities. 7Synthetic biologyLife is a six-letterwordAlab-grown bacterium features twonewletters in its geneticalphabetFour become sixSource: WHO*EstimatedGlobal malaria deaths*, ’0000200400600800200005101516231m216mNumber of cases*MALARIA has been a scourge for most ofhistory. In recent years, a good deal ofprogress has been made against the dis-ease. But, as the World Malaria Report2017, published on November 29th by theWorld Health Organisation, explains, thatprogress seems to be tailing oﬀ. The rea-son is unclear. Fingers are, however, beingpointed at a decline in a technique knownas indoor residual spraying (IRS). Thisinvolves coating the interior walls ofbuildings in malaria-prone areas withinsecticide, to kill mosquitoes that land onthem. The report says that the proportionof people at risk of malaria who are pro-tected by IRShas fallen from 5.8% in 2010to 2.9% in 2016. Again, it is unclear why. Itmay be an unintended consequence of thesensible policy of rotating, over the years,The war on malariathe insecticides used for IRS. This helpssuppress the evolution of insecticide-resis-tance in mosquitoes. But it often meansreplacing conventional pyrethroid insecti-cides with more expensive alternatives,which some people cannot aﬀord.72ScienceandtechnologyThe EconomistDecember2nd2017Repairing roadsAhole in oneINTHE grand scheme ofthings, pot-holesmayseem like a trivial problem.Buttell thatto the manymayorsand localpoliticianswhose successisjudged bytheirabilityto keep roadsfree of them.One such, Alfonse D’Amato, an Ameri-can politician, wasnicknamed “SenatorPothole” byhisgrateful constituents.

Ifthe waterrepeatedlythawsand refreezes,the hole can growquickly, especiallysince carswill worsen the damage astheydrive overit. Small potholesare anuisance; bigonescan damage cars, andeven cause fatal accidents. Better, then, to ﬁxthem while they arestill small. In practice, thatistricky. InAmerica, forinstance, both state andfederal governmentsﬁnd potholesbymanuallyexaminingvideo footage ofthecountry’s4.12m milesofroads. Thatisboth expensive and laborious. Oﬃcialsin KansasCityhave come up with abetteridea. AsBob Bennett, itschiefinnovation oﬃcer, describes, the city isusinga mixofsensorsand computeralgorithmsto workoutwhere potholesare mostlikelyto form. MrBennett reck-onshisnewsystem can anticipate pot-holeswith a successrate ofabout85%.Havinga listoflikelytrouble spots meanslessneed to spend moneyon surveil-lance, which allowsthe city’sroad-main-tenance budgetto stretch about30%furtherthan before. KansasCity’sinnovation wasborneofnecessity, saysMrBennett. Like manycities, itisstrapped forcash. Its road-maintenance budgetisenough to repairabout4% ofthe city’s6,400 milesofroadseach year, butthatisfarshort oftheroughly10% thatactuallyneed ﬁxing. So,in collaboration with Xaqt, a small ﬁrmbased in Chicago, MrBennettputcam-erasonto traﬃc-lightpolesand buriedpressure sensorsinto the road across the51cityblockswith the heaviestvolume oftraﬃc. Xaqtcombinesdata from thosesensorswith meteorological informationsuch astemperature, precipitation andthe like. Thatstewofdata isseasonedfurtherwith information such asthe dateon which the road waslastrepaired, thetype ofasphaltused, whetherthe roadlieson a busroute, and whetherit hasproved prone to potholesin the past. Thescheme hasbeen so successful thatMrBennetthopesto extend the sensors andthe statistical model to the entire city. The nextstep isto combine suchsystemswith data provided bycarsthemselves. Anumberofﬁrms, includingFord and JaguarLand Rover, are devel-opingwaysofusingforward-facingcameras(which are increasinglycom-mon on newcars) to detectpotholes, inorderto adjustthe car’ssuspension be-fore ithitsthem.

Thetakingofthe “ChibokGirls”, astheybe-came known, wasunplanned (the insur-gentshad reportedlymeantto grab foodand a brickmakingmachine). Butthe heistcatapulted a little-known conﬂictto inter-national attention. The #BringBackOur-Girlscampaign led bythe girls’ parentsandactivistshad the resonance needed to goviral: young, innocentand mostlyChris-tian girlsforced to convertto Islam byviol-entjihadists. Boko Haram knewthe girls’propaganda powertoo. Avideo itreleasedin 2014 showed more than 100 swathed ingloomyhijabs, chantingprayers.The ChibokGirlsbecame symbolsinotherways. Some escaped, otherswere letgo afternegotiationsand more than 100are still captives. Those escapeesgivenscholarshipsto studyin America weremade bytheirbenefactorsto talkendlesslyabouttheirabduction forfundraising ap-peals. The kidnap also allowed Nigeria’sincompetentarmyto strutasheroeson arescue mission (though the armyhasnotdirectlyrescued anyofthe girls). Italso obscured a much biggerproblem.More than 2,000 women were abductedbyBoko Haram between the beginningof2014 and spring2015, accordingto Amnes-tyInternational, and manymore since. AmajorityofBoko Haram suicide-bombershave been female, manyofthem girlsco-erced orbrainwashed into theirmissions.HilaryMatfess, a doctoral candidate atYale University, adeptlydismantlesstereo-typesand mythsin hernewbook, “Wom-en and the Waron Boko Haram”. Thatwarhasdisplaced up to 2.1m people and killedmore than 30,000 since 2011. Notall thewomen involved are victims. Manydecid-ed to marryinto the group, often againsttheirparents’ wishes. In a region wherejust4% ofgirlsﬁnish secondaryschool andmanywomen do back-breakingfarmwork, life asa stay-at-home Boko Haramwife receivingQuraniceducation can ap-peal. “There was100% bettertreatmentun-derBoko Haram,” a commander’swifewho had been “rescued” bythe armytoldMsMatfess. “There were more gifts, betterfood and a lotofsexthatI alwaysenjoyed.”Uncommonlyforan armed group,Boko Haram’sleaderspurportedlyforbidtheirsoldiersto commitrape, outside ofmarriage atleast, so manywomen havebeen forced to wed theircaptors. But hereMsMatfessprovidesvaluable context:more than halfofwomen in northern Ni-geria marrybythe age of16, and maritalrape isnotillegal.Meanwhile, women escapingthe jiha-distshave often fared no better. Nigeriansoldiersburn villagescleared ofBoko Ha-ram (ostensiblyto stop looting), and havebeen accused ofkillingmen and forcingwomen to become theirwives. Campsforthose displaced bythe warare rife withabuse, with repeated reportsofrape. MsMatfessisbestwhen weavingthestoriesofwomen with analysisofBokoHaram and Nigeria’sgenderpolitics. Butherargumentfor“gender-sensitive pro-gramming” in the humanitarian responsefeelslessthan equal to the enormous task.Nonetheless, hersisa welcome contribu-tion to a narrative thathasbeen domin-ated byoversimpliﬁed symbolism. 7Women and Boko HaramBoth sides ofthecoinWomen and the War on Boko Haram: Wives,Weapons, Witnesses.By Hilary Matfess.

indexhas risen by 20% from an almost seven-year low in January 2016. Soaring metalprices have pushed up the index, despitean oversupply of nickel earlier this year.Policy changes in China explain much ofthe rise. In an attempt to curb pollution,Chinese authorities have imposed pro-duction cuts which have helped increasethe price of aluminium (the largest singleweight in our index). The price of copperhas also risen this year in response tosupply disruptions in Indonesia andChile. Food prices have stagnated, how-ever, owing to a glut of wheat and oil-seeds. The stock-to-use ratio for wheat, ameasure of inventories, is forecast toexceed 36% this season, a 30-year high.82The EconomistDecember2nd2017WHENAntonio Carluccio arrived inBritain in 1975, nervousand tongue-tied, he found Italian food restricted most-lyto London’sSoho. There a fewtrattoriemade theirown pasta, and knewthatoliveoil wasnotmerelyforunblockingears. AtLina Storeshe could buyolives, panforteand dryspaghetti. Otherwise and else-where, whathe called “Britalian” foodheld sway: ragùthatwasjustﬂavouredmince, avocado served with a gloop madeofketchup and mayonnaise and, to ﬁnish,orangesin a sicklysyrup masquerading ascaramelata. All verydepressing.Three decadeslater, when Carluccio’swaslisted on the stockexchange and heand histhen-wife, Priscilla Conran, hadsold theirstake foraround £10m, hisnamewason the darkblue blindsof130 outletsacrossthe land. His23 booksand multipleTVserieshad made hiscurlywhite cap ofhairand ample girth synonymouswithreal Italian food, the sortthatmade yousigh and cry“Fantastic!”, like him, whenyoutasted it. In Carluccio’sCaﬀès, Britonscould notonlyeatin properItalian stylebutcould also buychilli oil, fennel salami,wild-boarsauce, squid-inklinguine.Though manychefs, writersand restaura-teurshelped promote the cause in Britain,hisname wasin the vanguard.Thislooked like successto mostpeople.ItwasPriscilla, though, who builtup theCarluccio brand, after1999, on the basisofhissingle restaurantin Neal Streetin Co-ventGarden. She wasthe businessbrain;he wasthe frontman, happyto do nothingbutseekoutperfectfoods. And hisnotionofsuccesswasverydiﬀerent. Itmeant,aftera slowstroll with hisdogthroughbare woodson a mistyNovembermorn-ing, uncoveringa mushroom from the leaf-litter, cuttingitoﬀ, weighingand savouringitand placingit, with reverence, in hisbas-ket. This“quiethunt” had been hispassionsince the age ofseven, and walkswith hisfatherin the Val d’Aosta. Forhim the fun oflivingin England wasnotso much celebri-ty, asthe factthatpeople knewalmostnothingoffungi and were even afraid ofthem. The woodswere full ofuntouchedtreasure: stoutboletes, high-capped mo-rels, oystermushrooms, tinyyellowchan-terelles. In Hyde Parkhe found a puﬀballasbigasa football, rightbeside the path. Whittling thumb-sticksMushroomingreminded him thatwhathemostenjoyed wasthe feel ofthings. Whenhe walked in the woodshe would alsoseekoutgood straightsticks, hazel for pref-erence, to whittle and slowlycarve intoproperthumb-sticksforuncoveringfungiorsimplyleaningon, handscrossed, to sur-veythe scene. When he wrote hisbooks hewould do so in pencil, craftingthem. Hewasa countryman; though hisfatherwas astationmaster, the familykeptpigsand agoat, and grewvegetableswhose fresh, in-tense ﬂavourhe neverforgot. Hismothermade bread, preservesand sausages, andwashisonlycookeryteacher. No chef’sdaintytrainingforhim. On television hemanhandled slabsofspeckand cheese likeatrue peasant, ﬂickingaside with impa-tience the frillypapercapson Carluccio’ssaucesto getatthe good stuﬀinside. So when he tookfull charge ofhis res-taurantin Neal Streetin the late 1980s, hismission wasmushroomsin all theirglori-ousvariety. Gradually, theycreptinto hismenus: turbotwith honeyfungus, su-preme ofpheasantwith truﬄes. (Hewould happilyshave truﬄe overalmostanything.) Atﬁrsthe had to pickeverymushroom himself, dashingoutbetweenservicesto hissecretplacesnearenough toLondon; laterhe found Polesto help him.Boxesofthe season’sdelightswould ap-pearoutside the restaurantand he wouldstand beside them, drawingon a fatcigar. He used fungi to teach British diners tobe more daringgenerally: to eata stewmade oflamb pluck, forexample. Mush-roomsalso showed thatthe bestthingswere transitory, seasonal, and had to beeaten asfresh aspossible. The same ap-plied to ﬁsh and vegetables: pickthemfresh, cookthem simplybutwonderfully,asfarmers’ wivesdid. Adish offried cepsand potatoeswasperfection, summinguphisslogan mofmof: minimum offuss,maximum ofﬂavour. “Abundantwine todrink!” wasall thatneeded adding.Mushroominggave him solace, too. Hislife, which seemed so jollyto outsiders,contained much sadness. The worstwasthe death bydrowning, at13, ofhisyoun-gestbrotherEnrico. He could notbegin todeal with the heavinessleftin hisheart ex-ceptbyforagingforwild thingsand pains-takinglyshapingthem into somethingelse.And he could notstayin histechnician’sjob orin Italy, though he had no idea wherehisfuture lay. He roamed Europe homesickforhismother’scooking. Hiseﬀortsto rep-licate itdrewin manygirls, butnone gavehim the familyand children he wantedmore than anything. Histhree marriagesall foundered. He loved the buzzand chal-lenge ofrunninghisrestaurant, butitclosed in 2007 when developersmovedinto Neal Street. Behind the jovial smile, heattempted suicide several times. The real problem, he knew, wasthatCarluccio the brand had come to obscurethe man. The glossystoreswere too far re-moved from handlingand makingthings.Theywere too farfrom the woodsand thejoysofgathering, butthatwasthe life thatwastrue to him. The motto he chose was innatura veritas. In Nature layhistruth. 7The mushroom manAntonio Carluccio, ambassadorforItalian food, died on November8th, aged 80ObituaryAntonio Carluccio
