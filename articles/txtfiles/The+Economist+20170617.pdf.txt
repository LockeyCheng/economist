Jean-Marie Fiévet, a ﬁreman, will joinherfrom a constituencyin DeuxSèvresin the west. Both are po-litical novices. Theybelongto La République en Marche!(LRM), the movementbehind Emmanuel Macron, who lastmonth also won hisﬁrsteverelection—and dulytookcontrolofthe Elysée Palace. Welcome to the revolution.AcrossFrance people have risen up againsta political classthatfailed them (see page 19). The ﬁrstround ofvotingfor thelegislature, on June 11th, suggeststhatLRM, which MrMacroncreated only14 monthsago, will win atleast400 ofits577 seats.The Socialistswill lose 90% oftheirdeputies, includingtheirleaderwho did noteven make the run-oﬀ. The Republicanswill hangon to more, buttheyexpected to win thiselection—until a fewweeksago, when LRM’svictorybecame asinevita-ble asthe blade slidingdown the guillotine.MrMacron oﬀersa fresh answerto the populardiscontentthathassweptthrough Western democracies. He promises anewpoliticsthatditchesdivisionsbetween leftand right. Hewantsto restore dynamism and self-beliefto France and, withGermany’shelp, to the European Union. And he isbeingwatched from abroad bypoliticianswho, in theirown coun-tries, cannotseem to make themselvesheard above the din.Forhisrevolution to succeed, he needsto have good ideas andthe abilityto carrythem through. Doeshe?Adiﬀerentkind ofrebelMrMacron isthe rightman atthe righttime. Voterstired ofFrance’sstale politicswanted an outsider. Although he comesfrom the establishment—he isa graduate ofan elite college, anex-bankerand an economyministerunderhispredecessor,FrançoisHollande—MrMacron hasneverbeen a partyman.He hasdesigned LRM to actasa breakwith the past. Half ofitscandidatesare newto politics. Halfare women. Ithas cam-paigned againstcorruption. In the outgoingassemblythe mostcommon age is60-70; the average ofLRM’snovicesis43. Whereasmostpopulistscleave to rightand left, the Macronrevolution isto the centre. He stealspolicieswithout preju-dice—from the right, a desire to free up marketsand businessesto create jobsand wealth; from the left, a beliefin the role ofgovernmentto shape, directand protect. In the battle betweenopen and closed, MrMacron isbroadlyforopen in both tradeand immigration. In French terms, he isan economicliberal.And, crucially, he isan optimist. FordecadesFrance hassuf-fered from the morose beliefthatpoliticsinvolvesstruggle, butno real solutions. Thatsabotagesreform: whygive up whatyouhave todayforsomethingworse tomorrow? Elsewhere inEurope, democracyoften seemsa joylesstransaction in whichvotersare asked to endorse politicians’ emptypromisesin ex-change forbeneﬁtcutsand shoddypublicservices. Somehow, MrMacron hasconvinced the French thatpro-gressispossible. He hashitbackagainstpopulisttaunts thatfree marketsare a concession to the bankersand the globalistswith refreshingpatriotism—whetherbycrushingthe hand ofDonald Trump orrestoringpomp to the presidency. Againstwarningsaboutimmigrantsand foreign competition, he as-sertsthatboth will invigorate France, notenfeeble it. To Euro-scepticswho accuse Brusselsofsuckingthe life outof the na-tion, he insiststhat, no, the EUmagniﬁesFrench power.Good ideasare notenough. MrMacron mustalso break thehabitof30 yearsin which France’sreformshave been blockedbythe hard left. Successrestson early, visible progress in twoareas—employmentand relationswith Germany.French unemploymentisdouble whatitisin Germany. Forthe under25s, itisstuckabove 20%. Firmsare reluctantto createpermanentjobsbecause ofhigh social chargesand because re-dundancyand dismissal are expensive and diﬃcult. Mr Mac-ron wantsto loweremploymenttaxesand to make workplacebargainingmore ﬂexible. Successin the labourmarket willhelp him win overGermany, which haslostfaith in France’sabilityto keep up. So will gettinga grip on France’spublicspendingand itsarmyofbureaucrats. Germany, often stand-oﬃsh, should give MrMacron the beneﬁtofthe doubt. He isthe best, and possiblylast, chance to create the impetus fortheeuro zone to shore up the structure ofthe single currency. LRM’slandslide makesthisprogramme more likelyto suc-ceed. MrMacron hasbeen lucky. Hischiefopponenton themainstream right, FrançoisFillon, wasfatallydamaged byalle-gationsofcorruption. LRM’svictorywill be ﬂattered byFrance’stwo-round votingsystem. AstrongEUeconomywillcreate jobs(ifhe isnotto jeopardise that, he needs to go easyonthe budgetcuts). AsTheresa May, Britain’shaplessprime min-ister, can attest, ﬁrm control ofthe assemblywill cement hisgood fortune (see leaderon nextpage). However, resistance will move to the streets.

Asa resultofthe inquiryinto sexual harassment, more than 20 employeesand executiveshave been dismissed. Uberisgoingto strength-en itsboard, which hasbeen underthe thumb ofMrKalanickand two others, who togethercontrol a majorityofthe votingrights; an independentchairman isplanned. The ﬁrm will dootherthingsdiﬀerently, too: more performance reviews, lessbooze and no sexbetween a managerand an underling. So far, so bleedingobvious. The bigquestion isover MrKa-lanickhimself. He said thisweekthathe will take an indeﬁniteleave ofabsence, in partto grieve forhismother, who waskilled in a recentaccident, and in partto “workon himself”.Uberissearchingfora chiefoperatingoﬃcerto help him to runthe ﬁrm when he returns. Ithopesall thiswill be enough to re-bootitsculture and itsreputation. In truth, thatis possible onlywith MrKalanick’spermanentdeparture. Atanynormal company, he would have been ﬁred bynow.He isculpable foritsfailings; itsculture wascreated in hisim-age. ButMrKalanickwill notgo unlesshe and histwo co-majorityshareholdersso decide. He can marshal argumentsthatUbercontinuesto thrive: itreported record revenues in theﬁrstquarterofthisyear. Yetifhe caresforUber’s, and hisown,long-term ﬁnancial health, a clean breakmakesmore sense.

Yetmore scandalsalmostcertainlylurk. Each onewill reinforce the idea thatUbercannotchange so long asMrKalanickremainsin charge.

In Toronto, one oftwo cities,alongwith Vancouver, where the boom hasbeen concentrat-ed, rental yieldsare barelyabove the costofborrowing, eventhough interestratesare atrecord lows. In itstwice-yearlyhealth-checkon the ﬁnancial system, published thismonth,the BankofCanada concluded that“extrapolative expecta-tions” are a feature ofthe market. In otherwords, people arebuyingbecause theyhope, orfear, thatpriceswill keep rising. Canada isnotalone. House pricesalso lookhigh relative torentsin Australia, where a fewcities, notablySydney and Mel-bourne, are booming. Pricesin some American cities, such asSeattle and San Francisco, have been risingmuch faster thanthe national market, which looksreasonablypriced.Common to all these citiesare buyersfrom emerging mar-kets, notablyChina, who have helped to drive a wedge be-tween the price ofhomesand the local fundamentalsof in-comesand rental payments.

Moderate Tories, in-cludingPhilip Hammond, the chancellor, and Ruth Davidson,who led the partyto successin Scotland, are speaking up foranexitthatkeepsBritain open to trade and migration—provokingfuryamongsome hardline Brexiteers. Othersare mellowingforfearoflosingtheirseats, followingthe lossof solid Toryconstituencieslike Kensington.The DemocraticUnionists, a Northern Irish partyon whichthe governmentwill depend in keyvotes, wantto minimiseproblemsatthe borderwith the republic, which maymeanstayingin the customsunion. The businesslobby, previouslyfrozen outbyMrsMayalongwith everyone else, isarguing forasofterexit, too. The upheaval empowerscivil servants, whoprivatelyfavourthe least-disruptive Brexitpossible.Negotiationswill be hamstrungbythe government’spre-cariousness. The talkswill lastuntil late 2018, perhapsbeyondMrsMay’ssell-bydate. So Britain needsto reach a cross-partyagreementon the basicprinciplesofBrexit, and then ﬁnd awayto make the consensusstick, whoeverisin power. SeveralseniorTories, aswell asthe Liberal Democrats, have proposedacommission to drawup a negotiatingmandate, rather astheEU governmenthave forthe European Commission. The mainobstacle isLabour, which seesno reason to make life easierforthe Tories. Yetsuch a commission maybe in itsinterest. Nailingdown the principlesofBrexitnowwould save itfrom havingthe argumentlaterin oﬃce; MrCorbyn, who hasnever shownmuch interestin the subject, would be free to focuson hisrevo-lution athome.The EU can improve the chancesofa sensible outcome. ItdoesnotwantBritain to emerge with a betterdeal than ithadasa member, in case thatgivesideasto Eurosceptics in othercountries. Butthe riskofanyone envyingBritain in its currentlunaticstate isslight. The EU should recognise thatthere re-mainsa grave riskof“no deal”, and do whatitcan to avert thatoutcome, which would be catastrophicforBritain and verybad foreveryone else. There have been encouragingcom-mentsfrom Emmanuel Macron, France’spresident, and Wolf-gangSchäuble, Germany’sﬁnance minister, thatBritain wouldbe welcome backifBrexitwere reversed. Butthatisstill unlike-ly; the focusshould be on limitingBrexit’sdamage.Meeting halfwayReachinga good deal will require time. So both sides shouldagree on a longtransition, in which Britain livesunder today’stermsuntil a trade agreementisstruck. Itwill also require ﬂexi-bility. The issue mostlikelyto scuppera mutuallybeneﬁcialdeal isfreedom ofmovement. Britain cannotexpectspecialtreatment, butoﬀeringita minorget-out, ofthe sort alreadyen-joyed bycountriessuch asNorwayand Switzerland, would al-lowa bettersingle-marketdeal forall. IfEuropean leaders re-fuse anycompromise, theywill make theirown citizenspoorer. Thatisno wayto build supportforthe principle offreemovement.Britain’sposition isappallinglyweak. The negotiations areaslikelyaseverto blowup before theygetgoing. But the chaosin Westminsterpresentsa rare opportunityto change thecourse ofBrexit. Both sidesshould seize it. 714LeadersThe EconomistJune17th20172SHORTLYafterhe tookover asChina’sleaderin 2012, XiJinpinghad some encouragingwords—atleast, so theyseemedto some ofChina’seternallybe-leaguered liberals. Itwasessen-tial, said MrXi, “to ensure thatall citizensare equal before thelaw, to respectand guarantee human rights, and to enable citi-zensto enjoyextensive rightsand freedomsin accordancewith the law.” Hisexhortation wasaimed atthe rapidlygrow-ingmiddle classthatwanted the CommunistPartyto rule withalighterand fairertouch. Withouttheirsupport, oﬃcialsfeared, the party’sgrip on powerwould be in jeopardy. ButitturnsoutthatMrXi iseven more fearful of givingthemiddle classfreerrein than he isofupsettingthem. Three yearslater, in 2015, he launched a sweepingclampdown on hun-dredsoflegal activists, the boldestofwhom state media labelsikelawyers. The term literallymeans“death bashing”, sug-gestingtheyare activistswillingto ﬁghtto the death in defenceofsociety’sunderdogs, such asfarmersand the urban poor. Re-portssuggestthe authoritiesare notjustjailingand harassinglegal practitionersand theirrelatives, butalso subjecting someofthem to appallingtorture (see page 27). MrXi still stressesthe importance ofthe “rule oflaw”, butitisclearhe meansto applythe term mostlyto businesses, andotherpartsofcivil law. Some oﬃcialsrecognise that itisbetterto give victimsofland grabs, corruption and bureaucratic in-competence redressin court, ratherthan have them protest onthe streets. StandardsatChina’slawschoolsare improving,courtsare becomingmore independentfrom local govern-mentsand judgesbetterqualiﬁed. Butthere are limits to suchchange. Someone accused of“subversion”—a charge often lev-elled atpeople who do nothingmore than persistently criticisethe authorities—can still expectshortshriftin the dock. Morealarmingforthe partyisthatthe same lawyerswho defendfarmers’ land rightsoften take up the casesofthose whose po-litical orreligiousbeliefsthe partyabhors, amongthem house-church Christians, devoteesofFalun Gongand dissidents. ToMrXi, the lawyerslooklike an organised, liberal-minded forcethatcould challenge the legitimacyofCommunistrule.Straitened byTaiwanMrXi worriesaboutthe precedentofnearbyTaiwan in the1970sand 1980s, when independentlawyersled a movementagainstitsthen dictatorship. Butsuch lawyers—fearless ofpowerand dogged in theirdefence ofsociety’sweakestmem-bers—are essential ifChina isto build the rule oflaw itneeds. In a Communistcountrythe boundarybetween the partyand non-political civil and commercial suitsisblurred. AstheChinese become richer, more ofthem will face situationswhere theywantto challenge a decision bythe state. The per-ception thatthere isone lawforcitizensand another forthepartywill lead to feelingsofunfairnessand resentment. When people knowthatthe lawdoesnotprotectthem, un-restisinevitable. In a rare demonstration on June 10th in theheartofShanghai hundredsofhomeownersprotested at asudden change in planningregulationsthatwould lowerpropertyvalues. Anxiousoﬃcialsarrested ringleaders; cen-sorsscrubbed mentionsofthe protestfrom the internet.To a rulersuch asMrXi the choice mayseem stark. Restor-ingChina’sgreatnessrequiresa predictable, well-run legal sys-tem. Butthe rule oflawwill strengthen independentlawyers.He would do well to followthe logicofhisrhetoricin 2012. Up-pitylawyerswill sometimestake on the party. Butas the eco-nomicboom fades, the greaterthreatto MrXi isthe anger ofcitizenswho feel notonlythatthe partyisfailingto make themricher, butalso thatitisusingthe lawto bullythem. 7Chinese lawChampions chainedAcrackdown on independentlawyers is a setbackforthe rule oflawin Chinaofpolicymakersto stop bubblesfrom inﬂating. Raisinginterestrates, which stand atjust0.5% in Canada,mightseem the obviousanswer. The economyisrecoveringand thisweekthe BankofCanada’sdeputygovernorhashint-ed thatratesmightclimb. Butseveral risesin succession mightbe needed to cool the housingmarketand thatwould proba-blysend the economyinto recession. The authoritieshave instead attempted to deal with theproblem atitssource. LastsummerVancouverimposed a 15%taxon foreigners’ house purchases. The city’spropertymarkethassince cooled. Butone eﬀectofthisextra taxhas been toshifthousingdemand to otherplaces, such asnearbyVictoria,and to Toronto, where house-price inﬂation isabove 30%. Theprovince ofOntario imposed a similartaxin April, promptingfearsofa price surge in Montreal. To improve the supply ofrental properties, Ontario hasalso permitted citiesto slap a taxon vacanthomes. Thatwill help, butitwill notsolve the pro-blem. There are tentative signsthatpricesin Vancouver are re-viving, suggestingthatthe taxthere hasonlydeterred foreignbuyerstemporarily. In anyevent, some foreign owners hope tosettle in Canada soon, and so will be entitled to claim a rebate. There isno fail-safe administrative tool forcurbing house-price booms. The bestcourse isto insure againstthe falloutfrom a house-price bust. Canada hasbeen more active in thisthan mostcountries. People with mortgagesabove 80% ofthevalue ofthe home on which itissecured are obliged to payforinsurance againstdefault. The underwritingstandards on suchmortgageshave been steadilytightened. Canada’sbiggestbankshave some protection againstpotential storms. They arehighlyproﬁtable and exceed international benchmarks forcapital (see page 60). Strong foundationsEven so, a furthertighteningofsuch macroprudential mea-sureswould be wise, notbecause itwould do much to slowthe rise in house pricesbutasinsurance againsttheir eventualfall.

Setin deep conservative country, the town isrun bya centre-rightRepublican mayor,Daniel Fasquelle, and voted overwhelm-inglyforFrançoisFillon, the Republicancandidate defeated in the ﬁrstround ofthepresidential election earlierthisyear. Forten years, MrFasquelle hasalso been a par-liamentarydeputy. Backin January, thetown expected to bringa welcome end toﬁve yearsofSocialistrule in France, and areturn to conservative order.Yetata ﬁrst-round balloton June 11th foranewparliament, the good folkofLe Tou-quetputan unknown entrepreneur, Thi-bautGuilluy, into the lead, pushingtheirmayorinto second place and a run-oﬀ voteon June 18th. MrGuilluybelongsto anarmyofnovice candidatesstandingforPresidentEmmanuel Macron’sparty, LaRépublique en Marche! (LRM) who, with-outpike orpitchfork, are mountingapeaceful revolution in democraticpolitics.MrMacron’spolitical movement,created just14 monthsago, took32% ofthevote, ten pointsahead ofthe Republicans.Thisputsiton course to win a crushing ma-jorityatthe run-oﬀwith more than 400 ofthe 577 National Assemblyseats(see charton nextpage)—one ofthe biggestunder theFifth Republic—thatwould squeeze the Re-publicans, sideline the farrightand farleft,and all butwipe outthe SocialistParty,which could lose 90% ofitsseats. ForLe Touquet, which considersMrMacron a local son, thiswould be a partic-ularlysymbolicvictory. He and hiswife,Brigitte, have a second home in the resort,were married there and are regularvisi-tors. The presidential jetlanded on Le Tou-quet’ssmall airstrip so thathe could vote atthe town hall. “Everyone knowshimhere,” saysa local bythe sea front: “He’sneverarrogant; people wantto give him achance.” The familylinkdoesnotstopthere. MrGuilluy’sdeputy, Tiphaine Au-zière, isMrMacron’sstepdaughter.The entrenchedOn a blusteryafternoon, MrGuilluycanbe found inland in the red-brickvillage ofRang-du-Fliers, beside hisyellowcam-paign bus. He isjoined byMsAuzière, a lo-cal lawyer, who turnsup on a bicycle. Thepairare up againstentrenched centre-rightvotinghabitsand networks, aswell as a re-silientfar-rightin rural parts. Farther east,Marine Le Pen, leaderofthe nationalist Na-tional Front(FN), topped votingin Hénin-Beaumont, where she isrunningforparlia-ment. “Thisconstituencyison the right,and everyone said itwasn’twinnable,”saysMsAuzière: “Butwe’ve had an incred-iblywarm welcome on the ground.”Before MrMacron waselected, manywondered howhe could everhope to gov-ern. The partyhad no deputies. The presi-dential campaign wasfocused on hisper-sonalityand political preferences, and itwasnotobviousthatthiscould transferinto a partyvote. Yet, on a wave ofdéga-gisme, ordesire to kickthe old lot out, theFrench are provingthe doubterswrong.First-round turnout, atunder50%, mayhave been lowerthan usual, butthe resultwasunambiguous. LRMhasalreadyfelledaforestofold-timers, includingBenoît Ha-mon, the Socialists’ defeated presidentialcandidate, and Jean-Christophe Cambadé-lis, the partyleader. Neithermade the par-liamentaryrun-oﬀ. The implicationscould be far-reachingand a case studyin political change. A39-year-old formerSocialisteconomyminis-terand one-time investmentbanker, whohad neverstood forelected oﬃce, Mr Mac-ron hasalreadydeﬁed all the unwrittenrulesto become presidentatﬁrsttry.

Buthisthinkingsharessome ofthat, notablythe value ofborrowingideasfreelyfrom leftand right, and the need toremake democraticpolitics. Hisunderly-ingidea isthatthe bigforcesshaping the fu-ture—technology, the freelance economy,the environment—no longerfall neatly intothe old ideological divide between left andright. Byseekingoutlike-minded peopleacrossthe spectrum, he hassoughtto re-align politicsalonga newfaultline: be-tween those in favourofan open society,trade, marketsand Europe; and, on the oth-erside, nationalistsadvocatingprotection-ism and identitypolitics.MrMacron isnotthe ﬁrstto try to forgearadical centre in France. Pastattemptswere made byJean Lecanuet, a justice min-isterwho, in a neattwist, campaigned forthe presidencyin 1965 with the slogan “uneFrance en marche”; JacquesChaban-Del-mas, prime ministerfrom 1969-72, advocat-ed a centrist“newsociety”; orFrançoisBayrou, a centristformerpresidentialhopeful who isnowMrMacron’sjusticeminister. Butthese all began on the centre-right, failed to gain traction, and were usu-allyframed asa questfora middle path be-tween Gaullism and Socialism.MrMacron, bycontrast, hasroots onthe left. He believesin a strongrole forgov-ernment, particularlyon investmentandeducation (though he wantsan overall re-duction in publicspending). And, like hisformermentor, Michel Rocard, centre-leftprime ministerin 1988-91, he seeksto workacrossthe partydivide. Hisambition isnotto create a middlingalternative to the leftand right, butto force a partyrealignment.Attitudesto Europe measure thisnewsplit.Arecentpoll asked ifvoterswould regretthe end ofthe European Union. AsGérardGrunberg, a political scientist, points out, amajorityofSocialist, LRMand Republicansupporterssaid theywould; mostofthe farleftand farrightwould not. The former,drawn from acrossthe partydivide, makeup the backbone ofMrMacron’spost-par-tisan support.So overwhelmingisMrMacron’sex-pected victorythatworriesare turning tohowto curb excessive power. Thisweek LeMonderan an editorial entitled “The chal-lengesofhegemony”, frettingaboutthe“non-existent” opposition.

When the debu-tantsstep into the National Assembly forthe ﬁrsttime, ﬂoorplansin hand, the faceofparliamentwill be transformed. Foryears, the countryhaslamented itsinabilityto breakthe ageing, pale, malegrip on parliament. The mostcommon ageband amongoutgoingdeputieswas60-70.Some 17% were over70.

Novice candidates in-clude businesspeople, teachers, doctors, 11farmers, two ﬁremen, a ﬁghterpilot, amathematician and a hairdresser. On social mediaThisrinsingoutofthe old political classwasa deliberate attemptbyMrMacron tocombatpolitical extremes. Dismayed bypoliticians’ failure to curb the rise of MsLePen’sFN, he argued thatconﬁdence inmainstream politicswould be restoredonlybycloser, more meaningful links be-tween deputiesand voters. “Whatdoesn’tworkanymore isthe partysystem,” he toldThe Economistlastyear: “We need to ﬁndfarmore directformsofexchange withpeople.” He launched En Marche! lastAprilto thateﬀect, usingsocial media to spreadthe movement, drawingpeople into poli-ticswho had previouslybeen putoﬀby thesect-like approach to partyactivism. The huge inﬂowofnewcomersiscleansing, butwill bringitsown diﬃcul-ties. Theywill soon have to learn the grub-by, and necessary, artofcompromise. Andthismaydisappointvoters. Tensionsinsuch a broad movementare bound toemerge too, testingitsunity. Fornow,though, the rejuvenated political line-upappeals, and in no small measure due tothe Macron eﬀect. Itisnotbychance thatunknown candidateshave pasted photosofthemselveswith the newpresidentoncampaign billboardsall overFrance. MrMacron’sﬁrstmonth, marked bymuchdiplomaticsummitry, hasgone down well.Hismuscularhandshake with DonaldTrump, histough talkin frontofVladimirPutin and the digniﬁed wayhe hasrepre-sented France, have won plaudits.

Whatismissingin France,MrMacron told Le 1, a newspaper, in a rath-erastonishinginterviewin 2015, “isthe ﬁg-ure ofthe king, whose death I fundamen-tallybelieve the French people did notwant.” The emptyfeelingatthe centre ofFrench democracy, he argued, wasonly oc-casionallyﬁlled bygreatleaders, such asCharlesde Gaulle. “Afterhim”, said MrMacron, “the normalisation ofthe presi-dential ﬁgure hasreinstalled an emptychairin the heartofpolitical life.”Up to a point, MrMacron can hope torestore conﬁdence athome byoccupyingthatseatand representingthe countrywith aplomb abroad. Hisresponse to MrTrump’sdecision to pull outofthe Paris cli-mate agreement, forinstance, wascleverlyjudged: a plea, in English, to “Make OurPlanetGreatAgain”.

The summermaybe quiet,butdemonstrationscould well markthereturn to workin September.MrMacron and hiscentre-rightprimeminister, Edouard Philippe, are treading aperilousline. Theireﬀortswill be keenlywatched byGermany, to see whetherMrMacron can restore French credibility oneconomicreform. In theirfavour, a moder-ate union, the Confédération FrançaiseDémocratique duTravail, isnowFrance’sbiggest. Led byLaurentBerger, and for theﬁrsttime since itwasoriginallyfounded in1919, ithasovertaken the hardline Confédé-ration Générale duTravail. MrMacron alsomade a deftappointmentin namingMu-riel Pénicaud, a formerhuman-resourcesdirectoratDanone, a food company, to belabourminister.The contextismore favourable too. MrMacron’sown election spoke ofpopularexasperation atthe immobilismeofthepasttwo decades. Economicgrowth hasbegun to pickup, forecastat1.4% forthisyearand 1.7% next, accordingto the Euro-pean Commission. Businessconﬁdence inMayreached itshighestlevel forsix years.Conversationsin the boardroom andaround dinnertableshave turned from la-mentingFrench decline to a sortofstunned delightatﬁndingthe country theobjectofinternational admiration. Nothingisguaranteed, even forMrMacron. The hard slogofreform will testhisskills, and hiscountry’snewgoodwilltowardshim. Butthe French have been in aform ofcollective depression, which hasdiminished theirown expectations. “Eversince I wasold enough to listen to politicalspeeches, I’ve heard thatFrance isin crisis,”wrote MrMacron in a bookpublished lastyear. Theyhave alreadysurprised theworld atthe ballotbox. On paperatleast,MrMacron’sreform planssound promis-ingtoo. “Finallywe’re nothavingthe ﬁngerpointed atusforfailingto trywhat othercountrieshave alreadydone,” saysLu-dovicSubran, chiefeconomistatEulerHermes, an insurer. Ayearago, onlythe touchinglyoptimis-ticbelieved thatMrMacron could take hispolitical adventure anywhere. Ithassuc-ceeded, ifanythingto excess. The youngpresident’slegacywill be secured ifhe candefythe scepticson economicreform too.Thatwould be a real French revolution.7Paris-Berlin relationsThe age ofMerkronFORGermany, Emmanuel Macron wasthe dream candidate. Where hisfar-leftand far-rightrivalsforthe presidencybashed Berlin, he defended it. During histwo campaign visitshe was, to quote oneGerman oﬃcial, “pitch perfect” on hiscountry’sproblems. Several ofMrMac-ron’sinnercircle are German-speakerswith close linksto Berlin. Withered Fran-co-German tiesare alreadyshowingnewsignsoflife. OrasAngela Merkel put it,quotingthe authorHermann Hesse, attheirﬁrstpressconference together inBerlin on May15th: “There’sa little magicin everybeginning.”Thatisaswell, asMrMacron has bigplans. He wantsto use domesticeco-nomicreform and concessionsto Berlin’scallsforprogresson defence integrationto regain Germany’strust, leadingto a“newdeal” between the euro zone’screditorsand debtors. Itwould include acommon budget, parliamentand ﬁnanceminister. “Expensive Friend” warned arecentcoverofDerSpiegel.Can he do it? German politiciansaredivided. Scepticsinclude the free-marketFDP, right-wingAfD, the Bavarian CSUand mostofMrsMerkel’sCDU, includingWolfgangSchäuble, herﬁnance minister.Supportersinclude the Greens, the social-istLeftparty, the Social Democrats (par-ticularlySigmarGabriel, the foreignminister) and Europhilesin the CDU. Thechancellorissomewhere in the middle,like publicopinion: a poll conducted byForsa in Mayfound 49% in favourof“activelysupporting” MrMacron’splansand 42% for“holdingback”. AFranco-German ministerial summiton July13th isexpected to generate bilat-eral projectson thingslike education andenergy. Nothingbigwill happen beforethe German election in September. Butthen, ifMrsMerkel obtainsthe solidvictorythatpollspredict, she will havepolitical capital to spend and, probably,herdeparture date in mind. MrSchäubleisnotexpected to hold on to the ﬁnanceministry, which could fall to the SPDorGreens(a coalition includingthe FDPwould be more hawkish). Thus, saysHenrikEnderlein ofthe JacquesDelorsInstitute in Berlin, wintercoalition talkscould be a “historicmoment, a chance toopen doorsto real euro zone reform.”The institute hasa plan, “RepairandPrepare”, illustratingwhatmighthappennext. Itstartswith “ﬁrstaid” measurestostabilise the euro bystrengthening theEuropean StabilityMechanism, itsrescuefund, and introducingrisk-sharingtosome national deposit-insuranceschemes. Nextwould come a wave ofco-ordinated structural reforms, to labourmarketsforexample, combined with ajointinvestmentfund. And ﬁnally, per-hapssome yearslater, a “federal mo-ment”: treatychange creatinga monetaryfund, budget, ﬁnance ministerand parlia-mentforthe euro zone, aswell asa com-mon deposit-insurance scheme.IfMrMacron cannotwin overtheGermans, it’shard to imagine a presidentwho could. Butthatmaybe hisgreateststrength: Berlin isaware thatMarine LePen isdown, butnotyetout.

Itfollowsthatno countrycan have diplomaticties withboth China and Taiwan, and thatthosewhich recognise Taiwan mustbe made toswitch allegiances. Thisdiplomatic war-fare wassuspended from 2008 to 2016,when Ma Ying-jeouwaspresidentofTaiwan, since he vaguelyaﬃrmed theidea thatthe two sidesmighteventuallybecome one.

The concern amongTaiwanese isthatPanama’schange ofheartwill spurfurtherdefectionsin theregion. The Chinese authoritiespointedoutthatthere wasa global consensusaround the “one-China principle”, andthatMsTsai should take note.ButChina’scampaign maynothavethe desired eﬀectin Taiwan.

Manyin MsTsai’sDemocraticProgressive Party, meanwhile, think thatshe hasbeen too emollientwith Chinaand should take stepsto assertTaiwan’sindependence. Theypointto the break-ingofthe truce asproofofChina’sma-lign intentions. MsTsai hascomplainedthatChina isdisruptingthe status quoand said thatTaiwan will notbowtothreats: “Oursovereigntycannotbechallenged, and cannotbe traded away.”Still, MsTsai isnotone forconfronta-tions. Instead ofﬂingingTaiwan into alosingbattle with China, hergovernmentsaysitislookingforwaysto build strong-er, albeitunoﬃcial, tieswith friendlycountriessuch asJapan and America.    TaipeiChina persuades Panama to breakdiplomaticties with TaiwanThere isn’t much Taiwanese shippingWHENMalcolm Turnbull, Australia’sprime minister, urged China earlierthismonth to respect“the sovereigntyofothers”, manytookitascriticism ofChi-na’sexpansive territorial claimsin theSouth China Sea.

In recentmonths hisrocketmen have ﬁred oﬀmissilesin one testafteranother, oftenwith the young, overfed dictatorgleefullylookingon. During hisﬁrsttwo yearsin power(2012 and 2013), North Korea launchedjusteightmissilesin total. Overthe followingthree years, therewere 15 testsa yearon average. The tempo hasrisen again thisyear, with ﬁve ﬁringssince May10th, when Moon Jae-in wasin-augurated aspresidentofSouth Korea. Rumoursofa fresh under-ground nucleartest, which would be North Korea’ssixth, aregrowing. Korea-watchersare increasinglywonderingwhat’sbe-hind the ballisticfrenzy.Asimple answeristhatonlyvigoroustestingcan advance acountry’smissile programme—and thatMrKim seesthe ability tolaunch nuclear-tipped missilesasthe keyto hisregime’ssurvivalin the face ofAmerican hostility. Rocketfailurescan be asimpor-tantin whattheyteach youassuccesses, and North Korea hashadplenty, with manymissilesblowingup atlaunch orsoon after.Butthe successesare striking, too. Lastyearthe North ﬁredwhatisthoughtto have been a solid-fuel missile from a subma-rine, a ﬁrst. Asimilarmissile waslaunched in February byland.Analyststhinkthisto be a bigadvance on North Korea’spreviousliquid-fuel rockets. Land-based missileswith solid propellantscan be readied forlaunch much faster, before enemysatellites ordronesspotthem. Theymayin future give MrKim a more cred-ible land-based missile force, able to lurkin cavesand then “popup to ﬁre when ordered,” saysPeterHayesofthe NautilusInsti-tute, an American think-tank.The North’smissileshave a range ofup to 1,200 kilometresorroughly750 miles—enough to hitSouth Korea and Japan, both ofwhich hostAmerican bases, butnotto reach the American main-land. Butin a new-yearspeech MrKim promised an inter-conti-nental ballisticmissile (ICBM), capable ofcrossingthe Paciﬁc. Heisnotthere yet. The North hasenough ﬁssile material forup to 20nuclearweapons. Butithasnotmastered puttingthem on a war-head and accuratelydeliveringthem.Asecond interpretation isthatthe testsare mainlyintended aspropaganda. Apocalypticthreatsgo hand in hand with missileand nucleardevelopment. “South Korea will be submerged in asea ofﬁre, Japan will be reduced to ashesand the USwill col-lapse.” thundered RodongSinmun, the rulingparty’schiefmouthpiece, lastmonth. Athome, such bombasticlanguage,learned from the Soviets, isintended to rallythe country behindthe regime in the face ofperceived threats. And since no peacetreatyeverended the Korean warof1950-53, the governmentcanmore easilyconvince North Koreansthattheyare on a war foot-ing. Abroad, the intentisto hide North Korea’simmense weak-ness: no credible nucleardeterrentyetdespite the recent progress,abackward army, a decrepiteconomyand a small, underfed pop-ulation. Hannah Beech in the NewYorkerlikensNorth Korea’spricklinessto a hedgehog’sevolutionarystrategyofshowing itsspinesto protectitspinkunderbelly.Itisall ofa piece with the notion, to which Western commen-tatorsfrequentlypander, thatthe Kim familyregime is unpredict-able and even irrational—handle with care! Yetboth Kim Il Sung,the regime’sfounder, and Kim JongIl, hisson, died ofpeacefulcauses—testamentto some good sense. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Unhasdeﬁed predictionsofa shortreign atthe time the callowheirsucceeded to the throne. Ruthlessnessisall. Sendingall potentialchallengersincludingyouruncle to be executed isa rational ap-proach to stayingin powerin the maﬁa world ofNorth Koreanpolitics. Ifoutsiderssee all thisasa sign oflunacy, so much thebetter: in the asymmetricwarfare between North Korea and theoutside world, a fearsome reputation can onlybe helpful.There isa third possible explanation forthe increased tests. MrKim maysense thattheygive him the bestpossible hand beforeAmerican and Chinese pressure force North Korea backto the ne-gotiatingtable. Donald Trump’sadministration hasbeen enlist-ingChina to squeeze itswayward ally. In response to Mr Kim’sICBMboast, the American presidenttweeted, “Itwon’thappen!”Thisweekhisdefence secretary, JamesMattis, declared North Ko-rea, with itsnuclearprogramme, to be the “mosturgentand dan-gerousthreatto peace and security”. Administration oﬃcials saythatthe threathasforced America to end yearsof“strategicpa-tience” and considerriskierstrategies. Itremainshard to imagine,in the absence ofan imminentthreat, thatAmerica would launchapre-emptive strike on North Korean missile sites. That wouldriska devastatingwaron the Korean peninsula and be ﬁrmly op-posed bySouth Korea. So the testsare likelyto continue. ButAmerica mayﬁnd waysto throttle the regime’sincome from aglobal networkoffrontcompaniespeddlingweaponsand mili-tarytechnologyin deﬁance ofinternational sanctions, or—betteryet—persuade China to curb North Korea’soil imports. MrKim’smomentofmaximum advantage maybe now.Who’s the crazyone now?There isyetanotherpossibility. WhatifMrKim seesthe Ameri-can governmentascrazyand capricious? He would notbe theonlyone to viewMrTrump in thatway. And MrTrump has boast-ed aboutAmerica’srecentmissile strikesagainsta Syrian airbaseand the deploymentofthe world’sbiggestconventional bombagainstthe Taliban. AsMarkFitzpatrickofIISS-Americas, a think-tank, writes, the rhetoricofdeterrence “isa double-edged swordifitincreasesPyongyang’ssense ofparanoia”. Itisperhapsalarm-ingthatthe onlyAmerican to whom MrKim talksisDennis Rod-man, an erraticformerbasketball starwho visited Pyongyangthisweek. With the two sidescommunicatingmainlythroughrhetoricand militarysignalling, whaton earth, MrFitzpatrickasks, could go wrong? 7Double-edged deterrenceWhatmaylie behind North Korea’s manicmissile-testingBanyanThe EconomistJune17th2017271For daily analysis and debate on China, visitEconomist.com/chinaTHE transformation ofLi Hepingfrom adark-haired, full-bodied healthymanto a gaunt, greyingone with pooreyesighttooklessthan two years.

Would MrXi’sChinese dream be so compelling?AnewstudybyStephen BroadberryofOxford University, Hanhui Guan ofPekingUniversityand David Daokui LiofTsinghua Universityin BeijingarguesthatChina hasindeed lagged behindEurope forcenturies. ItcompareslevelsofGDP perperson in China, England,Holland, Italyand Japan since around theyear1000. Itﬁndsthe onlyperiod whenChina wasricherthan the otherswasduringthe 11th century. BythattimeChina had invented gunpowder, thecompass, movable type, papermoneyand the blastfurnace. Butaccordingto MrBroadberryandhisco-authors, Italyhad caughtup withChina before 1300, and Holland andEngland by1400. Around 1800 JapanovertookChina asthe richestAsiancountry. Chinese GDP perperson fellrelentlesslyduringthe Qingdynasty(1644-1912). In 1620, itwasroughlythesame asithad been in 980. By1840, ithadfallen byalmosta third (see chart).These ﬁndingschallenge a hithertocommon beliefthatChina and Europehad similarlivingstandardsforcenturiesuntil the West’sindustrial revolutionbegan in the late 18th century: a pointoften referred to byhistoriansasthe“greatdivergence”. Thisview, promotedbyKenneth Pomeranzofthe UniversityofChicago, lendsmore supportto theparty’sunderstanding.Researchersused notto be able toworkoutGDP from 1,000 yearsago.AngusMaddison, an economichistorian,wasamongthe ﬁrstto try. Butthe re-search byMrBroadberryand hiscol-leagues, which scalesup local and priv-ate recordsto generate national accounts,oﬀersgreaterdetail. The ﬁrststudy ofBritain’shistorical GDP usingthistech-nique appeared in 2008. Itwasfollowedquicklybyotheronesfocusingon Hol-land, Italyand nowon China. Doubtsremain aboutthe qualityofthe Chinese data. Arecentstudyby KentDengand PatrickO’Brien ofthe LondonSchool ofEconomicsarguestheyare toofragmentary. Itishard enough comparingthe livingstandardsofdiﬀerentcountriestoday, letalone doingso in the distantpastwith farlessprecise statistics. MrBroadberryrespondsthatChina’shistori-cal sourcesare no worse than thoseavailable formedieval England. He alsonotesthatimperial China and early-modern Europe both used silverasa unitofvalue, facilitatingcomparison.Butthere remainsa vital diﬀerence ofscale. Italyand the Hollandwere therichestpartsofEurope in the 14th and 15thcenturies. Itmightbe betterto comparethem notwith China asa whole butwithitsrichestpart, the Yangzi delta, aroundmodern-dayShanghai. Ifyoudo that,England and Holland were still richerthan the Yangzi area in 1800 butthe pointatwhich theyovertookthe delta turnsoutto be around 1700. Thisisnotsodiﬀerentfrom MrPomeranz’sviewthatthe greatdivergence happened in the 18thcentury. Butitstill meansthe process hadbegun before the industrial revolution,which in turn impliesthatEuropeanwealth and Chinese povertycannotbeexplained byindustrialisation: they mustreﬂectinstitutional diﬀerences.MrXi would do betterto consider adiﬀerentsource oflegitimacyfrom his-tory: povertyreduction.

Visitinglastmonth,MrSessionslamented a 43% rise in mur-dersin 2016, to a record annual total. Her-oin-related deathswere soaringtoo, henoted. The attorney-general omitted thefall in propertycrime, and the nationwidedecline in violence thatpreceded the re-centspike. Still, he had a point: news inMemphisisa grislydrumbeatofshoot-ings, including, thisweek, thatofa two-year-old girl. He spoke longinglyofcom-munitiesin which “law-abidingcitizenscan live withoutfear.” In some American cities, the fear he de-scribed isreal. Butin Memphisaselse-where, anotherkind isabroad, too: fear ofMrSessions’sunforgivingviewson crimeand immigration. Advocatesofcriminal-justice reform worrythathe will ﬁll up pri-sonsand build newones, justifyingdraco-nian punishmentswith massaged statis-ticsand fallaciousreasoning. Activistsworryaboutvotingrightsand police over-sight. Immigrantsare layingplansfor theirchildren’scare in case theyare deported. Until recently, atleast, some of MrTrump’scriticsconsoled themselvesthathisadministration would be too disorgan-ised to have much impacton Americanlives, ortoo distracted byscandal—such asthe Washington Post’sreport, on June 14th,Take criminal justice. Lastmonth MrSessionsinstructed federal prosecutors al-mostalwaysto bringthe gravestcharges,and to secure the longestsentencestheycan. Thatisa reversal ofa directive fromBarackObama’spresidency—opposed byMrSessions—thatadvised againstseekingharsh penaltiesforpettyoﬀences.

He oﬀered no commentonMrTrump’sawkward admission thatMrComeywasﬁred because of“thisRussiathing”.

MrComeyhashinted atfur-ther, opaque reasonsforthe move: “Thereare none,” MrSessionsaverred. The ideathathe colluded with the Kremlin was an“appallingand detestable lie”.

The average waitfora hearinginMemphis, saysTRAC, is628 days: astro-nomical, butlowerthan the 1,820 daysinChicago. MrSessions, moreover, helps tosetan oﬃcial tone which, in Memphis—home to perhaps30,000 undocumentedimmigrants—ispetrifying. CaseyBryant,legal directorofLatino Memphis, a social-servicesorganisation, tellsofa client hitbyacarwho wastoo nervousto make a fuss.Some Latino women are said to be toofearful to reportdomesticabuse. Mean-while, DOJfundingforthe representationofunaccompanied immigrantminorsinthe South issetto be lost.Memphis, accordingto itsmayor, JimStrickland, isa “welcoming” city, wherepolice are “notin the businessofenforcingfederal immigration policy”. MrTrumpand MrSessionshave said theywill pun-ish thatsortofstance; howand whethertheycan isin dispute. In a diﬀerent guise,however, Memphishaswelcomed scruti-nyofitspolice. In the wake ofthe killing ofayoungblackman byan oﬃcerin 2015, itentered into a collaborative reviewwiththe DOJ.

In Baltimore theDOJtried to delaya decree bequeathed byhispredecessor, even though ithad thesupportofthe mayorand police chief. Itwentahead, butMrSessionscould ensurethatold agreementswitherand newonesare unforthcoming. That, saysMsChettiar,might“embolden police in the use offorce”.

UnderMrObama itvigorouslyupheld votingrightswhen, forinstance, state voter-IDlawsthreatened to disenfranchise some minor-itycitizens.

Al-ready, on hiswatch, the DOJhasdroppeditspreviousclaim thata Texan lawwas in-tentionallydiscriminatory(the courtfound thatitwasanyway). Then there aregayand transgenderrights, ofwhich hehasneverbeen an advocate.

Itwould soon be followed,he promised, byfurtherbooststo the Pen-tagon’sfunding. “We’re goingto have theﬁnestequipmentofall types—whether it’saeroplanes, orshipsorequipmentin gen-eral—thatwe’ve everhad in the history ofourcountry,” he said. MrTrump hasprom-ised to expand the navyfrom 275 shipsto350, the armyfrom 476,000 active-dutysoldiersto 540,000 and to give the air forcehundredsofadditional ﬁghterjets.AsJim Mattis, the defence secretary,and General Joseph Dunford, chairman ofthe jointchiefsofstaﬀ, wentin to ﬁghtfornextyear’sdefence budgetbefore a clutchofcongressional committees, a diﬀerentpicture emerged.

Abouthalfthe extra $19bn would thusbe ab-sorbed bythe extra personnel costsandthe higheroperational and maintenancecoststhatare the consequence ofa largerforce. In termsofequipment, itwill meanone more destroyerordered, butnota sin-gle extra aircraftabove the Obama request.MrMattisadmitted to the House ArmedServicesCommittee on June 12th thatthebudgetsubmitted would notgo farbeyond“ﬁllingin holes”.

The alarm overpainkillers andheroin isjustiﬁed, butithasovershad-owed anotherworseningdrugproblem:methamphetamine. Bryan Lockerby, who headsMon-tana’sDivision ofCriminal Investigation,sayshe hasneverseen the state moreawash with meth. Infantsare beingbornhooked on it, and the parentsofnearly athird ofchildren in Montana’sfoster-caresystem are methamphetamine users.Between 2009 and 2015, drug-relatedarrestsin the state increased by62%. Thisproblem isnotconﬁned to theTreasure State. Accordingto the NationalDrugThreatAssessmentfor2016, nearlyathird ofAmerican law-enforcementagenciesranked methamphetamine asthe biggestdrugthreatin theirareas. Andthe problem seemsto be growing. In 2016,43% oflaw-enforcementagenciesin thesouth-eastand 71% in the south-westlisted methamphetamine asthe biggestdrugthreatlocally, compared with 23%and 57% respectivelyin 2009. Before 2005, methamphetamine wasoften made bypickingup a fewcommon-cold medicinesfrom the pharmacyandmixingthem with otherchemicalsinsheds, kitchensand barns. To deal withthismeth plague, which ravaged ruralcommunitiesin the late 1990sand early2000s, Congresspassed a lawin 2005 torestrictmedicines, such asephedrine,which were beingused to make it. Instead ofdisappearing, however,methamphetamine production migratedsouth to Mexico, where todaychemistsproduce mammoth batchesofthe drugin professional labs. Nearlyall the methconsumed in America todayissmuggledin from Mexico, often liqueﬁed anddisguised creativelyin gastanksor re-sealed iced-tea cans. High levelsofmethamphetamineproduction in Mexico partlyexplain whythe drugisspreading: itischeaper thaneverbefore. Accordingto the DrugEn-forcementAgency(DEA), in late 2007 thedrugcost$293 perpure gram; byearly2016 itsprice perpure gram had plum-meted to $66. In the same period, purityincreased from 40% to above 90%, allow-ingusersto enjoya more potenthigh. Although deathsfrom methamphet-amine are harderto trackthan those fromheroin orcocaine, evidence suggests thattheyare increasing. The Centresfor Dis-ease Control and Prevention recorded4,298 psychostimulantdeathsin 2014—up229% from 2004, atthe heightofthepreviousmeth epidemic. Between 2010and 2014, 85-90% ofpsychostimulantdeathsmentioned methamphetamineon the death certiﬁcate. Local studies inOregon and Texasalso showdeathsfrommeth increasingsharply, largelybecauseitismore potentnow. Drugusersare farlesslikelyto over-dose on meth than on opioids, which killpeople byslowingorstoppingtheirbreathing. Butthe drug’ssurge isfright-eningforotherreasons. Meth isa stim-ulantthatincreasesenergy, libido and— ifused athigh levelsorforlongperiods—paranoia and aggression. AstudyinSydneyin 2010 suggested thatmeth userswere almosttwice aslikelyasheroinusersto have committed violentacts inthe previousyear. And, in contrast toopioid dependency, no medical treat-mentyetexistsformeth addiction.

Yetthatwasa widelyshared reaction when the ﬁrstfullmeetingofPresidentDonald Trump’scabinet, on June 12th, be-gan with an extended ﬂatterycontest. Vice-PresidentMike Pence setthe tone, conﬁdingthat servingapresident“who’skeepinghisword to the American people” is“the greatestprivilege ofmylife”. AsMrTrump clenched hisjaw,nodded and threwin an occasional “good job” ofencourage-ment, hiscabinetsecretaries—who include formergovernors, re-tired four-stargeneralsand more than one billionaire—mostly fol-lowed suit. Theyvariouslyreported thathispresidency has“thrilled” crime-ﬁghters, excited the world with its“internationalﬂair” and inspired “love” in Mississippi. “Myhatisoﬀto you!”swooned the energysecretary, RickPerry, who in 2015 called MrTrump a “canceron conservatism”. Foraslongascameraswhirred thissurge ofpraise rolled round the room like a bureau-crats’ Mexican wave, peakingwith a testimonial from ReincePriebus, the White House chiefofstaﬀ. Unabashed byspecula-tion thathe isto be sacked, MrPriebusdeclared: “We thankyouforthe opportunityand the blessingto serve youragenda.” Theverdictofa Twitter-userfrom Toronto, “Thisisactuallythe start of‘KingLear’,” wentviral, pingingaround the political internet.No secretaryquite ﬁlled the role ofCordelia, the princesswhose principled refusal to ﬂatterKingLearin the opening sceneofthattragedy(“I cannotheave/Myheartinto mymouth”) helpsto precipitate herfather’sdescentinto madnessand the play’splunge into eye-gouging, several murdersand a small war. Afewcame close, notablyJamesMattis, the defence secretary and athoughtful formerfour-starMarine general. Ratherthan fawn, MrMattisused histurn to praise troopsand to expressa core plankofhisphilosophy: thatAmerica maintainspotentarmed forces sothatitsdiplomats“alwaysnegotiate from a position ofstrength”.AsMrTrump basked in congratulations, then hailed himselfasthe most“active” and productive presidentsince Franklin D.Roosevelt, itwasunderstandable ifsome recalled Shakespeare’stragedies.

Norishe a JuliusCaesar, whosegrandeurrendershim incautiousaround ﬂatterers: just before hisassassinsstrike, Caesarsniﬀsthathe isunmoved bytheir “basespaniel fawning”.

He knewfull well thatthepowerful men and women in the room were ﬂatteringhim—andrelished theirhumiliation. He ismore bullythan tragic hero.Robes and furr’d gowns hide allShakespeare understood bullies. The tragediesare ﬁlled withdemagogues: oratorswith a geniusforstirringup divisions andstokinggrievancesto turn decentcitizensinto angry, vengeful fol-lowers. Duringthe election MrTrump called rivals“disgusting”orsaid they“choked like a dog”. Thisweekhe called the news me-dia both fake and “dirty” and said theypursue “theiragenda ofhate”. Shakespearean populists—men like the plottersin “JuliusCaesar” orthe crowd-pleasingtribunesin “Coriolanus”—also de-humanise opponents.

MsChukicheva held a sign on which she hadwritten the words“I love Russia”, andwore a T-shirtbearingthe image ofAlekseiNavalny, a Russian opposition leader.Againstherparents’ advice, she had an-swered MrNavalny’scall to attend a rallyon Russia’snational holidayagainstcor-ruption, and forhiscampaign forthe presi-dential election in 2018. “Myparentstoldme thatwe can’tchange anythingand thatthere are no prospectsforusin this coun-try,” she said. “ButI don’twantto leave Rus-sia, and I believe thatwe can changethings.” Itwasherﬁrstpolitical action ever, Russia’s anti-corruption movementDemonstration ofintentMOSCOWAleksei Navalnyshows he and hisfollowers are a serious force44EuropeThe EconomistJune17th201712and she wasnervous.Afewhoursearlier, MrNavalnyhadbeen arrested outside hisapartmentblockfororganisingan “unsanctioned” rally.Moscowauthoritieshad approved a gath-eringata diﬀerentlocation, butthen sabo-taged it, accordingto MrNavalny, by pre-ventingaudiovisual companiesfromrentinghim a stage. MrNavalnywaswor-ried thatan amateurish-lookingdemon-stration would make him lookridiculousratherthan presidential, so he directed hisfollowersto Tverskaya Streetinstead.There, the Kremlin had blocked oﬀ traf-ﬁcfora pedestrian festival celebrating“Russia’sVictoriousPast” (hence the paganidol). The streetwasoccupied with histori-cal reconstructionsofRussian military tri-umphs, from the timesofIvan the Terribleto the second world war. (The CrimeanWarof1853-56 wasthrown in too, despitethe factthatRussia had lost.) AsMrNavalny’ssupporters, manyofthem youngenough to have lived their en-tire livesunderVladimirPutin, entered thestreet, theyfound themselvessurroundedbyreconstructionistsdressed in medievalbodyarmour, 19th-centurytsaristgownsand Stalin-era militaryand secret-policeuniforms. The protesterschanted “RussiawithoutPutin!” and “We are the powerhere!” Medieval knightsran forcover, andhelmeted riotpolice moved in, jammingtheirtruncheonsinto protesters’ stomachsand pushingthem back.Assurreal asthe scene was, italso en-capsulated the currentpolitical confronta-tion in Russia. VladimirPutin’sbackwards-lookingregime, which legitimisesitself byrestoringthe symbolsofRussia’simperialpast, isbeingchallenged bya newgenera-tion ofRussianswho feel thattheirfuturehasbeen hijacked bythe corruption, hy-pocrisyand liesofthe rulingelite, whomMrNavalnycalls“thievesand scoundrels”.The symbol ofthe protestswasa rub-berduck, a reference to a documentaryvideo MrNavalnyreleased in March thataccusesDmitryMedvedev, the prime min-ister, ofcorruption. (The video depicts MrMedvedev’simmense estate, allegedly do-nated to him byan oligarch, which in-cludesa house fora petduck.) MrMedve-devdeniesthe accusations.Afewyearsago, such a video mighthave generated laughter. Now, itproducesoutrage. “We’re diﬀerentfrom ourparents’generation in thatwe have no future,” saidone ofthe youngprotesters. While he doesnotsupportMrNavalny’snationalistpoli-tics,he seeshim asthe bestavailablemeansto enactchange.

Buthisintentwasto showthatthe rulesthe Kremlin hasestablishedforthe conductofpoliticsin Russia, and itseﬀortsto exclude him from the presidentialrace, are irrelevant. Thishasechoes ofthelate 1980s, when Mikhail Gorbachev, thelastSovietpresident, tried to expel BorisYeltsin from politicsbyﬁringhim as mayorofMoscow, notrealisingthatMrYeltsinhad grown too popularto quash. MrNa-valnyhasbuilta networkofsome 120,000volunteersacrossthe country. Whether ornotthe Kremlin acknowledgesit, he is seenasan alternative to MrPutin.The protestswere held in some 170 cit-iesacrossRussia, gatheringa total of about150,000 people, accordingto organisers.(An earlierround ofprotestson March 26thdrewperhaps100,000 people in about90cities.) Abouthalfofthe protesters are agedbetween 18 and 29. “These have been thebiggestprotestssince 1991,” saysLeonidVolkov, MrNavalny’schiefofstaﬀ. Manyofthe protestersare notscared bythe ar-rests, and see them aspartofthe action.One reason forthe unrestiseconomic.Russian real incomeshave fallen by13%overthe pasttwo and a halfyears, reachingthe level of2009.

Ifsnootyoﬃcialsonce derided MrBarnier, who will lead the Euro-pean Union’stalkswith Britain overitsexit, asle crétin desAlpes,todayfewEuropeanshave anycomplaintsoverhisnavigation ofBrexit’scraggyterrain. Since hisappointmentlastJulyMr Barnierhasdutifullytrotted around Europe listeningto concerns fromgovernments, parliamentariansand businesses, while assem-blinga crackteam ofnegotiatorsin Brussels. Now, says MrBar-nier, in a conversation thisweekwith European newspapers, it istime to geton with the job. Ifonlyitwere thateasy. In March Theresa May, Britain’sprimeminister, began a two-yearBrexitnegotiation bytriggering Article50 ofthe EU treaty. The election she called afterwardswas sup-posed to consolidate herdomesticposition before the talks be-gan. Butthe inconclusive result, in which MrsMaylost hermajor-itybutwill staggeron with the help ofNorthern Irish unionists,hasthrown a pall ofuncertaintyoverBrexit. Itisall too much forsome Europeans. One recentcartoon in a Dutch newspaper por-traysEUnegotiatorslookingon with concern asMrsMayrepeat-edlybashesherselfin the head with a hammer.MrBarnier, a formerforeign minister, istoo polite to join thecircusofSchadenfreude. Buthisreticence isnotjustcourtesy, forEurope’sseriouspoliticiansknowthatthe chaosengulﬁng Brit-ain istheirproblem, too. MrsMay’svapid sloganeering—“BrexitmeansBrexit” and the restofit—grated on European earsas muchasBritish ones, butherpointofdeparture wasclearenough: a“hard” Brexitin which Britain will leave the EU’ssingle marketand itscustomsunion. Thiswasthe premise upon which the EU’s27 remaininggovernmentsdrewup MrBarnier’snegotiatingguidelinesand thatshaped theirthinkingaboutthe EU’sfuturerelationship with Britain. And like everyone else, they assumedthatMrsMaywasheaded fora stonkingwin thatwould endorsehervision forBrexit.Noweverythingisup forgrabsagain. Will some ofMrs May’scabinetcolleaguespressherto seeka “softer” form ofBrexitwithdeeperlinksto the EU? Will Britain hold a second election beforethe Brexitclockrunsdown? Can thisgravelyweakened primeministerlastthe course? MightBritain even tryto rescind itsArti-cle 50 notiﬁcation? Such questionscomplicate the EU’stwin aimsforBrexit: to ensure an orderly, contained processthat neithertipsinto chaosnorholdsup otherbusiness, and to preserve the integ-rityofitslegal order(ie, no British “cherry-picking”). Before the election MrsMayhad accepted thatthe price ofendingthe free movementofEuropeansto Britain wasan exitfrom the EU’ssingle market. Instead, Britain would seeka shal-lowertrade deal, includingelementsofsecurityand judicial co-operation butwith lessprivileged accessto Europe’smarkets.Asked ifhe isnowpreparingfora “softBrexit”, MrBarniersayscheerfullythathe remainsopen to revised oﬀers, including the“Norwayoption” (membership ofthe single marketin exchangeforfree movementand large paymentsto the EU). Buta softBrexitcould be even more complicated to negotiatethan a hard one. IfBritain decidesto oﬀerconcessions on migra-tion in exchange formarketaccess, everyinch ofthe trade-oﬀ willrequire bargaining. MrBarnierhad accepted thatthe unity he hadfostered amongthe restofthe EU’s27 governments, hisultimatepolitical masters, would be tested when the talksbegin. Itmayprove more diﬃcultto hold the line ifthe EUisconfronted with amore conciliatoryBritish proposal. IfBritain seeksa Norway-style deal via the European EconomicArea, thatclub’smembers(Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) maybe leeryofletting in aneconomyso large thatitdominatesthe group’sinterests.All ofthiswill eatup more time. MrBarniernotesthat nearlythree monthsofthe allotted two yearshave passed without a sin-gle formal meetingunderArticle 50. Thisweekhe rebuﬀed Britishattemptsto open pre-negotiation “technical talks” on thegroundsthatLondon would be unable to give itsnegotiator amandate. MrsMayinsiststhattalkswill begin soon after June19th, asscheduled. Butherpromisescarryeverlessweight. Climbing partnersNone ofthese questionsneedsto be settled immediately. TheBrexittalks, when theyatlastgetunderway, will focus ﬁrston “di-vorce” matters, such asthe rightsofEU citizensin Britain (and viceversa) and a bill coveringBritain’soutstandingﬁnancial obliga-tions. Discussionson the future relationship will begin once “suf-ﬁcientprogress” hasbeen made on the ﬁrstsetofissues; MrBar-niersayshe hopesthatwill happen bythe startof2018.Itisimpossible to predictwhatform British politics will takebythen. Yeteven iftensionsovermigration can be eased, Euro-pean concernsaboutBritain’signorance ofwhatBrexitentailswill remain. Close integration with the single marketrequires ac-ceptingitsrulesand the jurisdiction ofEuropean courts; hardly“takingbackcontrol”. Those in Britain nowadvocatinga softerBrexitmayhave had theirhand strengthened byMrsMay’shu-miliation. Buttheywill still have to overcome those for whomsuch a Brexitresemblesno Brexitatall. And the clock will contin-ue to tickwhile theirdisputesplayout.ThisweekGermanyand France both said thatEurope’sdoorremainsopen should Britain change itsmind on leavingthe EU.Buta “Breversal” isstill unlikely; Britain’sParliamentaswell as itselectorate have voted to quit. Ifa softerexitlookspossible, Euro-peansshould setaside theirirritation with Britain and helpachieve it, ifonlyforthe sake oftheirown citizensand ﬁrms. Ne-gotiations, though, will require goodwill, time and creative think-ing, none ofwhich hasbeen much in evidence since the Britishvote.

Whatwentwrong?The biggestunknown ahead ofthe elec-tion wasturnout. Labourwaswildlypopu-laramongthe young, butpollingﬁrms dif-fered in theirestimatesofhowmanyyoungpeople would vote atall. In theevent, Labour’syoungfansexcelled them-selves: turnoutamongpeople aged 18-24was57%, accordingto a large post-electionsurveybyYouGov, a pollster. Thatis 14 per-centage pointsgreaterthan in 2015.Age isnowthe main determiningfactoraﬀectingpartychoice. The “phenomenal”generational divide hasneverbefore beenso stark, accordingto John Curtice of Nat-Cen Social Research. MrCorbyn pulled inyoungpeople in drovesbypromisingfreeuniversitytuition.

In 2015 the UK Independence Partywon 12.6% ofthe vote with an anti-EU mes-sage. With the referendum won, itsvotecollapsed. About60% ofthose who votedforUKIP in 2015 defected to the Conserva-tives, accordingto a post-election surveybyLord Ashcroft.

Itgained 18 seatsin lukewarm Leave constit-uenciesand 13 in areasthatvoted Remain. All told, ofthe 28 seatsthe Torieslost toLabour, perhaps17 can be explained bysome combination ofhigherturnout, largepopulationsofyoungand educated vot-ers, and opposition to a hard Brexit. Thatleaves11seatsdotted around Englandwhere those elementswere notsuﬃcientto explain the result.

Jonathan Powell,aBritish negotiatorofthe Good FridayAgreement, warned in a Financial Timesarticle: “Itissupposed to be the British andIrish governmentswho chairthese talks asneutral parties, butMrsMay’sgovernmentcan hardlypretend to be neutral.”The devolved Stormontassemblyhasbeen in cold storage since January, whenrelationsbetween the DUP and Sinn Fein,the main nationalistparty, broke down.The DUP maynowfocuson itsrelationshipwith the Tories, ratherthan contemplatingthe compromisesnecessaryfora devolu-tion breakthrough. The party’spsychologyhaschanged: itwill nowbe primarily inthe businessofextractingconcessionsfrom Westminster.There isno sign ofa return to wide-spread violence. Butthe atmosphere inNorthern Ireland hassoured. All butoneofitsMPsare nowhardliners. The fragilemiddle-ground tooka batteringin the elec-tion, with two moderate partieslosing allﬁve oftheirseats, an unmistakable indica-tion thatpolarisation isbecomingdeeper.MrsMay’sdeal with one side in thissensi-tive, volatile conﬂictisa gamble. 7ALTHOUGH little debated duringthecampaign, Brexitisthe government’sbiggestchallenge. Formal talksbegin nextweekdespite post-election chaos. TheBrexitdepartmentin London hasjustlosttwo ofitsfourministers. NobodyknowshowlongTheresa Maywill be in DowningStreet. Yetthe EU’stimetable isoblivious toelections. MrsMay’sletterinvokingArticle50 wassent11weeksago, and a negotiatingmandate hasbeen given bythe other27countriesto Michel Barnieratthe Euro-pean Commission. There isno doubtoverwhen Britain isdue to leave: two yearsafterMrsMay’sletter, on March 29th 2019.Yetneitherside can pretend nothinghaschanged. MrsMaycalled the electionto win a mandate forher“hard Brexit”, pri-oritisingimmigration control and escapingthe European CourtofJustice (ECJ) overthe economy. Thatimplied leavingthe EU’ssingle marketand customsunion. Buttheelection gave herno mandate. Some 82% ofvotersbacked partiespromisingto quit thesingle market. YetLabour’scommitmentwasopaque, since ittalked ofretaining allthe market’sbeneﬁts. And a majorityofMPsin both partieswere Remainers.Politicsreﬂectsthe newcircumstances.The appointmentofDamian Green, astrongpro-EUﬁgure, asﬁrstsecretary ofstate isone sign, albeitpartlyoﬀset bythechoice ofSteve Baker, a hard Brexiteer, asaBrexitminister. The prominence ofRuthDavidson, leaderofthe Scottish Tories,who wantsan “open Brexit”, isanother.MrsMay’sNorthern Irish partners, theDemocraticUnionists, fretovera possiblehard borderwith the Irish Republic. Andherpolitical weaknesshasforced Mrs Mayto retain the doveish Philip Hammond in amuch strongerposition atthe Treasury. Hehasdeclared thatvotersdid notback Brexitto make themselvespoorer. Some RemainerswantMrsMaytoswitch to the softeroption ofstaying in thesingle marketand customsunion. Afewwantto withdrawthe Article 50 letterorextend itsdeadline. Butan abruptchangeofpolicyisunlikely. ManyRemainers alsofavourthe idea oftougherimmigrationcontrols, although the single marketpre-cludesthem. Mostvotersnowjustwant togeton with Brexit. Extendingthe deadlinerequiresunanimoussupportfrom the 27,which isunlikelyto be forthcoming. Yetitispossible to drawthree broadconclusionsaboutwhere nextforBrexit.One isthatMrsMay’sprioritieswill haveto change to putthe economyand jobsﬁrst. Thatmeanslisteningto British busi-ness. Anewreportfrom the Harvard Ken-nedySchool (“MakingBrexitworkforBrit-ish Business”), based on manyinterviews,stressesthe case forbarrier-free access tothe single market, more talented immi-grantsand continuingengagementwithEUregulatoryagencies. Thissuggests itwould be wise to keep open both the sin-gle-marketand customs-union options.Asecond isthatthe vastquantity ofBrexit-related legislation, described recent-lybyLord Judge asa tsunami, will be farharderto processin a hungparliament.And thatpointsto a need forcross-partycollaboration. Even David Cameron, MrsMay’spredecessor, hascalled forthis. Itmaybe trickyformallyto involve otherpartiesin the Brexitnegotiations, not leastbecause theyhave little reason to help MrsMay. Butcompromiseswill be necessary togetthe GreatRepeal Bill and otherlawsthrough both parliamentaryhouses.The third isthatfarmore time is neededthan isavailable. MrsMaywill nowsurelyhave to acceptthe EU’ssequencingplan,which meansdealingwith the Article 50divorce before discussingnewtrade ar-rangements. Thatmakesa case formoregenerosityfrom the British side, particular-lyoverEUcitizensin Britain and the sumsneeded to paythe “Brexitbill”. Buteventhen, negotiationson a deep and specialtrade partnership will take a lotlongerthan the yearorso likelyto be left beforethe Article 50 deadline. To avoid a cliﬀ-edge exitof“no deal” thusrequiresa transi-tion. And the onlyplausible transition onoﬀerwill be to keep the statusquo, whichimpliescontinuingfree movementofpeo-ple, budgetpaymentsand the ECJ.The end-pointforBrexitisfarless cer-tain, though some claritymaybe neededbefore enteringanytransition. Itcould stillbe MrsMay’shard Brexit, with a relation-ship analogousto the EU’splanned dealswith Canada orUkraine. Butitmightequallybe a softerBrexitinto a relation-ship more like Norway’sorSwitzerland’s,which could mean retention ofeitherorboth the single marketand customsunion.There issurelyscope forsome creative ad-ditionsto these. On migration, forinstance,Britain mightsecure an emergencybrake(asNorwayhas) orpermission to oﬀer jobsﬁrstto British nationals. Subjection to theECJcould be partlydisguised bydeft use ofthe EFTAcourt, like Switzerland.The economicoutlookmatters: henceMrHammond’snewclout. Growth hasslowed in Britain butpicked up in the restofthe EU. Notonlywill thatmake votersmore aware ofthe potential costsofBrexit,butalso itwill mean thatnetEUmigrationcontinuesto fall sharply. In a year’stime,there could justbe a betterchance of com-promisesthatsuitall sides. 7Brexit after the electionCompromisesaheadThe Brexitprocess will move forward,butin a contextthathas changed utterly50BritainThe EconomistJune17th2017THE mostinﬂuential businessidea ofrecentyearsisClaytonChristensen’stheoryofdisruptive innovation.

Buthe spotted the biggest un-derserved marketin British politics—the young—and provided itwith whatitwanted: the promise ofa newkind ofpolitics. Youngish people, particularly18- to 30-year-oldsbutalsothose in their30s, have been abysmallytreated bythe British es-tablishment.

Butheoﬀered hope and enthusiasm aswell asmoney. He reintroducedphrasesthathad been banned duringthe long, technocratic yearsofNewLabour, such as“social justice”. He talked aboutpromot-inguniversal peace ratherthan nucleardeterrents. He evenlooked diﬀerentfrom traditional politicians. TonyBlair forced histroopsto dressin suitsto impressmiddle England. MrCorbynsportsa beard and looksunhappyin a tie.Labour’sleaderproduced a newbusinessmodel to cater forunderserved audiences.

MrCorbyn advanced a partic-ipatorymodel in which MPsplayed second ﬁddle to LabourPartymembersand theirvanguard ofactivistsin groupssuch as Mo-mentum. He will use hisnewfound powerto push thisrevolu-tion further: atthe LabourPartyconference in September, forex-ample, he will tryto reduce the percentage ofMPsand MEPsrequired to nominate a candidate forleaderfrom 15% to 5%.Underthe old businessmodel the LabourPartydid every-thingitcould to avoid the “taxand spend” label. MrCorbyn ar-gued thatthe countrywassickofausterityand inequality. Hismanifesto promised to nationalise industries, empowertradeunionsand boostpublicspending.

Oldpolitical allegiancesare weakeningandpublicopinion isbecomingmore ﬁckle.Conﬁdence in pollinghasbeen shaken.Pollstersare scramblingto regain it.One ofthe problemstheyface isbe-yond them to ﬁx: electoral systemsthatconfound sharesofthe total vote. Mrs Clin-ton defeated MrTrump in the popularvoteby2.1percentage points—within one pointofthe average pollingprediction—but lostbecause ofthe rulesofthe electoral col-lege. Britain’sﬁrst-past-the-postsystem reg-ularlyproducesparliamentsthatonly hazi-lyreﬂectnational vote shares; in 2015 thenativistUK Independence Partygot12.6%ofthe vote, butjustone of650 seats.Though pollstersurge caution in translat-ingvote sharesinto ﬁnal results, that warn-ingoften goesignored. In such systems, knife-edge local con-testscan be decisive. Just77,747 extra votesdistributed suitablyacrossMichigan, Wis-consin and Pennsylvania would have net-ted MrsClinton 46 more electoral-collegevotes, enough to take the White House. Atotal ofjust75 British votersswitchingtothe Conservatives, in the seatswhere theylostbythe narrowestmargins, could havegiven MrsMaya workingmajority. Britishpollsterswould still have gotthe vote sharebadlywrong. Buttheywould have come inforlesscriticism, since theircentral predic-tion would have fallen on the rightside.Like servantsand goalies, pollstersare no-ticed onlywhen theyfail. Asforthe Brexitreferendum, more pollshad putLeave than Remain ahead. “Themessage ofthe pollswas, it’sverymuch atoss-up,” saysJohn Curtice ofStrathclydeUniversity. Butthatgotlostasthe two bigpartiescampaigned forRemain, and news-papercolumnistssimplycould notbelievethatso manyBritish voterswould reallyplump forthe upheaval ofleavingthe EU.The widespread impression thatpollsare bunkmayalso have been partlydue tothe much-publicised bettingoddsoﬀeredonline. Earlierthiscentury, online bettingexchangesbeatpollstersbefore several bigelections. Economistsargued thatthe fore-castsmade bypunterswith moneyon theline were likelyto be more considered thanthe sometimesoﬀhand responsesgiven topollsters. Butthe bettingmarketshaveﬂunked theirrecenttests. BettorsfavouredaRemain victory, a Clinton presidency andaConservative parliamentarymajority,with closingoddsofmore than 80%.Lastweek’selection in Britain weak-ened the evidence forthe theorythat cam-paignshave little eﬀecton votingbehav-iour, advanced bymanypolitical scientists.MrsMay’ssupportseemsto have plungedduringherdismal campaign: Survation,the pollsterthatmostaccuratelypredictedthe ﬁnal resulton the eve ofthe election,and YouGovboth gave herpartydouble-digitleadsjustthree weeksbefore electionday. Pickingup such rapid changesin pub-licsentimentisstraightforward, thoughnotcheap: itrequireslargersample sizesand more frequentsurveys. These alsohelp with the “noise” found in anyrandomsample, which pollstersreferto assam-plingerror. Farmore intractable isthe biasthatcreepsin when samplesare notrepresen-tative ofthe electorate. Takingbigger sam-plesdoesnothelp. The marginsoferrorcited bypollstersreferto the caution ap-propriate to samplingerror, notto this ﬂaw,which isrevealed onlyon pollingday.Astrikingexample came in 1936, whenLiteraryDigest, a weeklyAmerican maga-zine, asked itsaﬄuentreaderswhom theywould vote forin thatyear’spresidentialelection. Nearly2m replied. Butthe sam-ple, though large, washorriblybiased.Based on it, LiteraryDigestforecasta land-slide forAlfLandon. He wenton to lose allbuttwo statesto Franklin Roosevelt. Poll anotherdayWhen MrsMayannounced thisyear’ssnap election, British pollstershad not yetgottheirhousesfullyin orderafter theirfailure in 2015. An inquirybythe BritishPollingCouncil, an industrygroup,blamed unrepresentative samples: Britishpollshave longtended to overstate sup-portforLabourand understate support forthe Conservatives(see chart2). Faced with an election much soonerthan theyhad expected, theymade rushedtweaksin the hope ofcorrectingthis bias.Thatled to a wide variation in their predic-tions. On the eve ofthe election theypegged the Conservative lead asanywherebetween one pointand 13. One pollster,whose ﬁrm predicted a double-digitlead,saysthathis“golden rule” wasto adoptanyplausible adjustmentthatwould takeapointortwo oﬀLabourand reallocatethatshare to the Conservatives.Such adjustmentsseem to have con-tributed to the latestmiss. Preliminary esti-matesbyWill Jenningsand PatrickSturgisofSouthampton Universitysuggestthatﬁxesintended to accountforvariable turn-out—in previouselections, declared La-boursupportershave been lesslikely thanothersto end up castinga vote—increasedthe average estimate ofthe Conservativevote share byﬁve percentage points. Sur-vation creditsitssuccessto sticking closerto the rawnumbers. “It’sthe ultimateGreektragedy, isn’tit?” saysMichael TurnerofBMG Research, the pollsterthatdidworst. “Whatyoudo to correctthe errorendsup causingit.” Internet-pollingcompaniestryto side-step samplingbiasbyrecruitinglarge, sta-ble “panels” made up ofthe rightnumbersofthe educated, the youngand so on, fromwhich theypickrepresentative sampleseach time theyrun a poll. Butthiscan stillproduce poorresults. Afterﬁndingthat itsinternetpollingin 2015 oversampled politi-callyengaged voters, who tend to be left-ish, YouGovtried hard to recruitless-en-gaged votersto itspanel.Fortelephone and face-to-face pollsters,who tryto avoid biasbychoosingrandom-lyfrom a listoftelephone numbersor ad-dresses, anotherproblem looms. Acrossthe rich world, theyare strugglingto ﬁndanyone willingto talkto them. In 1980, 72%ofAmericansresponded to a phone callseekingtheiropinion. Thatshare hadplummeted to 8% by2012, and haskeptfall-ing. Lastyear, lessthan 1% ofcallsreceivedareply. Essential governmentstatistics,such asﬁgureson consumerconﬁdence,unemploymentand household income,are also beingundermined byfadingwill-ingnessto respond to oﬃcial surveys.Pollsterswould notworryso much ifeveryone were equallyunlikelyto re-spond. Butsome typesofpeople are morereluctantthan others. Pollstersrefer to thisvariation asnon-response bias.

Lowresponse ratescontrib-uted to the failuresofpredictionsin indi-vidual statesbefore lastyear’spresidentialelection. “The biggestmisses…were inplaceswith low-educated voters,” saysMrLackey. “And those were also the placesthathad the lowestresponse rates.”Weight, weight, don’ttell meTo deal with non-response bias, pollsterstryto correcttheirsamplesbya processknown asweighting. The idea issimple: ifone group islikelierto respond to a surveythan another, givinga lowerweightto theﬁrstgroup’sanswersoughtto setmattersright. The procedure iswell-establishedand respectable: all pollstersweight theirsamplesto correctforthe diﬀerences in re-sponse ratesbetween large demographicgroups, and usuallybysimilaramounts toeach other.Butadjustingweightsisalso one ofthewayspollsterscan do whatpolitical scien-tistscall “herding”. Ifone weightingscheme producesa seeminglyoutlandishresult, the temptation isto tweakit.“There’san enormouspressure forconfor-mity,” saysAnn Selzer, an American poll-ster. Pollscan thusnarrowaround a falseconsensus, creatingunwarranted certaintyaboutthe eventual outcome. The British PollingCouncil tries to dis-courage herdingbyrequiringitsmembersto publicise anychangestheymake to theirmethodologies. Before the mostrecentelection, British pollsterslargelymanagedto resistthe temptation—though YouGov’sﬁnal prediction, which relied on diﬀerentmethodsfrom those used forthe one in theTimes, putthe Conservatives’ lead atsevenpoints, close to the average forother poll-sters. And seven ofthe eightpollsters whopredicted the outcome ofthe Brexitrefer-endum adjusted theirmethodslate in thecampaign. All ofthose revisionsfavouredRemain byatleastone percentage point. To make weightingwork, pollsters mustpull oﬀtwo diﬃculttricks. The ﬁrst isto di-vide theirsamplesinto appropriate sub-groups. Age, sex, ethnicity, social class andpartyaﬃliation are perennial favourites.The second isto choose appropriateweightsforeach group. Thisisusuallydone with the help ofa previouselection’sexitpoll, orthe mostrecentcensus. Butthe old political dividinglines arebeingreplaced bynewones. Increasingly,samplesmustbe weighted to match thevotingpopulation fora much largerset ofcharacteristicsthan waspreviouslyneed-ed. Levelsofeducation, household incomeand vaguermeasuressuch aspeople’sfeel-ingsofconnection to theircommunitieshave all started to be salient. Before theBrexitvote, both the Conservativesand La-boursupported remainingin the EU, buttheirsupporterssplit. Well-educated peo-ple voted heavilyforRemain. Those withauthoritarian leaningssplitforLeave by66%, accordingto an analysisbyNatCen, asocial-research organisation. Age, always afactorin votingbehaviour, isbecomingmore important. YoungBritonsseem tohave plumped forLabourbyan over-whelming40-pointmargin lastweek,while the oldestwere even keenerthanusual on the Conservatives. The latestdividingline isdisaﬀection.Unusuallyhigh turnoutbywhite Ameri-canslivingin rural areas, mostofwhomhave lowlevelsofeducation and a longhistoryofpolitical disengagement, helpedpropel MrTrump to hisnarrowvictory.Voterswith poorerhealth and lowersocialcohesion, asmeasured bylowexpressedwillingnessto co-operate with others, alsofavoured MrTrump. ManyBritonswho didnotbotherto vote in 2015 turned outfortheEU referendum; theyfavoured Leave by a20-pointmargin. Even when pollstersdo breaktheirsamplesinto appropriate groups, voters’changingbehaviourcan still trip them up.MostBritish pollsters, forexample, as-signed lowerweightsto youngpeople’sre-sponsesto reﬂecttheirhabituallylow turn-out: just43% ofunder-24svoted in thepreviousgeneral election, compared with66% acrossall age groups. Butthose thatmostheavilydiscounted the youngpor-tion oftheirsamplesdid worstin their pre-dictionsthistime round, suggestingthatthe youth vote rose. The pastisalso littlehelp in decidinghowto weightsamplesbefore one-oﬀvoteslike the referendumsin Britain, Italyand Colombia lastyear.Spottingnewelectoral riftsand chang-ingelectoral habitswill require much moredata (and data science) than pollsters nowuse. And pickingup changingsocial atti-tudesmeansmeasuringthem, too—whichwill take never-endingchecksand adjust-ments, since those measurementswill suf-ferfrom the same problemsaspre-electionpolls. Pollsterswill also have to improvetheirhandlingofdiﬀerential turnout andundecided voters. Mostacceptself-report-ed intention to vote, which turnsout to beapoorguide. And theyoften assume thatundecided voterswill eitherstayaway oreventuallysplitthe same wayaseveryoneelse, which seemsnotto have been thecase in recentcontests.And dealingwith decliningresponserateswill probablyrequire newwaystocontactprospective voters. Duringthe ear-lydaysofinternetpolling, manyfearedthatonline sampleswere bound to be un-representative, mainlybecause theywould include too fewolderpeople. ButBritain’sonline pollsterssilenced their crit-icsin the Brexitvote, where theycame twopercentage pointscloserthan telephonepollstersto the result. Some startups arenowtestingwhattheycall “programmaticsampling”: advertisingveryshortsurveysto smartphone users. Google, which runsbespoke marketsurveysforcompanies,triesto ensure representative samples byusingbrowsinghistoryto guessrespon-dents’ demographics.Finally, pollsterswill have to becomemore statisticallysophisticated. Sampling1,000-2,000 people and massagingtheirresponsesto correctforpasterrorslooks in-creasinglyantiquated. YouGov’srecentsuccesswasbased on rollingquestion-nairesadministered dailyto 7,000 peoplefrom a 50,000-strongonline panel, withthe resultscombined usingadvanced num-ber-crunchingknown as“multilevel re-gression and post-stratiﬁcation”. WhitherforecastingPerhapspollsters’ strongestdefence isthatno one else doesbetter. In 2012 PeggyNoo-nan, an American columnist, contendedthatMittRomneywould defeatMrObamabecause she had seen more Romneyyardsigns. Othercommentatorshave basedelection predictionson nothingmore thanattendance atralliesorthe volume of parti-san postson social media.Ifsuch guessworkwasall there was togo on, manymore election resultswouldbe shocks. Theywould routinelycausemarketturmoil. From one vote to another,politicianswould have no wayto gaugethe publicmood. Turnoutwould suﬀer: arecentstudyofSwissreferendumsfoundthatitrose in close votes, butonly whenthere were pre-vote polls. Pollsterssome-timesdeserve a kicking. Butwithoutthem,democracieswould fare worse. 7Not what he was expecting54The EconomistJune17th2017For daily coverage of business, visitEconomist.com/business-ﬁnance 1ITISremarkable whata diﬀerence a singleelection can make. “The wayEurope isre-garded bythe restofthe world haschanged in a fewmonths,” saysGérardMestrallet, chairman ofboth EngieandSUEZ, two bigFrench energyﬁrms, and aboard memberatSiemensofGermany, theregion’sbiggestengineeringﬁrm. The ar-rival ofEmmanuel Macron asFrance’sre-form-minded newpresident—hispartyissetfora giantvictoryin parliamentaryelectionsthisweek—ishelpingto trans-form attitudesfrom gloom to cheer.MrMestralletechoesmanycorporateleadersin describing“real hope and enthu-siasm”, amid expectationsthatthe newpresidentwill, within months, “de-block”the euro zone’ssecond-largesteconomy.MrMacron will startfreeingbusiness activ-ities, he says, ﬁrstwith legislative reform ofarigid labourmarketto simplifyrules onhiringand ﬁring, and then bycutting taxrates(the corporate kind will fall from34.4% to 25%). Measuresto boostentrepre-neurship and youngtechnologyﬁrmsarealso expected. Thismayall sound over-op-timistic, butMrMestralletmerelycapturesan ebullientmood thatisspreadingacrossEurope.In truth, businesssentimentin Franceand elsewhere wastickingup before MrMacron’ssuccess.

Thatisan uncommonlypugna-ciousstatementfora ﬁrm thatoperates be-hind the scenesand usespublicpressure asalastresort. Unlike itslouderAmericanpeers, such asBill Ackman’sPershingSquare, Paul Singer’sElliottManagementorDan Loeb’sThird Point, Cevian has nev-erwritten a pointed open letterto a chiefexecutive orwaged a proxybattle (al-though Carl Icahn, an activistwho hasbeen known to call bosses“morons”, isone ofitsinvestors).Itscalm approach seemsto suitcor-porate Europe. Cevian isthe region’slarg-estactivistfund, and one ofthe world’sbiggest, with over$15.4bn in assets. Itwasfounded byMrGardell and LarsForberginStockholm in 2002; both still run it. Its“constructive” activism, focusingon only adozen companiesata time, goesbacktothe founders’ time aschiefexecutive andchiefinvestmentoﬃcerofCustos, a listedinvestmentﬁrm, in the mid-1990s. Although European corporate gover-nance isoften compared unfavourablywith America’s, MrGardell saysithasmanyadvantages. American managementlargelycontrolsthe processfornominatingnewboard members, so an activistfundmayneed to wage a loud campaign just togeta seatatthe table. In the countrieswhere Cevian operates, itstypical owner-ship stake of5-20% isenough to easily, oreven automatically, geta board seat. Thatsaid, itoperatesmainlyin the Nordic coun-tries, Britain, Germanyand Switzerland,regardinggovernance in the wildsofsouthern Europe astoo unpredictable.

Anbanghad shot toprominence justweeksbefore with a dealworth $2bn to acquire the WaldorfAstoriahotel in NewYorkfrom America’sHilton.Since then MrWuhasattempted acqui-sitionsaround the world worth a total ofsome $38bn (see table). Political controver-sieshave caused a numberto unravel. Onethatrecentlyfell apartwasAnbang’snego-tiation to take a $400m stake in a propertyin Manhattan, 666 5th Avenue, controlledbya ﬁrm owned bythe familyofJaredKushner, PresidentDonald Trump’sson-in-law. There were complaintsabouta poten-tial conﬂictofintereston the part ofMrKushner, who advisesMrTrump on rela-tionswith China. Domesticpoliticsin China isnow a farmore pressingconcern. Formonthsru-mourshave circulated thatPresidentXiJinping’santi-corruption campaignershadMrWuin theirsights. On June 13th Caijing,aprominentbusinessmagazine, publishedastorystatingthaton June 9th the authori-tieshad detained MrWu. Anbangcon-ﬁrmed on June 13th that“forpersonal rea-sons” MrWuwas“temporarilyunavailable”, butitrefused to comment onhiswhereabouts. The article disappearedquicklyfrom Caijing’swebsite, althoughpressaccountssuggesthe isstill missing. WhymightMrWube in trouble? De-spite hisbrash dealmaking, he wasoncethoughtuntouchable because he marriedagranddaughterofDengXiaoping. His ap-parentdisappearance could be tied to anongoingcorruption purge ofCommunistPartyoﬃcials. He maypossiblybe linkedto an investigation into XiangJunbo, Chi-na’schiefinsurance regulator, a probe thatwasannounced in April. MrXianghad un-leashed a burstofderegulation thatal-lowed ﬁrmssuch asAnbangto take on farmore risk, though allegationsagainst himmaynotinvolve the insurance industry.AnotherpossibilityisthatMrWuﬂoutedregulationsfortoo long. Anbang’sriskypractices, includingusingshort-term in-strumentsto fund long-term investments,eventuallyprompted the regulatorto act.Lastmonth itbanned Anbangfrom issuingnewproductsforthree months.Numerouscorporate bosseshave beendetained in the pastthree years, often formysteriousreasons, butmosthave been re-leased. Atthe end of2015, forinstance, GuoGuangchang, the bossofShanghai’sFosunconglomerate, disappeared butlaterre-emerged from detention. Butthe ﬁrm’sdealmakingmustsurelybe on hold, even ifMrWuisreleased.

Thisno-frillsapproach bothpermitsultra-lowpricesand earnscashquickly, which isthen reinvested in newstoresand oﬀerings, luringmore custom-ers. Both privately-owned discountershave carved outsizeable nichesin practi-callyeverycountryin which theyoperate.Lidl started in 1973; itrakesin a tenth of allgroceryspendingin Germanyand 5% inBritain (where itlaunched in 1994). Aldi be-gan in 1961and hasenjoyed similarsuccessathome and abroad. Lidl promisesthatpricesatitsnewAmerican storeswill be up to 50% lowerthan those ofcomparable productsatoth-ergrocers(Aldi excluded). Itwill certainlyrequire steep discountsforitto make amark. The American groceriesmarkethasnotbeen kind to foreign interlopers. Otherworld-classEuropean chains, such asCar-refourfrom France and Tesco from Britain,have tried and failed to geta foothold.Aldi’srecord isunusual. Norhave private-label goodstaken upmuch space on the shelvesofconventionalAmerican grocers. Theyaccountforonly18% ofgrocerysales, lessthan halfthe aver-age penetration ata western Europeangrocer. Thisispartlybecause the stigmathatprivate-label productsare “onlyforpoorpeople” ismore ﬁrmlyentrenched inAmerica than in Europe, notesSimonJohnstone ofKantarRetail, a consultancy. Lidl haslongeyed expansion intoAmerica, butplansare said to have beenrepeatedlyshelved, perhapsowingto pastinternal disputes. Itsbungled attempt tolaunch in Norwaya fewyearsbackalso leftmanagementcautious. Itmustnowreckonwith Aldi. LizRuggles, head ofmarketing atAldi’sAmerican division, saysthatnew re-tailers“can’tmatch ourrelationshipswithhundredsofAmerica-based suppliers.”Nevertheless, mostonlookersexpectLidl’sentrance to roil the American groceryindustry, posingyetanotherdangertocompaniesalreadythreatened byinvest-mentsfrom Walmart, online startupsandAmazon. Marketshare isoften on oﬀer atthe lowand premium endsofgrocery. InBritain three ofthe fastest-growinggrocersbymarketshare in 2016 were Lidl, Aldi andWaitrose, an upmarketchain. In America,too, salesatconventional grocerssuch asKrogerare stagnant. Bain expectsdeep dis-countersto growby8-10% each yearbe-tween nowand 2020, ﬁve timesasfast astraditional grocers.

When the crisisstruck itsfundingdried up and itsproﬁtscollapsed.MrImmeltdeservesplauditsforshuttingmostofitdown in 2015, butbythen thedamage wasdone.The second ﬂawislesswidelyunder-stood butjustasimportant: the perfor-mance ofthe non-ﬁnancial businesshasbeen lacklustre.

Butthe probesintoalleged briberyand corruption launchedbyAmerican and Swisslaw-enforcementoﬃcialshave nothelped.

Theyclaimed thattheirdismissal,with hundredsofinvestigationsin pro-gress, would mean the “de facto end tothe reform eﬀorts”. Gianni Infantino,FIFA’snewboss, described itasa “stormin a teacup”. Thatmessage, like FIFA’sbroadcastrights, mayprove a tough sell. ZURICHAyearbefore the World Cup in Russia, FIFAis shunned bysponsors “IFTHEYacceptthattheystole from usand seekforgivenessin frontofGodand the angelsand all Tanzaniansand en-terinto negotiations, we are readyto dobusiness.” Asconciliatorygesturesgo, thatone byJohn Magufuli, Tanzania’spresi-dent, to Acacia Mining, the country’slarg-estforeign investor, could hardlyhavebeen more fork-tongued.Nonetheless, two dayslaterJohnThornton, head ofBarrickGold, Acacia’slargestshareholder, metMrMagufuli tostarttalkson endinga dispute thathashalved Acacia’smarketvalue since the gov-ernmentin March imposed a ban on theexportofgold- and copper-concentrates. Itisa markofthe seriousnessofthe stand-oﬀthathe isreadyto negotiate on all points ofcontention between the two sides. The contextofthe rowisincreasinglytypical ofAfrica’sminingindustry. TheTanzanian governmentisseekingmore taxrevenue from a foreign miningﬁrm thatwasinitiallywooed into the countrybygeneroustaxconcessions. The state alsowantsto generate more value and jobs bysmeltingAcacia’sconcentratesdomestical-ly, ratherthan abroad.Thatmayseem reasonable, butMrMa-gufuli’sﬁrebrand populism, aswell as hisunpredictability, have made ita particular-lyworryingtestcase forminingﬁrmsacrossthe region. In April Tanzania an-nounced a newpresidential committee tolookinto itsgold exports. In late May thecommittee accused Acacia ofunderreport-ingitsgold exportsbya factoroften, an ac-cusation MrMagufuli repeated. Acacia saysthe chargesoftaxevasionare absurd. Theynote thatifproductionwere asunderstated asthe committee al-leged, Bulyanhuluand Buzwagi, the twomineswhere itproducesconcentrate,would be the biggestgold producersin theworld. The ﬁrm saysthatit“wishesthiswere true, butsadlyitisnotthe case.” Itsgold production isaudited in itsaccounts.HowfarMrMagufuli wishesto go is un-clear. The bigfearisthathe mayfavour fullnationalisation. Buthe mayaccepta morepragmaticsettlement. AnalystsatUBS, abank, reckon the Tanzanian governmentwantsto bullyAcacia into givingup ashare ofits“taxassets”, which itvaluesat$532m. Forexample, the companyisowedsome $150m in VATrefunds. Barrick, which ownsalmost64% ofAcacia, will discussall ofthis. “Anegotiat-ed solution isbetterthan escalation, suchasgoingto international arbitration,” aspokesman says. Thatmeansitispreparedto talkaboutthe taxproblem aswell asthepossible construction ofTanzania’sﬁrstsmelterofgold- and copper-concentrates,even though the latterhaslongbeen con-sidered uneconomicbecause the coun-try’soutputofconcentratesistoo low.Since the ban wasimposed, Acacia hascontinued to mine, stockpilingitsoutputinstead ofexportingit. Butitcannot contin-ue withoutgeneratingcash forever. If itstopsproduction, the damage will extendto the countryatlarge. LastyearTanzania’seconomywasamongAfrica’sbestper-formers, growingbyabout6%. Itneedsmore foreign investmentto maintain thatpace.

America earned almostasmuch from exportinghydrocarbonstoMexico asfrom carsand trucks. Thisabout-turn hasbeen caused byseveral factors, namelyAmerica’sshaleboom, Mexico’sslumpingoil output(down bymore than 1m barrelsa dayin adecade) and energyliberalisation in 2014thatended Pemex’s75-year-old hegemonyoverthe domesticoil industry. Thisshiftinglandscape hasalreadyhad an eﬀecton Pe-mex: a recentbump in oil prices, combinedwith cost-cutting, hasled to itsﬁrst consec-utive quarterlyproﬁtin sixyears. The rip-ple eﬀectthrough North America’senergybusinesshasalso been quick, and shouldexpand—provided itisnotderailed by ahamﬁsted eﬀortto renegotiate NAFTA.The cross-borderﬂowofhydrocarbonsisthe mosttangible change. Petrol fromAmerican reﬁneriesamountsto abouthalfofMexico’sdomesticconsumption. Lastmonth Tesoro, a Texan reﬁner, became theﬁrstprivate ﬁrm to win an auction to moveimported petroleum productsthrough Pe-mex’sown tanksand pipelines. Mexico hasalso become the destina-tion ofchoice forsurplusAmerican naturalgas, produced in the shale revolution.

Butall were builtbefore 1980, aredecrepit, and lose about$9bn a year. The changesare becomingvisible at thepetrol pump. ExxonMobil, America’slarg-estoil company, announced in Maythat itwould open itsﬁrstpetrol station in Mexi-co thisyearand invest$300m in fuel distri-bution overthe nextdecade. Currently,onlyone petrol station in Mexico isownedbya supermajor, BP(itsenthusiasticpumpattendantsworkforsalaries, nottips, un-like those atPemex-branded ones). Ata congressional hearingin Washing-tonthismonth, expertsnoted thatthe Un-ited States, Mexico and Canada are ontrackto achieve North American energy in-dependence by2020—meaningthe regionwill produce more liquid fuelsthan it con-sumes. Cheap, abundantenergywill boostthe region’sindustrial competitiveness; itwill also reduce itsdependence on less sta-ble producerssuch asVenezuela and Per-sian GulfStates.Butin both America and Mexico, uncer-taintiesloom.

Theywere largely un-touched bythe madnesssouth ofthe borderand acrossthe pondand keptchurningoutproﬁts. Afterthe crisisexperts wenton pil-grimagesto Toronto and Ottawa to studythe Canadian way. Thecountry’scentral-bankgovernor, MarkCarney, became a ﬁnan-cial celebritywho washeadhunted to run the BankofEngland.Canada’sbanksquicklyjoined the selectranksofthe indus-try’ssuperpowers, shootingup the global league tablesin the af-termath ofthe crisis. Todaythree ofthem are on the list ofthe 20biggestbanksglobally, measured bymarketvalue: Royal BankofCanada (RBC), Scotia and Toronto Dominion (TD). RBC isworthmore than Spain’sSantander, the euro zone’sbiggestbank.Ithastaken nearlya decade butCanadian lendersare backinthe spotlight, thistime accused ofrecklessness. The country hashad two economicsupercyclesin the 21stcentury: a commoditiesboom which ended in 2015 and a housingboom which ispeakingnow. House pricesare up by76% in a decade. Overthatperiod thebig-ﬁve banks’ lendingbookshave almosttripled in size and theratio ofhousehold debt(mainlymortgages) to GDPhasaccord-inglyrisen from 74%to 101%, one ofthe highestanywhere.Rapid creditgrowth hasbeen a reliable predictorofﬁnancialcrises. The mood in Canada isjittery. In the pastyear the authori-tieshave played regional “whacka mole”, imposingleviestotamp down wild speculation in the housingmarket, ﬁrst in Van-couver, then in Toronto; Montreal maybe next. In April a smallmortgage-ﬁnance ﬁrm, Home Capital, suﬀered a run.The banks’ bosseshave two familiarlinesofdefence. First,Canada isnotAmerica. Itsmortgagesare designed more safely—aborrowerhasto repaya mortgage even iftheyditch the house, forexample. In America a ﬁfth ofmortgageswere responsible forhalfofbanks’ losses. Bankersargue thatCanada’sdebtismoreevenlyspread and thatthe cohortofpoor, over-indebted house-holdsisrelativelysmall. Culturally, Canadiansare ﬂinty, theysay:Alberta’seconomyhasbeen walloped bythe drop in the oil pricesince 2014, forexample, butdefaultsthere have barelyrisen.Asa resultregulatorsreckon thatthe worst-case scenariowon’tbe too bad. Forexample, the state mortgage-insuranceagencyassumesa worstcase ofa 2% lossrate on mortgages, wellbelowthe cumulative lossrate in America of5% in 2008-10.The bankers’ otherargumentisthateven ifCanada faced thehigh lossratesseen in America, ﬁrmscan take the pain thankstotheirhigh capital and healthyproﬁts. Schumpeterhaskicked thetyresofthe ﬁve bigbanks. Assuminga 5% lossrate on theirmort-gagesand consumerloansin 2017-20, equivalentto C$70bn($53bn), theircore-capital ratioswould stayabove 10%. In realitythe losseswould be smaller, because halfofmortgagesare in-sured, mainlybyCMHC, a state agency. Thisbodyhasthe capaci-tyto endure itsshare ofagony, usingitsC$35bn cushion ofcashreservesand earningsfrom the insurance feesitcharges lenders.An American-style disastermightstill have casualties. Asliverofthe mortgage marketisin the handsofsmall ﬁrmsthat are sub-jectto fewerrules. And some bankshave gorged more than oth-ers, probablyassumingmore risk. Forexample CIBC, the ﬁfth-largestbank, hasupped itsmortgage bookby24% since 2012, com-pared with 15% atTD. (BankofMontreal isthe fourth-biggest.) Butthere isunlikelyto be a blow-up ofthe entire system. In-stead the banksface a diﬀerentproblem. IfCanada isup to itsgillsin debt, thatmeanstheycan no longerexpand in a spectacularlyproﬁtable market. Banks’ returnson equity(ROE) in Canada are15-20%. The banks’domesticproﬁtshave doubled, to C$24bnoverthe pastdecade, and have risen from 0.6% ofGDPto 1.3%,higherthan in America (0.7%) and Britain (0.3%).Afteradjustingfordividends, the big-ﬁve bankscould nowgenerate almostC$20bn ofsurplusproﬁtseach year.

To dothatthe bankswould collectivelyneed to build the equivalent ofanotherGoldman Sachsin the nextfouryears, ora newJPMor-gan Chase in the nextdecade.

Soon after, he asked histreasurysecretary, Steven Mnuchin, to measure allAmerica’srules(notjustDodd-Frank)againstseven broad principles, includingthe prevention ofbail-outsbythe taxpayerand makingregulation more eﬃcient.On June 12th MrMnuchin gave the ﬁrstpartofhisanswer, in a 147-page reportonbanks.

Den-nisHarbath, the plantmanager, overseesoperations. He isworried aboutthe work-ers. “Theyhave mental fatigue,” he says. The source ofthe stressisa numberscrawled on a wall in white chalk. Thatisthe dollarprice ofa tonne ofaluminium,seton the London Metal Exchange (LME).The workerskeep trackofiton their smart-phones.

Afewyearsago, theyweren’tparticu-larlyaware ofthe price, saysAndyMe-serve, the local union president. Thatchanged after2015, when the price plungedto below$1,500 pertonne, promptingCen-turyto shutdown 60% ofthe plant’scapac-ityand layoﬀhundredsofworkers. Thewhole industrywasaﬀected.

ButMrHar-bath thinkssomethingﬁshyisgoingon.Why, he asks, did hisplanthave to curtailcapacitywhen itsenergycostsare lowerthan in China?The Trump administration issuspi-cious, too. On April 26th ittriggered an in-vestigation into the aluminium industry todefend itagainst“unfairtrade practicesand otherabuses”. ApublichearingonJune 22nd will give the industrythe chanceto airitsgrievances. (Asimilarinvestiga-tion into steel islooming.)There issome substance to the worries.The Chinese governmentdolesoutcheaploansto itsindustry, encouragingoverca-pacity. Itsoutputhassoared in recent years.Since China joined the World Trade Orga-nisation (WTO) in 2001, itsaluminium pro-duction hasrisen from 14% ofthe global to-tal to 54% in 2016. Itssize givesithuge inﬂuence over theglobal price, which fell in 2015 when Chi-nese demand did notkeep pace with itsgargantuan supply. Exportingovercapac-itymakesforbetterdomesticpolitics thancuttingit, given the potential forjob losses.Withoutproduction curbs, analystsatBankofAmerica Merrill Lynch predict theglobal aluminium marketcould be over-supplied by8% by2020. The Trump administration istrying toseem tough. Itsoﬃcial investigation in-vokesSection 232 ofthe Trade ExpansionActof1962, which allowsthe presidenttoimpose trade restrictionsifhe suspects im-portsare threateningnational security.When workersatthe Hawesville plantsawthe newsofMrTrump’sinvestigation, theplanthummed with excitement. Perhapsthe action would restore those lostjobs.To them, the linkbetween aluminiumand national securityseemed natural. Wil-burRoss, MrTrump’scommerce secretary,mentioned thatthere wasonlyone Ameri-can smelterleftthatmakeshigh-puritymetal ofthe sortthatthe armed forcesneed.

On the right, politi-ciansthinkthata lowercorporate-tax ratewill lead to more businessinvestmentand thusfastereconomicgrowth. Hencethe initial stockmarketenthusiasm afterPresidentDonald Trump waselected on aplatform thatincluded cutsin businesstaxes. On the left, the beliefisthat busi-nessisnotpayingits“fairshare” oftaxand thatitcan be furthersqueezed to payforspendingcommitments. Hence thepromise ofthe LabourPartyin Britain’srecentelection campaign to push the cor-porate-taxrate up to 26% (from 19%).Howdo these theoriestranslate intopractice? To ﬁnd outthe eﬀecton businessinvestment, TheEconomisttookthe cor-porate-taxratesin OECD countriesand di-vided them into quartilesfrom highest(1st) to lowest. Then we calculated theﬁve-yearaverage in each quartile for grossﬁxed capital formation asa share of GDP.Asthe top chartshows, the relation-ship isnotverystrong. The countries withthe highesttaxratesgenerate less invest-mentthan those with the lowest, butthere isnotmuch diﬀerence. Thatis prob-ablybecause the decision to invest in acountrydependson a lotmore than tax.The underlyinggrowth rate ofthe econ-omyand the regulatoryclimate also playabigpart. Independentoftheirtax rates,forexample, South Korean and Turkishcompaniesare investinga lot. Perhapstheyare catchingup with mature econo-mies, perhapstheyare over-investing.Whataboutthe taxtake? The picture iscomplicated here, too. Lowertaxratesmayjustworkbypinchingrevenuesfromothercountries. Forexample, Ireland,with a 12.5% rate, earnsa higherpropor-tion ofGDPin revenuesthan France, at34.4%. And the headline taxrate maynotbe decisive. Countrieswith high rates (likeAmerica) tend to oﬀsetthem with allow-ancesand deductionsthatbringdown theeﬀective rate thatcompaniespay. The idea ofusingtaxlevelsto boost rev-enuesdoesnotgetmuch support, either.Mostcountriessitwithin the 2-3%-of-GDPrange (see bottom chart). The countrieswith the lowestcorporate-taxratesreceiveabitlessin taxes. Butthe diﬀerence be-tween the top and bottom quartilesis only0.9% ofGDP. Grabbingthisextra chunkmightbe useful revenue, butwhen publicspendingis40% ofGDPorso, othersourcesoffundingare a lotmore important. The countrieswith the highesttax takes(over4% ofGDP) tend to be those, like Aus-tralia and Norway, with plentyofnaturalresources. Theycan take advantage of cap-tive businesses. Butthatisnotan option formostdeveloped nations, especiallygiventhe potential fortaxcompetition. OECDcountriesare tryingto co-operate to stopcompaniesfrom gamingthe internationaltaxsystem. Butitisa trickytask; oneman’staxavoidance isanotherman’sle-gitimate businessplanning. Two otherthingsare worth remem-bering. The ﬁrstisthatcompanies aremerelylegal entities. To the extent theypaymore taxes, theymustgetthe moneyto do so from elsewhere. Politicians on theleftthinkthe moneycomesfrom share-holders. Butitisnotassimple as that(andeven ifitwere, those shareholders mayrepresentthe pension fundsofcitizens).Forinstance, a large companymight notwantto reduce the proﬁtsitpaysout toshareholdersforfearofbecominga take-overtarget. So itcould move some of itsoperationsto a lower-taxregime. Or itcould recoup the lossbychargingcon-sumersmore, orbypayingworkersless.Second, countriesdo notjustwant toattractbusinessesforthe taxesthey paybutforthe workerstheyemployand forthe extra revenuestheycreate forlocalsuppliers. The eﬀective taxtake ﬁrms gen-erate (on wages, salesand property taxes)ismuch higherthan the taxon proﬁtsalone. So there are dangersin drivingbusinessaway, somethingBritain needsto contemplate afterthe Brexitvote.Some argue thatthe proﬁtstaxshouldbe abolished. Governmentsshould lookthrough the corporate structure and taxshareholdersdirectly. The problem is thatmanyshareholders, such aspensionfundsand charities, are tax-exempt, andothersare based in low-taxregimes. Thatwould also create incentivesforindivid-ualsto incorporate to cuttheirtax bills. Sosuch a move should awaitmuch moresweepingtaxreform. In the meantime,governmentswill have to make do withwhattheycurrentlyget. There isno magictrickforcollectinga lotmore.The business oftaxThe right rate?OECD countries, 2017 or latestBy quartile of corporate-tax rateSources: OECD; The EconomistAverage business investment as % of GDPAverage corporate-tax revenue as % of GDP0510151st (highest)2nd3rd4th051st2nd3rd4thButtonwoodDoes itmatterhownations pluckthe corporate goose?Economist.com/blogs/buttonwoodchain”.

In the 1990s, underthe fund’sguidance, theirgovernmentcutspending,scrapped subsidies, liberalised the ex-change rate and privatised over200 state-run ﬁrms. This“structural adjustment”waspainful: employmentshrivelled and,bythe end ofthe decade, income perper-son had shrunkby8%. In the wordsofBin-well Sinyangwe, a novelist, “theywere theyearsofmoneyﬁrstorelse no friendship”.So itwaswith some trepidation thatZambia welcomed an IMFmission, whichconcluded on June 10th. Asin the 1990s,Zambia hasbeen hitbyplummetingpricesforcopper, itsmain export. The proposedpackage, which islikelyto be ﬁnalised overthe comingmonths, could be worth $1.3bn,which would be the country’sbiggestwiththe fund in two decades. The retro feel extendsacrossAfrica,where GDPgrewlastyearby1.4%, the slow-estrate thiscentury. Ghana agreed on athree-yearIMFbail-outin 2015. Oil export-ersin central Africa are lookingfor help.IvoryCoast, the region’ssecond fastest-growingeconomy, isin a programme. Inall, 19 sub-Saharan countrieshave borrow-ingarrangementswith the IMF; manyhavebeen plagued byhigh debtsresultingfrompublic-spendingbinges.Some thingshave changed, however.“Structural adjustments?” said ChristineLagarde, the fund’sboss, in 2014. “Thatwasbefore mytime.” The talknowisofmoreﬂexible conditionsand ofcountriestakingthe lead in theirprogrammes. In Zambiasome scepticsare beingwon over: Alex-anderChikwanda, the ﬁnance ministeruntil lastSeptember, commentsthatfundstaﬀare “notastheological” asbefore.

When the BlackDeath struckEnglandin 1348, wipingouta third ofthe popula-tion, interestratesfell further, to 5%, and ap-prenticeshipsbecame much more attrac-tive. The increased supplyofskilled labourrelative to unskilled workersdrove downthe wage premium. Data from Jan Luitenvan Zanden ofUtrechtUniversityshowsimilarpatternsin Belgium, France and theNetherlands. The second bigdecline in the skilled-wage premium came afterthe IndustrialRevolution.

Tontines intheirpurestform had alreadybeen bannedin Britain underthe Life Assurance Act of1774, primarilybecause ofthe perverse in-centivesinherentin a productthatoﬀersbeneﬁtswhen othersdie. Although there isno known evidence thattontinesinspiredmurderplots, theydid encourage fraud.Moshe Milevsky, ofthe Schulich School ofBusinessin Canada, hasuncovered datathatsuggestparentsin 17th-centuryBritainwould take outa tontine, nominate a childand ifthe child died, aswasall too com-mon, simplygive anotherchild the samename so asnotto forgo theirdividend.

Asmall butincreasinglyvolu-ble group ofacademics, aswell assome as-setmanagersand actuaries, thinkthat anadapted form oftontine mightbe just theproductto provide insurance againsttheriskofoutlivingone’ssavings, an issuewith which retirementplanners, corpora-tionsand governmentsaround the worldare strugglingto cope.Poolingliveshasalwaysbeen one ofthe mostcost-eﬀective waysto cover suchlongevityrisk. “It’swhat’smissingin thecurrentDC[deﬁned-contribution pen-sions] set-ups; nothinghasreplaced the oldlongevitypool which the employerusedto form,” saysChip Castille ofBlackRock,an assetmanager. Although annuitiesoﬀeraguaranteed lifetime income, theyare rel-ativelyexpensive because theirissuersmusthold a large capital buﬀer. Retiredpeople tend notto like them astheypay alowrate. Tontinesare simple to under-stand and could be much lesscostlythanannuitiesbecause the risksare nottakenonto the balance-sheetofan insurer.Enthusiastsbelieve modern technol-ogyand data-crunchingcould help over-come the instrument’sshortcomings. Elec-tronicrecordsmake iteasierto verifywhethersomeone isdead; crowdfundingcould help source a tontine pool; and theblockchain, a type ofdecentralised ledger,could anonymise it(and thusavertanymurderplots). “The eventual disruptionwill come notfrom a traditional asset man-ager, butfrom a 22-year-old kid in SiliconValley,” predictsMrMilevsky, who hasseen the numberoftontine-related patentapplicationsincrease recently. Tontines areathingofthe past. Buttheymayyet comebackfrom the grave. 7THATcentral bankscannotendlessly re-duce unemploymentwithoutsparkinginﬂation iseconomicgospel. Itfollowsfrom “a substantial bodyoftheory, in-formed byconsiderable historical evi-dence”, accordingto JanetYellen, chair ofthe Federal Reserve. Herconviction ex-plainswhy, on June 14th, the Fed raised in-terestratesbya quarterofa percentagepoint, to a range of1-1.25%. Excludingfood and energy, prices areonly1.5% higherthan a yearago; the Fed’sinﬂation targetis2%. ButMsYellen thinksunemploymentisbelowitsso-called “nat-ural” rate, so inﬂation should soon rise. Isshe right? Orhasthe relationship betweenunemploymentand inﬂation, dubbed thePhillipscurve, gone missing?Itisnotthe ﬁrsttime the theory hasfailed. Afterthe ﬁnancial crisisunemploy-mentsoared to 10%. Thissurfeitofworkersshould have sentinﬂation tumbling. Butpricesheld up well; in October2009, whenunemploymentpeaked, underlyinginﬂa-tion was1.3%, onlya little lowerthan itis to-day. Some economistsexplained thisbysayingthatthe natural rate ofunemploy-menthad gone up in tandem—in otherwords, thatsome ofthe rise in joblessnesswaspermanent. In August2013 RobertGor-don, an economistatNorthwestern Uni-versity, putthe natural rate ofunemploy-mentatfully6.5%.Thatexplanation hasnotaged well. Un-employmentisnow4.3%, yetinﬂation re-mainslow. In response, the Fed’sestimatesofthe natural rate have fallen (see chart).Thisweektheydropped again. The con-stantcatch-up underminesthe Fed’sjustiﬁ-cation forrate rises. (Itplansanother thisyear, and also to startshrinkingits balance-sheet, which ballooned duringand afterthe recession asitboughtassetswith new-lycreated money.)Yeteconomistsare notaboutto aban-don the Phillipscurve, forthree reasons.First, the eﬀectsofunemploymenton inﬂa-tion can getlostamid temporaryeconomicgyrations. Thatismostobviouswhen oilpricesfall, astheydid in late 2014. More re-cently, the price ofmobile data hasdropped. One ﬁrm, Verizon, began oﬀeringlimitlessdata. Atthe same time, statisti-cianshave increased the weighttheygiveto such changes. Asa result, bettermobile-phone dealshave reduced consumer-priceinﬂation byover0.2 percentage pointsoverthe pastyear. EconomistsatGoldmanSachs, a bank, thinkunemploymentwould have to change byfully1-2 percent-age pointsto have a comparable impact.Second, itispossible thatinﬂation willtake oﬀsharplywhen unemploymentgetstoo low, ratherthan graduallyasthe econ-omyapproachesthe threshold. Thishap-pened duringthe period thatbestmirrorstoday’scircumstances: the late 1960s. Withunemploymentunder4%, inﬂation rosefrom 1.4% in November1965 to 3.2% a yearlater, and almost5% bythe end ofthe de-cade. PresidentLyndon Johnson waspartlyto blame. He pressed the Fed not tooﬀsettaxcutsfullywith tightermoney.With PresidentDonald Trump promisingtaxcuts, and able to replace MsYellen earlynextyear, historymayyetrepeatitself.The lastreason notto throwoutthe text-bookisitsemphasison inﬂation expecta-tions, aswell asunemployment. Inﬂationexpectationshave sagged while the labourmarkethasrecovered. Accordingto theNewYorkFed, theytookanotherdive inMay. Self-fulﬁllingexpectationscould ex-plain lowinﬂation and exonerate the Phil-lipscurve. Instead, theycall into questionthe credibilityofthe Fed’spromise to hit itsinﬂation target. 7The American economyFindingPhillipsWASHINGTON, DCThe missing trade-oﬀbetween inﬂation and unemploymentDouble downUnited StatesSource: Federal Reserve*Excluding food and energy†Federal Open Market CommitteeCore PCE inflation*, % increase on a year earlierUnemployment, %2009101112131415161700.51.01.52.02.5Federal Reserve target200910111213141516170246810Unemployment rateFOMC† sustainable unemployment estimates, midpointThe EconomistJune17th2017 Financeandeconomics67WHENJeremyCorbyn unveiled hisLabourmanifesto aheadofthe recentBritish election, opponentsgawked at pledgesto renationalise the postal and rail systems. Such enthusiasm forstate ownership smacksofa philosophylongsince abandonedbyleaderson both leftand right. Despite Labour’sdecentelector-al performance, nationalisation isnoteverywhere on the march;on June 5th Donald Trump made publichisdesire to privatise air-traﬃccontrol. Butthe rise ofMrCorbyn and Bernie Sanders hintsata weakeningofthe rich-world consensusthatthe less oftheeconomyowned bygovernment, the better. Thatisa pity. Ex-panded state ownership isa poorwayto cure economicailments.Formuch ofthe 20th century, economistswere open to a bit ofdirigisme. Maurice Allais, an (admittedlyFrench) economist whowon the Nobel prize in 1988, recommended thatthe governmentrun a fewﬁrmsin each industry, the betterto observe the relativemeritsofpublicand private ownership. Economistsoften em-brace state control asa solution to marketfailure. Since there isnowayto provide national securityonlyto citizenswho sign up topayforitwhile denyingitto the rest, itrequiresa governmentwith the powerto taxto provide defence. In casesofnatural mo-nopoly, in transportand telecommunications, nationalisation isan alternative to allowinga dominantﬁrm to use itsmarket pow-erto overcharge forsubparservice. And state control looks attrac-tive when private marketsare bad atprovidinguniversal accessto critical services. Private schoolsorhealth insurers have an in-centive to skim oﬀthe best-prepared studentsand healthiest pa-tients, and to denyservicesto hardercases, creatinga large poolofpeople thatcannotproﬁtablybe served. Butin the 1970seconomistscame to see state ownership as acostlyﬁxto such problems. Ownersofprivate ﬁrmsbeneﬁt di-rectlywhen innovation reducescostsand boostsproﬁts; bureau-cratsusuallylacksuch a clearﬁnancial incentive to improve per-formance. Firmswith the backingofthe state are lessvulnerableto competition; astheylumberon theyhoard resourcesthatcould be betterused elsewhere. Inattention to cost-cutting isnotalwaysa ﬂaw. OliverHart, co-winneroflastyear’sNobel prize foreconomics, pointed to private prisonsasa case in which proﬁt-fo-cused managersmightaccepta cost-eﬃcientdecline in the wel-fare ofprisonersthatsocietywould prefernotto have. Yetecono-mistssawin the productivityslowdown ofthe 1970sevidencethatan overreachingstate wasthrottlingeconomicdynamism.MrCorbyn ﬁrstwon election to parliamentwhen the Tory gov-ernmentofMargaretThatcher, inspired byMilton Friedman, wasbusilysellingoﬀbitsofstate ﬁrmslike British Leyland (the nation-alised carmaker), British Airwaysand whatwasthen called Brit-ish Petroleum. Othergovernmentsfollowed suitalthough publicassetsin mostcountriesremain large (see right-hand chart).State-owned ﬁrmspose risksbeyond thatto dynamism. Gov-ernment-run companiesmayprioritise swollen payrollsovercustomersatisfaction. More worryingly, state ﬁrmscan becomevehiclesforcorruption, used to dole outthe largesse of the stateto favoured backersorto funnel social wealth into the pocketsofthe powerful. Asstate control overthe economygrows, politicalconnectionsbecome a surerroute to businesssuccessthan entre-preneurialism. Even botched privatisationscan improve gover-nance in corruption-plagued emergingeconomies. Ifantipathyto nationalisation isfading, however, that haslessto do with newfound conﬁdence in state competence and morewith disappointmentin private business. Although studies typi-callyﬁnd thatcountrieswith more ofthe economyunder statecontrol growmore slowlythan those with less, much ofthe richworld—includingenthusiasticprivatiserslike America and Brit-ain—islimpingthrough productivitydoldrums. High corporateproﬁtssuggestthatprivate marketsare nothotbedsof cut-throatcompetition.

Tech dynamoslike Google and Facebook de-lightconsumers, butthese companiesincreasinglywield unset-tlingeconomicand social power.

Modern formsofpublicownership are designed to look morebenign than the old models.

Of-ten, rather, theyare deliberate targets, shotbypoachers, who wanttheirivory; byfarmers, because ofthe damage theydo tocrops; and bycattle herders, who see themascompetitorsforforage. In August2016 the resultofthe GreatElephantCensus, the mostextensive countofa wild specieseverattempted, suggest-ed thatabout350,000 African savannahelephantsremain alive. Thisisdown by140,000 since 2007. The census, conductedbya team led byMike Chase, an ecologistbased in Botswana, and paid forbyPaul Al-len, one ofthe foundersofMicrosoft, un-dertookalmost500,000km ofaerial sur-veysto come to itsconclusion—though theteam were unable to include forestele-megafauna. Elephants, aboutasunrelatedto human beingsasanymammal can be,seem neverthelessto have evolved intelli-gence, and possiblyeven consciousness.Though theymaynotbe alone in this(sim-ilarclaimsare made forcertain whales, so-cial carnivoresand a fewbirds), they arecertainlypartofa small and selectgroup.Losingeven one example ofhowintelli-gence comesaboutand makesitsliving inthe wild would notonlybe a shame in itsown right, itwould also diminish the abili-tyofbiologistsofthe future to understandthe process, and thushowithappened tohuman beings.Mostofwhatisknown aboutelephantsocietyhasbeen found outbySTE’sstudyin Samburuand byan even longer-run-ningproject, led byCynthia Moss, at Am-boseli National Park, in the country’ssouth. Both use a mixture ofgood, old-fashioned ﬁeldcraftand high-tech radiocollarsthatpermitindividual animals tobe tracked around bysatellite. DrMossbegan herworkin Amboseli in1972, aftercollaboratingin Tanzania withIain Douglas-Hamilton, a zoologistwhohad been studyingthe animalssince 1965(and who is, coincidentally, the uncle ofourBooksand Artseditor).

Thoughmalesdeparttheirnatal group when matu-ritybeckonsatthe age of12, femalesusual-lyremain in itthroughouttheirlives. Within a group, mostadultfemaleshave, atanygiven moment, a single, de-pendentcalf. Theywill notgive birth againuntil thisoﬀspringisself-suﬃcient, whichtakesaboutfouryears. From a male pointofview, sexuallyreceptive femalesaretherefore a rare commodity, to be soughtoutand often foughtover. Such competi-tion meansthat, though capable offather-hood from the age ofabout14, a male willbe luckyto achieve itbefore he isin his20s.Until thattime arrives, he will be seen oﬀbystrongerrivals.Were thisall there wasto elephant soci-ety, itwould still be quite complexbymammalian standards—similarin scope tothatoflions, which also live in matriarchalfamilygroupsthatejectmaturingmales.Butitwould notdeserve DrWittemyer’saccolade ofnear-human sophistication.Unlike lions, however, elephantshavehigherlevelsoforganisation, notimmedi-atelyobviousto the observer, thatare in-deed quite humanlike. Firstofall, familiesare partof wider“kinship” groupsthatcome togetherandseparate asthe fancytakesthem. Familiescommune with each otherin thiswayabout10% ofthe time. On top ofthis, eachkinship group ispartofwhatDrDouglas-Hamilton, a Scot, callsa clan. Clans tend togatherin the dryseason, when the amountofhabitatcapable ofsupportingelephantsisrestricted. Within a clan, relations aregenerallyfriendly. All clan membersareknown to one anotherand, since a clanwill usuallyhave atleast100 adultmem-bers, and mayhave twice that, thismeansan adult(an adultfemale, atleast) can re-cognise and have meaningful social rela-tionswith thatmanyotherindividuals. Aﬁgure ofbetween 100 and 200 ac-quaintancesissimilarto the numberofpeople with whom a human beingcanmaintain a meaningful social relation-ship—a value known asDunbar’snumber,afterRobin Dunbar, the psychologistwhoproposed it. Dunbar’snumberforpeople isabout150. Itisprobablyno coincidencethatthisreﬂectsthe maximum size of thehuman clansofthose who make theirliv-ingbyhuntingand gathering, and whospend mostoftheirlivesin smallergroupsofrelatives, separated from otherclanmembers, scouringthe landscape forfood.Dealingwith so manypeers, and re-memberingdetailsofsuch large ranges,meanselephantsrequire enormousmem-ories. Detailsofhowtheirbrainswork are,beyond mattersofbasicanatomy, rathersketchy. Butone thingwhich isknown isthattheyhave bighippocampuses. Thesestructures, one in each cerebral hemi-sphere, are involved in the formation oflong-term memories. Compared with thesize ofitsbrain, an elephant’shippocam-pusesare about40% largerthan those of ahuman being, suggestingthatthe old prov-erb aboutan elephantneverforgettingmayhave a grain oftruth in it.Àla recherche du temps perduIn the ﬁeld, the value ofthe memories thusstored increaseswith age. Matriarchs, usu-allythe oldestelephantin a familygroup,knowa lot. The studiesin Amboseli andSamburuhave shown that, in timesoftrouble such asa local drought, this knowl-edge permitsthem to lead theirgroups toother, richerpasturesvisited in the past.Though notactivelytaught(atleast, asfarasisknown) such geographical informa-tion ispassed down the generationsby ex-perience. Indeed, elephantbiologists be-lieve the abilityofthe youngto beneﬁt byand learn from the wisdom ofthe old isone ofthe mostimportantreasonsfor theexistence ofgroups—anotherthingele-phantsshare with people. Group livingbringsfurtheradvantages,aswell—mostnotablythose ofcollectivedefence. For, though mostpredatorsapartfrom humansarmed with riﬂeswouldhesitate to attackan adultelephant, theywill happilytake on a youngster. Alonemotherwould be able to defend hercalfagainsta single such predator, butmanycarnivores, particularlylionsand hyenas,come in pridesorpacks. The solidarity ofsisterhood meansa group ofelephants canusuallydeterattacksbyitsmere existence,and ifdeterrence doesnotwork, then col-lective defence usuallydoes. Here, again,experience seemsto count. Data collectedbyDrMoss’steam suggestthatgroupsledbyyoungmatriarchsare more vulnerableto predation than those with olderleaders.Norisitonlyin theirsocial arrange-mentsthatelephantsshowsignsofparal-lel evolution with humans. Theyalsoseem to have a capacityforsolvingpro-blemsbythinkingaboutthem in abstractterms. Thisishard to demonstrate in thewild, foranyevidence isnecessarily anec-dotal. Butexperimentsconducted on do-mesticated Asian elephants(easierto dealwith than African ones) showthattheycan use novel objectsastoolsto obtain out-of-reach food withouttrial and error be-forehand.

But, asitsname suggests, Save theElephantswasnotsetup solelyforthe dis-interested pursuitofknowledge. Indeed,ashasoften proved the wayin ﬁeld studiesofotherspecies, the focusofalmost all ele-phantresearchers, notjustthose in Kenya,hasshifted from understandingthe ani-malsto preservingthem.Though poachingisstill a threat in Ken-ya, changesin land use nowseem an equalhazard. The human inhabitantsofthe areaaround the Samburureserve (some ofwhom have given theirtribal name to theplace) have traditionallymade theirlivingsaspastoralists, drivingherdsofcattle fromgrazingplace to grazingplace. One sourceofconﬂictwith elephantshasbeen compe-tition forpasture asthe herders’ popula-tionshave grown. Indeed, the reserve itselfisnowsometimesinvaded bycowherdsand theirstock.

Satellite maps arean importanttool fordoingso. Formal au-thoritiesin the countrycan take them intoaccount, but, equallyimportant, thesemapsare also quite persuasive in the pub-licmeetingsatwhich local tribesmen agreeon the use ofwhatiscollectivelyheld land.Such meetingscan assentto the legal “ga-zetting” ofthe corridorsin question, to stopthem beingbuilton orfenced, so that ele-phantscan passfreely.Thisapproach can workata largerscale, aswell. Anewrailwayfrom Momba-sa to Nairobi, forexample, hasbeen pro-vided with elephantunderpassesonroutesused bythe beasts—though an unin-tended consequence hasbeen to encour-age settlementnearthese transitpoints,which are useful forpeople, too. In the caseofSamburuthe satellite mapswill be ofgreatvalue ifa proposed “developmentcorridor”, runninginland from a plannedexpansion ofthe portofLamu, goesahead,asthismaybringa newhighway, railwayand oil pipeline through land much usedbyelephants.Understandingelephants’ behaviouralso permitsitto be manipulated in waysthathelp reduce directconﬂictbetweenelephantsand people. One such projectharnesseselephants’ fearofbee swarms.Beesare the onlyanimalsapartfromhumansthatelephantsseem trulyafraidof. Anecdotally, thishasbeen known for alongtime. Butthe matterhasnowbeenstudied scientiﬁcallybyLucyKing, a re-searcheratOxford Universitywho isalsopartofSTE. DrKingproved the anecdotescorrectbyplayingthe sound ofa swarm ofangrybeesto wild elephants, and video-ingthe instant, panicked ﬂightitprovoked.The reason forthispanicisthat, although abee’sstingcannotpenetrate mostparts ofan elephant’shide, swarmsofbeestend togo forthe eyesand the tip ofthe trunk, apachyderm’smostvulnerable parts. Beesare enemiesthatno amountofcollectivedefence can discourage.Armed with thatknowledge, DrKingand hercolleague FritzVollrath came upwith the idea ofprotectingfarmswith beefences. The sortoffence mostKenyansmallholderscan aﬀord istoo ﬂimsy to ex-clude an elephant. Buta bee fence, thoughﬂimsierstill, doesthe job. Itconsist ofpairsofpolesaboutthree metresapart, betweenwhich beehivescan be hunglike ham-mocks. The hivesthemselvesare ten me-tresapart, and the polesare all connectedbya single strand ofwire 1.5 metresabovethe ground. Thisarrangementisenough to stop ele-phantsin theirtracks.

The trail ofblood ofwhatGillesKepel callsthe “third wave” ofjihad growseverlonger. The ﬁrstofMrKepel’swavesfeatured ﬁghtersagainstthe SovietUnionin Afghanistan and then againstArab re-gimes. The second wasled byOsama binLaden, who turned from the “nearenemy”to the “farenemy”, ie, America. The third ismade up ofloose networksofradical Mus-limsin the Westwho murderwith little orno control from al-Qaeda or, latterly, Islam-icState (IS). Some thinkIS islashingoutabroad asitlosesground in Iraq and Syria.Perhaps. Buteven ifthe physical “caliph-ate” isdestroyed, the jihadistempire ofthemind seemsbound to endure. MrKepel haslongbeen atthe forefrontofscholarship on Islamistradicalism. Hislatestbookexamineshowthe third wavewashed overFrance. Hisworkbearsstudy-ing: atleastuntil thisyear’sattacksin Brit-ain, France appeared to be the main incu-batorofEuropean jihadism. MrKepel putsthe turningpointataround 2005: the yearwhen AbuMusab al-Suri (real name: Mus-tafa Setmariam Nasar) published a 1,600-page tractentitled “The Call forGlobal Is-lamicResistance”. YouTube waslaunchedthatsame year, givingjihadistsa direct, viv-id meansofpublicisingtheirgrislydeedsand radicalisingMuslims. Finally, it wasthe yearwhen the alienated banlieuesofFrench citieserupted in riots. The seedsofnationalism, both promisinga newUtopiain place ofthe workers’ paradise thatdiedwith the demise ofcommunism. Sadly, forthose lookingforanswers, MrKepel’slastchapterbecomesmired in abstractionsthattranslate poorlyfrom the French.Ali Soufan, a Lebanese-born former FBIinvestigator, describesthe othercircle ofji-hadism: open-frontjihad. “AnatomyofTer-ror” tellsthe storiesofthe leadersof al-Qaeda and IS. MrKepel’sand MrSoufan’sdiﬀerentstylesand focusesreﬂectthe ex-periencesofthe two authors, one an aca-demicand the othera law-enforcementpractitioner. Theyalso saysomethingaboutcontrastingEuropean and Americanpriorities: forEuropeansthe pressing dan-gerisathome; forAmerica, the main ene-miesare still the organised groupsabroad.MrSoufan isathismostinteresting indescribingin detail the ambiguousrole ofIran in the arrest, and then the release, ofsenioral-Qaeda ﬁguresﬂeeingAfghani-stan—includingHamza bin Laden,Osama’sson—to be used “eitheraslever-age orasattackdogs”. MrSoufan hasawarning, too: asISisworn down, and itsdispute with al-Qaeda overthe declara-tion ofthe caliphate becomesmoot, thetwo movementscould reunite, posinganeven gravermenace to the West. Hisrec-ommendationsare mostlygeneralitiesaboutﬁghtingjihadism with “an entirelynewnarrative”, buthe makesone particu-larlysensible point: the Westshould makebetteruse ofrehabilitated formerjihadistsforideological counter-propaganda.One reason thatneitherbookentirelysatisﬁesisthatthe struggle against jihad-ism maybe too current, too diﬀuse and inpartstoo inaccessible to write about fully.The bestapproximation maybe the note-booksofjournalistswho write the ﬁrstdraftofhistoryfrom the ﬁeld. Souad Me-khennet, a German ofTurkish-Moroccan jihad were also fertilisedbythe memoryofFrench colonialism in north Africa, theexperience ofFrench prisonsand the prox-imityofthe warin Syria, which provided acall to armsand militarytraining.AbuMusab al-Suri wasprescientwhenhe spoke oftwo concentriccirclesof jihad:small-cell orsolo jihad using“urban orsuburban gangwarfare” with the aim of“tiringthe enemyand makinghim reach astate ofcollapse and retreat”, especiallyinEurope; and, when conditionspermit, “ji-had ofopen fronts” in Muslim landsde-signed to seize territoryand establish an Is-lamicstate.

The British journalistthinkscitiessuch asLondon orMalmo inSweden have been irrevocablychanged bymigration. European culture hasbeen di-minished bya mixture ofself-abnegationand political correctness, while decliningChristian valueshave leftmostwesternEuropean countriesunmoored. StrandsofIslam, he feels, are bringingwith them thekindsofprejudicesanyliberal societyshould abhor. Terrorism, sexual assaultand female genital mutilation are, in histelling, all on the rise.MrMurraybacksup thisbleakvisionwith reportingfrom squalid refugee campsin Greece; from asylum sheltersin Ger-many; and from a conference held bytheSweden Democrats, a right-wingpoliticalparty. The central eventin the bookis themigration crisisof2015, in which over1masylum-seekersfrom Syria, Afghanistan,Iraq and elsewhere came to Europe (mostto Germanyand Sweden). ButMrMurray’sviewshave also been formed byfourde-cadesin Britain. The Muslim population ofEngland and Walesincreased from 1.5m in2001to 2.7m in 2011.The authordoeshiton some unfortu-nate truths. The migrantcrisisof2015 wasunexpected, butalso badlymanaged bythe European Union. Lawsto combatanti-Islamichate speech tend to clamp downon free expression, and worsen the ten-sions. The policyofisolatinganti-migrantpartiestended to make them even morepopular: when the Sweden Democratswere ﬁrstelected into parliamentwith 5%ofthe vote in 2010, otherpoliticians“treated the newMPsaspariahs”. Thepartyisnowone ofthe mostpopularinSweden, scoring24% in recentopinionpolls. In some placesthe police orsocialserviceshave indeed failed to actagainstpathologiesin Muslim communities, fear-ful ofbeingtarred with racism. The bookwould beneﬁt, however, fromfarmore reporting. Meetingan Afghan asy-lum-seekerwho had been tortured andraped bythe Taliban, MrMurraymomen-tarilyseemsto understand the “generousinstinct” thatled European politicians towelcome refugeestwo yearsago. Butinsupportofhisidea thatIslam hasno placein Europe, he letsfeartrump analysis. Hecitespollsshowingthatvotersworryaboutthe numberofimmigrants, butnotthose showingthatpeople vastlyoveresti-mate those numbers.

The bookwaspublished inGerman fouryearsago and hasnowbeenwell translated byDavid Dollenmayer,with much supportfrom the author. Though considered a German latter-dayShakespeare, Goethe ismuch lesswidelyread in the English-speakingworldthan athome. The one exception is“Faust”,hismostfamouswork, on which he la-boured on and oﬀformostofhislife.Worksabouthim in English are thin on theground, and mostofwhatthere iscameoutsome time ago. Two volumesofa bio-graphybyNicholasBoyle ofCambridgeUniversityhave been published to greatacclaim, butthe third and ﬁnal volume hasyetto appear. So thisnewaccountof theGerman literarylegend ﬁllsa gap.Goethe wasa man ofprotean talents,interests, appetitesand achievements wholived through a particularlytempestuousperiod ofwarsand revolutionsin Europe.Born in 1749 into a prosperousand well-connected familyin Frankfurt, he had writ-ten a bestseller, “The SorrowsofYoungWerther”, bythe age of25 and had estab-lished a glitteringreputation. Butafter awhile he began to feel thathe wanted to ex-perience the world atﬁrsthand, not justwrite aboutit. The opportunitycamewhen the youngDuke Karl AugustofSaxe-Weimarinvited Goethe to come and workforhim. The writereventuallybecame ﬁ-nance minister, and he and the prince end-ed up aslifelongfriends. While atcourtin WeimarGoethe con-tinued to write, and to build up a networkofrelationshipswith the cultural and intel-lectual elite ofthe time, includinga deepand long-lastingfriendship with Schiller, afellowpoet, writerand protagonistof theSturm und Drang(storm and urge) move-ment. Goethe also pursued a plethora ofotherinterests, includingnatural history,anatomyand mineralogy, and developedacontroversial theoryofcolour. When lifeatKarl August’scourtbecame too much, hetookhimselfto Italyforhisown version ofthe Grand Tour, before eventuallyreturn-ingto Weimar.In hislifetime, Goethe wasfamous notonlyforhisliteraryachievementsand po-litical and artisticconnections, but also forthe numberand varietyofhisromanticpursuits, rangingfrom innkeepers’ daugh-tersto the cream ofsociety. (Some of thesewomen were attainable, some not.) He didnotsettle into a long-term relationship un-til he wasnearly40. Christiane Vulpius,the objectofhisaﬀectionsand soon to bethe motherofhisson, August, wasso farbelowhissocial statusthatmarriageseemed outofthe question, though twodecadeslaterthe two did quietlywed. Hefaroutlived herand retained hiscapacityforfallingin love to an advanced age, pro-posingto a 19-year-old when he wasin hisearly70s. She turned him down.Bythen the arcofGoethe’slife wasde-scending. Hisgreatfriend Schillerhad beendead fordecades, and the ranksofotherfriendswere thinningrapidly. Hisprincelychampion Karl Augustdied in 1828, fol-lowed two yearslaterbyGoethe’sownson. Forhis82nd birthdaythe old mantookhistwo grandsonson a ﬁnal visit to alocal mountain retreatwhere asa youngman he had scratched a poem into thewall, and waspleased to ﬁnd itstill there:Peace liesoverAll the peaksIn all the treesYou senseHardlya breath;The little forestbirdsfall silent.Wait, and soonYou too will rest.Sixmonthslater, in the springof1832, Goe-the suddenlyfell ill, declined rapidly anddied soon afterwards. Halfa centuryearli-erhe had written to a friend thathe hopedto “raise up ashigh aspossible the pyramidofmyexistence”. Hiswish wasextrava-gantlygranted. 7FictionThe death ofideologyAFTERSeptember11th 2001Brian VanReetdropped outofuniversity,joined the American army, foughtin Iraqand wasawarded a medal forvalour.

Setin 2003, duringthe earlydaysofthe invasion ofIraq, the novel centres onthree protagonists: Sleed, an Americantanker, Cassandra Wigheard, a 19-year-old on herﬁrstdeployment, and AbuAl-Hool, a veteran Egyptian jihadistwhose brotherhood ofﬁghtershastrav-elled from Afghanistan to Iraq to wagewaron America. Pivotingaround anattackduringwhich Cassandra and twofellowsoldiersare taken prisonerby thejihadists, the novel jumpsbackand forthin time and shiftsbetween the threecharacters’ perspectives, graduallyre-vealinghoweach ofthem hascome toplaya keyrole in a conﬂicttheydo notfullyunderstand.MrVan Reetavoidsthe pitfall of at-temptingto write from an Iraqi point ofview, instead relayingeventsthrough theeyesofhisforeign protagonists, all ofwhom are blinded bytheirown biases.In doingso, he subtlyconveyshowthebattle theyare ﬁghtingisa proxy warbetween opposingideologies, none ofthem Iraqi. Consumed with theirownagendas, hischaractersfail to grasp—ormuch care about—the impactoftheiractionson the local population. “Spoils”isa timelynovel with strikingrelevanceto the currentwarin Syria, increasinglyshaped and sustained byforeign interestsand intervention.Asthe novel advances, all three pro-tagonistsquestion theirbeliefsin the faceofthe brutal realitiesofcombat.

Cassandra isunderno illusionsaboutthe hollownessofarmyrhetoric, which trainssoldiers to“liberate” the Iraqi people by“joggingincadence to cute little dittiesabout slaugh-ter”. Isolated in captivity, she isforced toassesshowfarherloyaltyextends. Setovereightweeks, the novel is anuanced departure from the usual plot-driven warthriller. There are no “goodguys” in “Spoils”. There are no truly“badguys” either. MrVan Reetpaintsa har-rowingpicture ofthe dangersofpropa-ganda and the true costof“collateraldamage”.

Wheneverrealityconﬂictswith hisaims, he rejectsthe verynotion oftruth: ashe tellshisdoctor afteran unwelcome diagnosis, “Yourproblem,Henry, isthatyouare hungup on words,on labels, thatyoubelieve theymean whattheyseem to mean.” He isthin-skinned,and obsessed with loyalty, powerand pub-licdisplaysofdominance. “I have clout,”he proclaims. “Alot.” Hisresponse when-everanyone questionshisostentatiouslyfalse claimsisa threatto “destroy” hisinter-locutor.

He spentthe remain-derofhiscareerasarguablythe mostfeared attorneyin NewYork.The play’sﬁrstpartpremiered in 1991,and wasperformed atthe National The-atre in London the nextyear.

Nowthatthe AIDS crisishasreceded and gaycivilrightshave become standard in rich West-ern countries, a seven-hourplayabout gaylife in Ronald Reagan’sAmerica mightrisklookinganachronistic. ButmanysubplotsofMrKushner’skaleidoscopicwork, fromperformative, vulnerable masculinitytoconﬂictswithin the progressive move-ment, are still fresh today.In “Angels”, Royservesasan object les-son in the costofself-deceit. Asin real life,he isgay, deeplycloseted, dyingofAIDS—which, even in hisﬁnal months, he insiststo the publicislivercancer—and accusedoframpantethical violations. Feeling ob-liged to lie abouta central truth of hislife,he growsso accustomed to deception thatitbecomessecond nature. And he will stopatnothingto maintain hisveneerofinvin-cibility. Joe, a closeted, strait-laced Mor-mon, ﬁnallyloseshisfaith in Roywhen heasksJoe to abuse a job he hasbeen oﬀeredin the attorney-general’soﬃce in order toprotectRoyfrom disbarment.Thisisa faithful representation ofCohn, a formative inﬂuence on MrTrump.AsPeterFraser, Cohn’sﬁnal lover, told theNewYorkTimeslastyear, “I hearRoyin thethingshe saysquite clearly—thatbravado,and ifyousayitaggressivelyand loudlyenough, it’sthe truth. That’sthe wayRoyused to operate to a degree, and Donaldwascertainlyhisapprentice.” The presi-dentdeveloped hisapproach to adversar-iesbywatchingCohn humiliate them, inthe media and in court: he once describedhisattack-dogattorneyas“viciousto oth-ersin hisprotection ofme”.Political punditshave consistently mis-read MrTrump, predictingeitherthat hisstarwould fade or, later, thathe wouldhave to adaptto conventional expecta-tionsofthe presidency. MrKushner’sscriptwould have provided a more accurateprognostication. Royneverchangeshisspots, remaininghateful even on hisdeath-bed: “Betterdead than red!” he screamsatthe ghostofEthel Rosenberg, the accusedRussian spyhe had helped send to the elec-tricchair30 yearsearlier. He refusestoshare hispreciousstash ofAZT, an experi-mental AIDS drug, with hisnurse Belize,even when Roy’sloomingdeath meanshehasno more use forthe pills. Those stillwaitingforCohn’sformerclientto “pivot”towardsthe centre should take note. Andthe lesson MrTrump hastaken fromCohn’sultimate defeatatthe handsof hat-ed bureaucrats—he wasdisbarred a fewweeksbefore he died in 1986—wasnottheimportance ofplayingbythe rulesbutratherthe perilsofbeinglaid lowby ill-ness. In the president’srecollection, “theyonlygot[Cohn] because he wasso sick”: amemorythatmayhelp explain hispub-lishinga letterfrom hisdoctorduring the2016 campaign claimingMrTrump wouldbe the healthiestpresidenteverelected.MrKushner’sdepiction ofthe schismsthatReagan opened up in the Americanleftalso beara stern message fortoday’sDemocraticParty. In the wake ofHillaryClinton’sdefeat, politiciansfrom both theleft(Bernie Sanders) and centre (Joe Biden)have recommended downplayingidentitypolitics, such assupportforthe Black LivesMattermovementortransgenderrights, inthe hopesofwinningbackthe white work-ingclass.

EastAfricaChinaIndiaRest ofAsiaGlobal CO2emissions from energy useremained roughly ﬂat in 2016, accordingto a report from BP, a big oil ﬁrm. A year-on-year increase of 0.1% was well belowthe ten-year average growth rate of 1.6%.Improved energy eﬃciency and a slowingglobal economy were partly responsible.China also played a part: the countryremains the world’s largest source of CO2but its emissions fell by 41m tonnes in2016, partly thanks to weakness in someenergy-intensive industries. In contrast,India’s emissions increased by 114mtonnes last year. The landscape haschanged over the past quarter-century.In 2016 the Asia-Paciﬁc region producedalmost half of global emissions, up from25% in 1990. 78The EconomistJune17th2017WHENthe ancientGreeksmade theirwhirlwindsfemale, bird-wingedHarpyiai tearingup the riggingofships, itmaynothave been forchauvinisticrea-sons. Afterall, shaggybearded Boreas wasthe north wind, and pretty-boyZephyrus,with hishorn ofﬂowers, the westwind;gruﬀAioloskeptthem all tied up in a bag,and all-male thunderingZeusruled the lot.In latercenturies, too, Christian places sim-plynamed theirstormsafterthe saints,male orfemale, on whose feasttheyfell: sothatPuerto Rico washitin the 19th centurybyboth Santa Ana and San Felipe. Thingsbegan to go awryaround then,however, when ClementWragge, a Britishmeteorologistworkingin the Paciﬁc, beganto name stormsafterPolynesian beauties.Theygotworse in 1941when George Stew-artpublished “Storm”, a bestsellingﬁction-al biographyofa hurricane called Maria;and in 1951, when “TheyCall the WindMaria” from “PaintYourWagon”, wasem-braced bybeltingbaritoneseverywhere.Meanwhile, in the war, American navalmeteorologistshad taken to trackingstormsbynamingthem aftertheirwivesand girlfriends, much asbomberpilotsliked to paintcurvystarletson their air-craft. The feminisation ofdestruction be-came so normal thatin 1953 the NationalWeatherService made the practice oﬃcial. RoxcyBolton ofCoral Gables, in Flori-da, didn’tlike thisone bit. Livingin Ameri-ca’smosthurricane-prone state, she knewﬁrst-hand the devastation theycaused.When she heard the weathermen saythatCarol had destroyed Louisiana, orBetsyhad torn up Mobile, she wasfuriousat thesluron women. These windswere notonlyannihilatingbutunpredictable, dith-eringaboutoﬀshore and then ﬂouncingoﬀsomewhere else. Oh, howlike women.She feltso burned up thatin 1970 she decid-ed to tackle the meteorologistsdirectly.There wasalreadyplentyon herplate.Asa founderofthe Florida chapterof theNational Organisation ofWomen, she wasﬁghtingforequal payand equal rights,mandatorymaternityleave, more womenon task-forcesand reform ofFlorida’sstat-utesto widen the deﬁnition ofrape. “Youmustdo the thingsyouthinkyoucannotdo,” said EleanorRoosevelt, and the wordsrangloud in herears. She wasforever onthe go, hostingmeetingsin herkitchenwhen the children had leftforschool,houndingthe legislature (“Tell him RoxcyBolton’scalling; it’san emergency!”) andsendingoutﬁerce typed letters, thoughdrafted ﬁrston ﬂowerypaper, to the man-agersofmen-onlylunch roomsin Miami’sbigdepartmentstores. Backtheycamegrovelling: both the Men’sGrille atBur-dine’sand the Captain’sTable atJordanMarsh agreed to letin women. Shesparred, too, with the managerofthe Play-boyPlaza Hotel, askinghowhe and hismale staﬀwould like to walkaround withawad ofcotton fora tail. Well, would they? In the thickofall this, she went regular-lyto pesterthe men atthe National Hurri-cane Centre in Miami. And she gotprecise-lynowhere. The ﬁrsttime, theyjustthoughtherobjectionswere asfunnyasheck. Whynotname stormsaftersenatorsinstead? she suggested. (Asan old-lineDemocrat, she thought“Hurricane Gold-water” had a greatringto it.) Insulting tothe Senate! theycried. Howaboutnamingthem afterbirds, then? The Audubon Soci-etywouldn’tstand forit, theysaid. Theycared more aboutsenatorsand birdsthanwomen, evidently. And theytookher, withherneatdresses, white glovesand bouf-fanthair, asa pushoverJackie Kennedylookalike. Butshe wasequal partspit-bull,apioneerfarmer’sdaughterfrom dirt-poorDuckHill, Mississippi who neverdroppedatopicshe cared about. Never. Havingplanted the thought, atany rate,she wentbackto everythingelse that need-ed doing. (“Ifthe BackFortyhasto behayed, yougo hay.”) She had the EqualRightsAmendmentto getthrough Con-gress, though sadlyitfailed. She promptedRichard Nixon to proclaim August26th asWomen’sRightsDay, setup a refuge forbattered women, and in 1974 opened in Mi-ami the ﬁrstproperrape-treatmentcentrein the country. Then in 1978— hallelujah!—the National WeatherService gave in.Henceforth hurricaneswould have maleand female namesalternately, and the ﬁrst,Hurricane Bob (Barrywould have been alotbetter), whirled in in 1979. On the streets ofCoral GablesThough itseemed a sideshowto some, toheritwasone ofherbiggestvictories, andimportantin wayspeople failed to realise.Makingsome stormsmale wasnevercon-vincinglyproved to have made a diﬀer-ence to publicawarenessorpublicsafety,butthatwasnotherpoint. Hercampaignwasa step towardsimprovingsociety’swhole attitude to women.She thought, forexample, ofLianne, ayoungblackwoman she knewin Coral Ga-bles, who though she had a master’sineducation wore a brown bagfora dress.She had had a baby, the babyhad died andherhusband had divorced her; she was onthe streetand couldn’tcope with life, soMrsBolton often talked to her, and broughthergritsand eggsfrom a restaurant.
