TheHarvard psychologistfound ev-erypupil learningthe same top-icin the same wayatthe samespeed. Afewdayslaterhe builthisﬁrst“teachingmachine”,which letchildren tackle ques-tionsattheirown pace. Bythe mid-1960ssimilargizmoswerebeingﬂogged bydoor-to-doorsalesmen. Within a fewyears,though, enthusiasm forthem had ﬁzzled out.Since then education technology(edtech) hasrepeated thecycle ofhype and ﬂop, even ascomputershave reshaped al-mosteveryotherpartoflife. One reason isthe conservatism ofteachersand theirunions. Butanotheristhatthe brain-stretch-ingpotential ofedtech hasremained unproven. Today, however, Skinner’sheirsare forcingthe sceptics tothinkagain (see page 16). Backed bybillionaire techiessuch asMarkZuckerbergand Bill Gates, schoolsaround the world areusingnewsoftware to “personalise” learning. Thiscould helphundredsofmillionsofchildren stuckin dismal classes—butonlyifedtech boosterscan resistthe temptation to reviveharmful ideasabouthowchildren learn. To succeed, edtechmustbe atthe service ofteaching, notthe otherway around. Pencils downThe conventional model ofschoolingemerged in Prussia inthe 18th century. Alternativeshave so farfailed to teach asmanychildren aseﬃciently. Classrooms, hierarchical year-groups, standardised curriculumsand ﬁxed timetables are stillthe norm formostofthe world’snearly1.5bn schoolchildren. Too manydo notreach theirpotential. In poorcountriesonlya quarterofsecondaryschoolchildren acquire atleastabasicknowledge ofmaths, readingand science. Even in themostlyrich countriesofthe OECDabout30% ofteenagersfailto reach proﬁciencyin atleastone ofthese subjects. Thatshare hasremained almostunchanged overthe past 15years, duringwhich billionshave been spenton ITin schools.By2012 there wasone computerforeverytwo pupilsin severalrich countries. Australia had more computersthan pupils.Handled poorly, devicescan distract. APortuguese study from2010 found thatschoolswith slowbroadband and a ban onsitessuch asYouTube had betterresultsthan high-tech ones.Whatmattersishowedtech isused. One wayitcan help isthrough bespoke instruction. Eversince Philip II ofMacedonhired Aristotle to prepare hisson AlexanderforGreatness, richparentshave paid fortutors. Reformersfrom São Paulo toStockholm thinkthatedtech can putindividual attentionwithin reach ofall pupils. American schoolsare embracing themodel mostreadily. Athird ofpupilsare in a school districtthathaspledged to introduce “personalised, digital learning”. Themethodsofgroupslike SummitPublicSchools, whose soft-ware waswritten fornothingbyFacebookengineers, are beingcopied byhundredsofschools.In India, where abouthalfofchildren leave primary schoolunable to read a simple text, the curriculum goesover manypupils’ heads. “Adaptive” software such asMindsparkcanworkoutwhata child knowsand pose questionsaccordingly.Arecentpaperfound thatIndian children usingMindsparkafterschool made some ofthe largestgainsin mathsand read-ingofanyeducation studyin poorcountries. The otherwayedtech can aid learningisbymakingschoolsmore productive. In California schoolsare usingsoftware tooverhaul the conventional model. Instead oftextbooks, pupilshave “playlists”, which theyuse to accessonline lessons andtake tests. The software assesseschildren’sprogress, lighteningteachers’ markingload and givingthem insighton their pupils.Saved teachers’ time isallocated to othertasks, such as foster-ingpupils’ social skillsorone-on-one tuition. Astudy in 2015suggested thatchildren in earlyadoptersofthismodel scorebetterin teststhan theirpeersatotherschools. Payattention atthe backSuch innovation iswelcome. Butmakingthe bestofedtechmeansgettingseveral thingsright. First, “personalised learn-ing” mustfollowthe evidence on howchildren learn. It mustnotbe an excuse to revive pseudoscientiﬁcideassuch as“learningstyles”: the theorythateach child hasa particularwayoftakingin information. Such nonsense leadsto schemeslike Brain Gym, an “educational kinesiology” programmeonce backed bythe British government, which claimed thatsome pupilsshould stretch, bend and emitan “energyyawn”while doingtheirsums. Alessconsequential falsehood isthattechnologymeanschildren do notneed to learn factsorlearn from a teacher—in-stead theycan justuse Google. Some educationalistsgo fur-ther, arguingthatfactsgetin the wayofskillssuch ascreativityand critical thinking. The opposite istrue. Amemory crammedwith knowledge enablesthese talents. William Shakespearewasdrilled in Latin phrasesand grammatical rulesand yethepenned a fewdecentplays. In 2015 a vaststudyof1,200 educa-tion meta-analysesfound that, ofthe 20 mosteﬀective ways ofboostinglearning, nearlyall relied on the craftofa teacher. The second imperative isto make sure thatedtech narrows,ratherthan widens, inequalitiesin education. Here there aregroundsforoptimism. Some ofthe pioneeringschoolsareprivate onesin Silicon Valley. Butmanymore are run bychar-ter-school groupsteachingmostlypoorpupils, such as Rocket-ship and AchievementFirst—orSummit, where 99% ofgradu-atingpupilsgo on to universityand laggardsmake the mostprogressrelative to theirpeersin normal classes. A similarpat-tern can be observed outside America. In studiesofedtech inIndia byJ-PAL, a research group, the biggestbeneﬁciaries arechildren usingsoftware to receive remedial education. Third, the potential foredtech will be realised only ifteach-ersembrace it. Theyare rightto askforevidence that productswork. Butscepticism should notturn into Luddism. Agoodmodel isSão Paulo, where teachershave welcomed Geekie, anadaptive-software company, into publicschools. In 1984 Skinnercalled opposition to technologythe“shame” ofeducation. Given whatedtech promisestoday,closed-mindednesshasno place in the classroom. 7Brain gainsTogether, technologyand teachers can revamp schoolsLeaders10LeadersThe EconomistJuly22nd2017CRISIS? Whatcrisis? So manyhave been triggered in Brit-ain bythe vote a yearago toleave the European Union that itishard to keep track. Just lastmonth Theresa Maywasre-duced from unassailable ironladyto just-about-managing mi-norityprime minister. Hercabinetisengaged in open warfareasrivalsposition themselvesto replace her. The Labour Party,which hasbeen taken overbya hard-leftadmirerofHugo Chá-vez, isahead in the polls. Meanwhile a neuroticpro-Brexitpressshrieksthatanyone who voicesdoubtsaboutthe coun-try’sdirection isan unpatriotictraitor. Britain ishaving a verypublicnervousbreakdown.The chaosatthe heartofgovernmenthardlybodeswell forthe exitnegotiationswith the EU, which turned to detailedmattersthisweekand need to conclude in autumn 2018. Butthe day-to-daydisordermasksa biggerproblem. Despite thefranticpolitical activityin Westminster—the brieﬁng, back-stabbingand plotting—the countryhasmade remarkably littleprogresssince the referendum in decidingwhatform Brexitshould take. All versions, however“hard” or“soft”, have draw-backs(see page 43). YetBritain’sleadershave scarcelyacknowl-edged thatexitwill involve compromises, letalone how dam-agingtheyare likelyto be. The longertheyfail to face up toBrexit’spainful trade-oﬀs, the more brutal will be the eventualreckoningwith reality.Winging itIn the 13 monthssince the referendum, the awesome complex-ityofendinga 44-yearpolitical and economicunion hasbe-come clear. Britain’sposition on everythingfrom mackerelstocksto nuclearwaste isbeingworked outbya civil servicewhose headcounthasfallen bynearlya quarterin the pastdecade and which hasnotnegotiated a trade deal ofits own inageneration. ResponsibilityforBrexitisshared—or, rather,foughtoverand sometimesdropped—byseveral diﬀerent de-partments. InitiallyBritain’sdecision notto publish a detailednegotiatingposition, asthe EUhad, wasputdown to itsdesireto avoid givingawayitshand. ItnowseemsthatBritain trig-gered exittalksbefore workingoutwhere itstood. The head ofitspublic-spendingwatchdogsaid recentlythatwhen he askedministersfortheirplan he wasgiven only“vague” assurances;he fearsthe whole thingcould fall apart“atthe ﬁrsttap”.Asthe scale ofthe taskhasbecome apparent, so has the dif-ﬁcultyofBritain’sposition. Before the referendum MichaelGove, a leadingBrexiteerin the cabinet, predicted that, “Thedayafterwe vote to leave, we hold all the cards.” Itisnotturn-ingoutlike that. So far, where there hasbeen disagreementBritain hasgiven way. The talkswill be sequenced along thelinessuggested bythe EU. Britain hasconceded thatitwill payan exitbill, contraryto itsforeign secretary’ssuggestion only aweekago thatEurocratscould “go whistle” fortheirmoney.The hobbled MrsMayhasappealed to otherpartiestocome forward with ideason howto make Brexitwork. Labour,which can hardlybelieve thatitiswithin sightofinstalling aradical socialistprime ministerin 10 DowningStreet, isunsur-prisinglymore interested in provokingan election. But cross-partygangsofRemainerMPsare planningto add amend-mentsto legislation, forcingthe governmentto tryto maintainmembership ofEuratom, forinstance, which governsthe tran-sitofradioactive material in Europe. Even within the govern-ment, the prime minister’slackofgrip meansthatcabinet min-istershave started openlydisagreeingaboutwhatshape Brexitshould take. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, hasbeen snipedatbecause he supportsa longtransition period to make Brexitgo smoothly—a sensible idea which isviewed with suspicionbysome Brexiteers, who fearthe transition stage could be-come permanent.The reopeningofthe debate iswelcome, since the hard exitproposed in MrsMay’srejected manifesto would have beenneedlesslydamaging. Butthere isa lackofrealism on all sidesaboutwhatBritain’slimited optionsinvolve. There are manywaysto leave the EU, and none isfree ofproblems. The moreBritain aimsto preserve itseconomicrelationship with thecontinent, the more itwill have to followrulessetby foreignpoliticiansand enforced byforeign judges(including on thesensitive issue offreedom ofmovement). The more control itdemandsoveritsbordersand laws, the harderitwill ﬁnd ittodo businesswith itsbiggestmarket. Itisnotunpatriotic to befrankaboutthese trade-oﬀs. Indeed, itismore unpatriotic tokid votersinto thinkingthatBrexithasno drawbacks atall. The governmenthasnotpublished anyestimatesofthe im-pactofthe varioustypesofBrexitsince the referendum, butacademicstudiessuggestthateven the “softest” option—Nor-wegian-style membership ofthe European EconomicArea—would cuttrade byatleast20%overten years, whereasthe“hardest” exit, revertingto trade on the World Trade Organisa-tion’sterms, would reduce trade by40% and cutannual in-come perperson by2.6%. Asthe economyweakens, these con-cernswill weigh more heavily. Britain’seconomyisgrowingmore slowlythan thatofanyothermemberofthe EU. Theelection showed thatitsvotersare sickofausterity. Ourownpollingﬁndsthat, when forced to choose, a majority nowfa-voursa softBrexit, inside the single market(see page 44).Backin playAfebrile mood in the country, and the powervacuum inDowningStreet, mean thatall optionsare backon the table.Thisispanickingpeople on both sidesofthe debate. Somehardline Brexiteersare agitatingagain forBritain to walkawayfrom the negotiationswith no deal, before votershave achange ofheart. Some Remainersare steppingup calls forasecond referendum, to give the countrya route outof the deep-eningmess. Asthe negotiationsblunderon and the deadlinedrawsnearer, such talkwill become onlymore fevered.So itisall the more crucial thatall sidesface up to the realand painful trade-oﬀsthatBrexitentails. The longer Britainkeepsitshead in the sand, the more likelyitisto end up withno deal, and no preparationsforthe consequences. Thatwould bringa crisisofa neworderofmagnitude. 7Britain and the EUFacingup to BrexitAs long as the governmentstays in denial aboutBrexit’s drawbacks, Britain is on course fordisasterThe EconomistJuly22nd2017 Leaders111ONLYa madman wouldbuild America’shealth-care system from scratch. Its mixofprivate insurance, govern-ment-provided care and endlessregulationsiscomplicated, ex-pensive and failsmanyvulner-able Americans. The AﬀordableCare Act, BarackObama’shealth-care law, ispartofthe mess.Yetthose who passed itknewitwasa grubbycompromise. InAmerica’sdivided government, theyreasoned, politiciansmustbuild on whatalreadyexists.Followingthe travailsthisweekoftheirlatestattempts to“repeal and replace” Obamacare, Republicansmustcome to asimilarrealisation (see page 25). Theyare too divided to sweepawaythe statusquo. Rand Paul, one offoursenatorswhothreatened to bringdown the Senate bill, compared its contin-uation ofpartsofObamacare to “German national socialism”.He wantsto getgovernmentoutofhealth markets. Susan Col-lins, anotherrebel, thinksthe bill cutsMedicaid, government-provided health insurance forthe poor, too deeply. These fac-tionsare unlikelyto agree, howeverlongthe Republican lead-ership triesto ﬁnd a compromise. One conservative gambit—torepeal Obamacare and worryaboutreplacingitlater—is a reck-lessgamble thatwould inﬂictcripplinguncertaintyon thehealth industryand those who relyon it.Getoverthe nameRepublicanshave longspoken asifObamacare isa burninghouse; those inside mustbe rescued, even ifitmeans takinganaxe to the walls. Butitisa fallaciousargumentdesigned to pro-vide political coverto a Senate bill thatismore about reducingredistribution than rescuingObamacare’scustomersfrom di-saster(see page 26). The law’sproblemsare real, butﬁxable—more like a leakyroofand botched plumbingthan a ﬁre. Theholescan still be patched up, in three steps.First, more statesshould emulate Alaska, Minnesota andOregon, and startreinsurance programmesto paythe highestmedical costsincurred on Obamacare’sinsurance exchanges.Because the lawforbidsdiscrimination againstthose with pre-existinghealth conditions, the exchangescontain many sicklypatients. Asa result, premiumsand deductibleshave soaredforthe 9m buyerswho earn too much to receive governmentsubsidies. Theyfootmuch ofthe bill forObamacare’sgeneros-ity. Meanwhile, 155m otherAmericansenjoya taxbreakon theplanstheygetfrom theiremployers, which are often cheaperanyway. Reinsurance programmeswould bringpremiumsdown and begin to redressthe imbalance.

Butthe general trajectoryhasseemed plain enough: towards agreaterrole formarketforces.Since the early1980s, privatebusinesshasgrown farfasterand been much more proﬁtable than the state sector. Back thenstate companieswere responsible forroughlyfour-ﬁfths ofoutput; nowtheyaccountforlessthan a ﬁfth.PresidentXi Jinping’scommitmentin 2013 to give marketforces“a decisive role” in allocatingresourcesseemed to pre-sage more ofthe same. Yetthe retreatofstate-owned enter-prises(SOEs) hasstalled, and in some respectsgone into re-verse. China still hasmore than 150,000 SOEs. Theirshare ofindustrial assetshoversstubbornlynear40%. Theyaccountforabouthalfofbankcredit, and when the economyslows thestate pressesthem to spend more. Since 2015 investmentbySOEshasoutpaced thatbyprivate ﬁrms(see page 55).MrXi remainswell aware ofthe need forreform; on July15th he repeated warningsaboutindebtednessatSOEs. Butonlysome ofthe initiativesrolled outon hiswatch are aimedatslimmingthe state sector. Two ofthem pointin another dir-ection entirely. One isthe mergingofcompetingSOEs.

Provincialgovernmentshave published plansto push fundsinto areassuch asbiotechnologyand cloud computing. The entrenchmentofstate ﬁrmsbringsdangersboth forChina and forthe widerworld. Domestically, evidence showsthatSOEsunderperform private businesses. Abiggerrole forthem will mean more ineﬃciencyand slowergrowth over thelongterm. State enterprisesare also a principal culprit in thealarmingbuild-up ofcorporate debtin China (nearly170% ofGDPatthe end oflastyear). The IMFestimatesthatreform ofSOEscould bringa $1trn economicdividend overthe course ofadecade. Theirpersistence will impose concomitantcosts.SOEsalso riskprovokinga backlash astheytarget increasedforeign sales.

MrXi does notwantto change thatrecipe. Buthe isdoingsomething moreradical: reversingthe state’sretreatfrom the economy. 7NO ONE batted an eyelid ear-lierthisyearwhen Turk-menistan’sstrongman, Gurban-gulyBerdimuhamedov, was“re-elected” with nearly98% ofthe vote. Why, one wonders, didhe botherwith an election at all?Yetin a growingnumberoffrag-ile newdemocracies, especiallyin Africa, where similarly ab-surd resultswere once common, electionshave become genu-ine. Since 1991incumbentgovernmentsorleadershave beenousted atthe ballotboxatleast45 times, mostrecentlyin Ni-geria, Ghana, the Gambia and Lesotho. Nervesstill jangle atelection time, especiallywhen the out-come islikelyto be close, patronage and corruption are perva-sive, and riggingand violence have blighted previous ballots.Afraudulentelection can tarnish a country’sreputation,threaten itsstability, and deterinvestmentand aid. Kenya, whose votersgo to the pollson August8th, isjustsuch a case. Violence afteran election in 2007 leftatleast1,300dead and 700,000 displaced. The countryisthe economic andstrategichub ofeastAfrica, so a credible election this time mat-tersnotonlyto Kenyansbutto manybeyond theirborders. For-eign and local observerswill be vital to ensuringa clean con-testin such a “transitional democracy” (see page 47).Beatthe cheatIn the bad old daysno one (exceptthe haplesscitizens ofthecountriesconcerned) seemed to care much ifelections wererigged, provided theywere more orlesspeaceful. Internation-al monitorswould swan in a fewdaysbefore the poll and—more negligently—ﬂyoutagain a dayortwo afterit, often de-claringthe election to have been “free and fair” because theyhad seen voterscasttheirballotswithoutviolence. No matterthatfraud and bad blood often increase afterpolling day. The likesofRobertMugabe in Zimbabwe prefermonitorsfrom the African Union, who in the pasthave endorsed sus-pectresults(theyhave recentlybecome a bitmore rigorous).More ambitiousplaces, such asKenya and Ghana, crave theimprimaturofthe European Union and respected Americanoutﬁts, notablythe National DemocraticInstitute, the Interna-tional Republican Institute and the CarterCentre. Nowadaysforeign monitoringteamsstartto arrive a goodmonth before the bigdayand stayforatleasta month afterit.The outsidershelp in several ways. Theyprovide expertise ontechnology, especiallyconcerningthe registration of votersand the method ofvote-counting.Monitorsalso help co-ordi-nate “parallel vote tabulation”, wherebysamplesofthe resultsfrom randomlyselected pollingstationsare collected and pre-sented quicklyto preventfraud in the latercounting process.Crucially, foreign monitorssupportlocal watchdogswho domostofthe workand face the greatestrisks.Foreignersalone cannotensure fairelections. They relyonthe co-operation oflocal governments, to gain access to the en-tire process, includingthe voters’ register. Buttheycan raise thebaragainstrigging.

Both, itseems, getmore productive. Formanyde-cadeseducational innovatorshave happi-lyanticipated the end of“factorymodel”,wherebychildren ofthe same age learnfrom the same teacherin broadlythe sameway, yetthe model endures. Now, atleastin some places, itsdaysseem numbered. Investors, both philanthropicand oth-erwise, are excited.

Itcomparedtestresultsofpupilsat62 such schoolswiththose ofsimilarpupilsatordinaryschools.The formermade greaterprogress, espe-ciallythose who started nearthe bottomofthe class.

The results arefrom earlyadoptersofthe model, withhighlymotivated teachers. And the RANDresearcherswere notable to workout whatitwasschoolswere doingto gain their re-sults. Withoutthatunderstandingexpand-ingthe model will be tricky. AfurtherRANDreport, released on July11th, reiterat-ed these concerns.Teachersmaybe more sceptical awayfrom Silicon Valley.

She remains under housearrest—guilty by association. In a letter to her from his deathbed, Mr Liu praised her“calmness that confronts suﬀering”. Tributes to him could only be oblique. Tens ofthousands shared online a Taiwanese pop song. Its ﬁrst verse runs: “You disappearedfrom the far end of the sea….

Even so, a Re-publican senatorclaimed to knowoftenDemocraticsenatorsreadyto deal, and thefactthatten Democratsare up forre-elec-tion nextyearin statesthatvoted for MrTrump, includingIndiana and WestVirgin-ia, makesthatplausible.YetMrMcConnell, though notopposedto a bipartisan ﬁx, mayhave more pressingconcerns. He hasalwaysseemed lessinter-ested in health-care reform than in the ﬁl-lip scrappingObamacare mightprovideforthe widerconservative agenda—espe-ciallyitscherished taxcuts, part-funded bythe $772bn MrMcConnell hoped to cutfrom Medicaid.

ButSenate Republicans’ own propos-als, contained in two draftbillshatched,with tellingsecrecy, byMitch McConnell,the Republican leader, were little better.Accordingto the Congressional BudgetOﬃce (CBO), the second iteration, whichstalled on July17th, would have resulted in22m fewerinsured within a decade. Bothbillswere wildlyunpopular—only17% ap-proved ofthe second. Theywere opposedbyboth moderate Republicans, led bySu-san CollinsofMaine, and conservatives,led byRand Paul ofKentucky.

MrMcConnell’sauthority, which islargelybased on hisreputation forskilful deal-making, hasbeen damaged.Whateverhe decides, supportfrom MrTrump, whose standingwith hisRepubli-can colleaguesiseven more diminished,will be ﬁckle. Havingpromised two yearsago to replace Obamacare with “some-thingterriﬁc”, MrTrump appearsto havemade little progressin workingoutthe de-tails.

The likeliestoutcome remainsa temporarypersonal in-come-taxcutand a reduction in corporaterates(though probablynotto the 15% levelthe White House wants).Naturally, MrTrump, who recentlyclaimed to have “passed more legislation”than anyofhispredecessors, though hehasin factsigned nota single bill of note,doesnotacknowledge hisfailure. “I thinkwe’re probablyin thatposition wherewe’ll letObamacare fail,” he said. “We’renotgoingto own it. I’m notgoingto own it.Ican tell youthe Republicansare not goingto own it.” In facttheydo own itand, giventhe alternative plansMrMcConnell had inmind, thatisprobablya good thingfor hisparty. With an approval ratingofover 50%,Obamacare isconsiderablymore popularthan the Republicans. Astheycontemplatethislatesttrauma—the rejection byvotersand collapse ofa health-care reform thatwasforyearstheirmostferventambition—Republicans, omnipotentbutunloved,need to reﬂecton whythatis.7REPUBLICANSpresented theireﬀorts tooverhaul the Aﬀordable Care Act,which ﬂopped thisweek, asa necessary re-sponse to a failinglaw. Theyfrequently saythe individual market, in which those whodo notgethealth insurance through theiremployerscan buyitforthemselves, is col-lapsing. Premiumsrose byan average of22% in 2017. So manyinsurershave givenup on the marketthatabouta third ofcountieshave onlyone left; 38 are atrisk ofhavingno insurerfor2018, accordingto theKaiserFamilyFoundation, a think-tank. Yetthe Republican bill isnota technocratic ﬁxforthese problems. Rather, itisan attemptto enforce conservative thinkingon healthcare. And itisfailingpartlybecause ofideo-logical faultlinesin the party.To see this, startwith the factthat thebill makesthe individual marketweaker,notstronger. Itabolishesthe individualmandate—the requirementthateveryonewho can aﬀord insurance mustbuyit—andmakessubsidiesforlow- and middle-in-come buyerslessgenerous. The Congres-sional BudgetOﬃce (CBO) forecastthat theﬁrstversion ofthe Senate’sbill would havereduced enrolmentin the individual mar-ketin 2018 byovera third—a more dramaticcollapse than anythingseen to date. Next, considerthe changesto the billmade bySenatorTed CruzofTexas. His“ConsumerFreedom Option” would al-lowinsurersto sell almostcompletely de-regulated plans, so longastheycontinue tooﬀersome thatfollowed Obamacare’srules. Thisisan attackon the redistributioninherentin the law. Byforcingall plans tocovercertain things—such astreatment formental health—Obamacare ensuresthatthose who fall victim to such conditions, orwho alreadyhave them, paythe same forinsurance aseverybodyelse. Theirmedi-cal costsare spread around.MrCruzseesthisasan unwarranted in-cursion into consumers’ freedom ofchoice. Hisamendmentwould lead manyhealthypeople to buycheap planscover-inglittle. Iftheythen contracted a condi-tion which theirplan did notcover, theywould have to waitsixmonthsbefore re-turningto the Obamacare exchange. Be-cause the exchange would contain mostlysicklypeople, premiumswould rocket. Theplan isakin to allowingconsumersto buycheapercarswithoutseatbelts, with theadded side-eﬀectofpushingthe price ofcarsthatkeep them much higher.Some redistribution would live on.Poorbuyerswould still have theirpremi-umscapped. And the bill stumpsup$182bn overa decade which statescoulduse to subsidise the exchanges. Butthisvexespurists. Rand Paul, one ofthe foursenatorswho isstandingin the wayof thebill’sprogress, describesitasa “giantinsur-ance bail-outsuperfund”.The problem isthatconservatives aredivided overwhetherthe governmenthasanybusinessatall in health-care markets.All agree thatObamacare’shigh premiumsare a problem. Theyfall on a small numberofbuyerswho earn too much to qualify fortheirsubsidies. Manyofthem are self-em-ployed and therefore partofa keyRepubli-can constituency. The 155m Americanswho getinsurance from theiremployersdo nothave to bearthe same costs. But thequestion is: who should? The rightof theparty’sansweristhatthe sickpeople mustpayforthemselves. MrPaul sayshealthcare isa “marketitem” thatshould notbesubsidised. ButmostRepublican plans,like the Senate bill, steersome taxpayercash towardsthe 20% ofAmericanswhoincur82% ofhealth costs.Changesto redistribution in the indi-vidual marketare somewhathidden. Butthe bill’scutsto Medicaid, health insur-ance forthe poor, are in plain sight. TheCBO thinkstheywould leave 15m fewerpeople enrolled in Medicaid than wouldbe underthe currentlawby2026. Republi-cansﬁnd these cutshard to defend, oftendenyingtheyexist. Susan Collins, anotherRepublican rebel in the Senate, thinks theyare too deep—the polaropposite ofMrPaul’sobjection. MostAmericansworryaboutincreased governmentspendingbutneverthelessthinkthe governmentshouldensure everyone hashealth insurance. Re-publicansare divided and confused overthe extentto which theyagree. 7Republican ideasRe-redistributeWASHINGTON, DCThe ideologybehind the Republicans’health-care billOath keepers in the SenateThe EconomistJuly22nd2017 UnitedStates271“SPRECHENSie Deutsch?” asksKrisKo-bach.

Though once embraced byRonald Reagan, George H.W. Bush andGeorge W. Bush, cap-and-trade schemeshave come to be seen byRepublicansas ex-emplifyinggovernmentoverreach. On theotherhand, agricultural businessownersin MrMathis’sdistrictﬂooded him withlettersin supportofcap-and-trade, whichtheythoughtwould be betterthan thestate’salternative plansforreducingCO2emissions. MrMathiswasso torn aboutthe choice he soughtouthispastorto prayaboutit. On July17th when the vote washeld, he opted to supportthe extension. Cap-and-trade programmesworkbysettinga limit(orcap) on howmuch CO2individual companiescan emit. Business-esthatpollute lessthan the cap can sell (ortrade) theirexcessallowance to those thatpollute more. The rootsofCalifornia’sscheme, which isthe world’sthird largestafterthe European Union’sand South Ko-rea’s, go backto 2006, when AssemblyBill32 (AB32) waspassed. In thatmeasure, leg-islatorscommitted to cuttingCalifornia’sgreenhouse-gasemissionsto 1990 levelsby2020—a reduction ofroughly30%, to 431mmetrictonnesofemissions. To meetthatgoal, the state’sAirResourcesBoard (ARB)pushed a numberofinitiativesthatinclud-ed a cap-and-trade programme, which itimplemented in early2013. Since itisrelativelynew, distinguishingthe impactofCalifornia’scap-and-tradeprogramme from itsotherinitiativesongreenhouse gasesisdiﬃcult. Californiaalso hasa LowCarbon Fuel Standard,which requirespetroleum producersto re-duce the share ofCO2in theirfuels, and anAdvanced Clean CarsProgramme, a pack-age ofregulationsto reduce pollution fromcars. The Environmental Defence Fund, acharity, estimated in 2011thatcap-and-trade would accountfor20% ofthe pollu-tion cutsrequired byAB32. Altogether, the state ismakingprogress.State-wide emissionspeaked in 2004 andhave since declined by10%. The ARBfoundthatgreenhouse-gasemissionsfell by 1.5mmetrictonnesbetween 2014 and 2015,which isequivalentto removing300,000vehiclesfrom California’s(often congest-ed) roadsfora year. Lastyearthe Democratic-dominatedlegislature seta more demandingemis-sionsreduction target: 40% below1990 lev-elsby2030. Cap-and-trade isseen asthekeyto reachingthat, butbefore this week’svote itsfuture wasuncertain. Overthe pastfouryearsthe ARBhasfaced several law-suitsovercap-and-trade. Plaintiﬀsin thesuitsargue the system functionsasa tax.Since itwasnotapproved bytwo-thirds ofthe state legislature—the legal threshold forcreatingnewtaxesin California—theyclaim itisunconstitutional. California’sstate governmenthasso farprevailed in court. Butto quash such dis-putesforgood JerryBrown, California’sgovernor, needed to convince a superma-jorityoflegislators(two-thirds) to extendcap-and-trade to 2030. In the run up to thevote, MrBrown gave a typicallyBrownianspeech to a state Senate committee: “Whatam I? 79? Do I have ﬁve yearsmore?” heshouted. “Thisisn’tforme. I’m gonna bedead. It’sforyouand it’sdamn real.”MrMathiswasone ofeightRepublicanstate legislatorsto supportthe cap-and-trade extension, givingthe measure itstwo-thirdsmajority. Such bipartisan col-laborationsare rare—especiallyon climate-change, overwhich the electorate isstarklydivided. Asurveypublished byPewRe-search Centre in October2016 suggestedthatonly18% ofconservative Republicansbelieve climate scientistsunderstand“verywell” whetherclimate change isoc-curring, compared with 68% ofliberalDemocrats. While these divisionspersistin the Golden State, there isbroader sup-portoverall forclimate policies, says MarkBaldassare, the presidentofthe Public Poli-cyInstitute ofCalifornia, a think-tank.When he polled Californiansin July2016,81% ofadultssawglobal warmingasa“very” or“somewhat” seriousthreatto thestate’seconomyand qualityoflife. 7CaliforniaParis-on-seaLOS ANGELESThe Golden State pushes on with plansto reduce greenhouse-gas emissionsLA’s trading ﬂoorThe EconomistJuly22nd2017 UnitedStates29“ILITERALLYwenthome everynightforthe ﬁrstthree monthsand said,“Oh, myGod, whathave I gotten myselfinto?’,” Boston’smayor, MartyWalsh, re-centlytold the Boston Globe.

On July17th, in a let-terto Congress, the United Statestrade rep-resentative, RobertLighthizer, made theadministration’sintentionsclearer. Theyare closerto revision than destruction,which isa reliefforMexico and Canada,the United States’ NAFTApartners. Butalongside conventional-soundingnegoti-atingobjectivesare ﬂashesofTrumpian ag-gression and hintsthatthe United Stateswill demand painful changesto the deal. The stakesare high.

FearsthattheUnited Stateswould abandon NAFTAhavecaused volatilityin the marketsfortheMexican peso and Canadian dollar, andtalkofpossible recessions. MrLighthizer’sletter, published atthestartofwhatMrTrump billed as“made inAmerica” week, calmed those fears. Theadministration hasbeen tamed bywork-ingthrough Congress.

In otherwords, publicdebtisrising. Manygovern-mentshave started to retrench. Feware in aposition to prime the pump ofrecovery.There isa second factorslowingthe re-bound: political uncertainty. Thatstartswith Donald Trump. While he hasagreedto renegotiate, ratherthan scrap, the NorthAmerican Free-Trade AgreementwithMexico and Canada, he continuestothreaten to impose protectionistmea-sures, discourage investmentsouth of theRio Grande and deportmillionsofMexi-cansand Central Americans. So farMexi-co’seconomyhasheld up betterthanfeared: the peso isstrongernowthan itwasbefore MrTrump’selection lastNo-vember. The annual growth ratewas2.7%in the ﬁrstquarterofthisyear. But Mexicoislivingfrom month to month.The second doubtconcernsdomesticpolitics. Latin America will notreturn tofastergrowth unlessitdoesmore to solvethe structural problemsthathold it back.Theyinclude inadequate infrastructure,poor-qualityschooling, badlydesignedtaxesand regulationsthathobble busi-ness.

Butin the largercountries, theonlypresidentwho iseven moderatelypopularisMauricio Macri ofArgentina.In Brazil, Michel Temerhasan approvalratingof7% and maybe evicted from of-ﬁce because ofcorruption allegations.Between NovemberofthisyearandOctober2018, Chile, Colombia, Mexicoand Brazil all face presidential elections(while Argentina hasan importantmid-term congressional election thisOctober).These contestswill take place amid popu-lardisillusion with politicians, causedpartlybycorruption.

Negotiationson a free-trade agreementbetween Cana-da and the United States, which came be-fore NAFTA, nearlybroke down in 1987 be-cause the United Statesrefused torelinquish the option to impose retaliatoryduties.

But until re-centlytheywere often rounded up bypo-lice and deported backto Venezuela by thebusload.

A studybyAidData, a projectbased atthe CollegeofWilliam and Maryin Virginia, foundthatcountriesthatvote with China in theUN General Assemblygetconsiderablymore moneythan those thatdo not.China hasalso spread itsinﬂuence inlessvisible ways. Victoria Breeze and Na-than Moore atMichigan State Universityreckon thatin 2014 the numberofAfricanstudentsin China surpassed the numberstudyingin eitherBritain orAmerica, thetraditional destinationsforEnglish-speak-ers(France still beatsall three, however).Much ofthe growth isbecause China hasgiven tensofthousandsofscholarships toAfrican students, the academicssay.

In the pastdecade,Chinese loansand contractorshave, quiteliterally, reshaped much ofthe continent’sinfrastructure, payingforand buildingnewports, roadsand railways.

In a recentreportMcKinsey, a consultingﬁrm, looked at ﬁvemeasuresofAfrica’seconomicconnectionwith the world: trade, investmentstock, in-vestmentgrowth, infrastructure ﬁnancingand aid. Itfound thatChina isamong thetop fourpartnersin each ofthese. “No oth-ercountrymatchesthisdepth and breadthofengagement,” itenthused. Yetothersare more sceptical, arguingthatmanyoverestimate the sumsthatChi-na isinvestingin orlendingto Africa, be-cause theyadd up pledgesratherthan ac-tual ﬂows. Aclose parsingofthe data byDavid Dollar, an economist, ﬁndsthat Chi-na accountsforonlyabout5% ofall exist-inginvestmentin Africa, and a similarshare ofnewinvestments. America’sin-vestmentstockistwice asmuch.“The notion thatChina hasprovided anoverwhelmingamountofﬁnance and isbuyingup the whole continentisinaccu-rate,” he argues.

She found thatlittle morethan halfofannounced Chinese loanstoAfrica actuallymaterialised. Yetlookbeyond oﬃcial loansor theworkofbigChinese state-owned compa-nies, and there are signsofa deeper Chi-nese involvement.

Hissing cousins

Three score and ten years after their acr imonious split, India and
Pakistan remain at daggers drawn. Max Rodenbeck asks if they can
ever make up 

EVERY AFTERNOON AT sunset, at a point midway along the arrow-
straight road between Amritsar and Lahore, rival squads of splendidly
uniformed soldiers strut and stomp a 17th-century British military drill
known as Beating Retreat (pictured). Barked commands, ﬁerce glares and
preposterously high kicks all signal violent intent. But then, lovingly and
in unison, the enemies lower their national ﬂags. Opposing guardsmen
curtly shake hands, and the border gates roll shut for the night.
As India and Pakistan celebrate their twin 70th birthday this Au-
gust, the frontier post of Wagah reﬂects the profound dysfunction in their
relations. On its side Pakistan has built a multi-tiered amphitheatre for
the boisterous crowds that come to watch the show. The Indians, no less
rowdy, have gone one better with
a half-stadium for 15,000. But the
number of travellers who actually
cross the border here rarely ex-
ceeds a few hundred a week.
Wagah’s
silly hats and
walks serve a serious function.
The cuckoo-clock regularity of
the show; the choreographed
complicity between 
the 
two
sides; and the fact that the sol-
diers and crowds look, act and
talk very much the same—all this
has the reassuring feel of a sport-
ing rivalry between teams. No
matter how bad things get be-
tween us, the ritual seems to say,
we know it is just a game. Alas,
the game between India and
Pakistan has often turned serious. 
After the exhaustion of the
second world war Britain was
faced with two claimants to its
restless Indian empire, a huge
masala of ethnic, linguistic and
religious groups (half of which was administered directly and half as
“princely states” under 565 hereditary rulers subject to the British crown).
Just about everyone wanted independence. But whereas the Congress
Party of Mahatma Gandhi envisioned a uniﬁed federal state, the Muslim
League of Muhammad Ali Jinnah argued that the subcontinent’s 30%
Muslim minority constituted a separate nation that risked oppression
under a Hindu majority. Communal riots prompted Britain’s last viceroy,
Lord Mountbatten, to make a hasty decision. He split the country in
two—or rather three, since the new state of Pakistan came in two parts, di-
vided by the 2,000km (1,240-mile) expanse of the new state of India. 
When the two new states were proclaimed in mid-August 1947, it
was hoped the partition would be orderly. Lines had been drawn on
maps, and detailed lists of personnel and assets, down to the instru-
ments in army bands, had been assigned to each side. But the plans im-
mediately went awry in a vast, messy and violent exchange of popula-
tions that left at least 1m dead and 15m uprooted from their homes. 
Within months a more formal war had erupted. It ended by tearing
the former princely state of Kashmir in two, making its 750km-long por-
tion of the border a perpetual subject of dispute. Twice more, in 1965 and

Missing map? Sadly, India censors 
maps that show the current ef fective

It is more intolerant on this issue 
than either China or Pakistan. Indian 
readers will therefore probably be 
depr ived of the maps on the second

1971, India and Pakistan fought full-blown if mercifully brief
wars. The second of those, with India supporting a guerrilla in-
surgency in the Bengali-speaking extremity of East Pakistan, gave
rise to yet another proud new country, Bangladesh; but not be-
fore at least half a million civilians had died as West Pakistan bru-
tally tried to put down the revolt.
Even periods of relative peace have not been especially
peaceful. In the 1990s Pakistan backed a guerrilla insurgency in
Indian Kashmir in which at least 40,000 people lost their lives. In
1999 Pakistani troops captured some mountain peaks in the Kar-
gil region, which India clawed back in high-altitude battles. A
ceaseﬁre in Kashmir that has held since 2003 has not stopped
Pakistan-sponsored groups from striking repeatedly inside India.
Pakistan claims that India, too, has covertly sponsored subver-
sive groups. 
Analysts discern a pattern in this mutual harassment:
whenever politicians on both sides inch towards peace, some-
thing nasty seems to happen. Typically, these cycles start with an
attack on Indian soldiers in Kashmir by inﬁltrators from Pakistan,
triggering Indian artillery strikes, which prod the Pakistanis to re-
spond in kind. After a few weeks things will calm down.
Just such a cycle started in late 2015, prompted, perhaps, by
a surprise visit to the home of the Pakistani prime minister, Na-
waz Sharif, by his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi. Hopes
raised by this overture dimmed within days when jihadist inﬁl-
trators attacked an Indian airbase. Another suicide squad struck
an Indian army camp near the border, killing 19 soldiers. Faced
with public outrage, Mr Modi ordered a far harder response than
usual, sending commando teams into Pakistan. In the past, India
had kept quiet even when it hit back, leaving room for Pakistan to
climb down. This time Mr Modi’s government moved to isolate
Pakistan diplomatically, rebuﬀed behind-the-scenes eﬀorts to
calm tensions and sent unprovoked blasts of ﬁre across the Kash-
mir border. 

India’s loss of patience is under-
standable. It has a population six times
Pakistan’s and an economy eight times as
big, yet it ﬁnds itself being provoked far
more often than it does the provoking.
When Mr Modi’s Hindu-nationalist Bha-
ratiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in
2014, it promised to put muscle into In-
dia’s traditionally limp foreign policy. “In-
dia for the ﬁrst time is being proactive, not
just responding,” says Sushant Singh, a
military historian and journalist. “This is
a huge shift.”
Yet Mr Modi’s pugnacity raises the
risk of a dangerous escalation. “After a
routine operation, the adversary may or
may not escalate; after a publicised opera-
tion he will have only one option: to esca-
late,” writes Pratap Bhanu Mehta, one of
India’s more thoughtful intellectuals.
Whether India and Pakistan are
reckless enough to come to serious blows
would not matter so much if they simply
ﬁelded conventional armies. But they are
equipped with more than 100 nuclear
warheads apiece, along with the missiles
to deliver them. Since both countries re-
vealed their nuclear hands in the 1990s,
optimists who thought that a “balance of
terror” would encourage them to be more
moderate have been proved only partial-
ly right. Indians complain of being blackmailed: Pakistan knows
that the risk of nuclear escalation stops its neighbours from re-
sponding more robustly to its provocations. Worryingly, Pakistan
also rejects the nuclear doctrine of no ﬁrst use. Instead, it has
moved to deploy less powerful nuclear warheads as battleﬁeld
weapons, despite the risk that fallout from their use might harm
its own civilians.
India does espouse a no-ﬁrst-use nuclear doctrine, but its
military planning is said to include a scenario of a massive con-
ventional blitzkrieg aimed at seizing chunks of enemy territory
and crushing Pakistan’s oﬀensive capacity before it can respond.
India’s arsenal includes the hypersonic Brahmos III, the world’s
fastest cruise missile, which can precisely deliver a 300kg pay-
load to any target in Pakistan. An air-launched version could
reach Islamabad in two minutes, and Lahore in less than one.
And in a grim calculation, India, with four times Pakistan’s terri-

tory, sees itself as better able to absorb a nuclear strike. 
Alarmists will probably be proved wrong. Both countries
are prone to sabre-rattling theatrics, but they are well aware that
the price of full-blown war would be appalling. And despite the
uncertainties generated by the rise of China, the continuing trou-
bles in Afghanistan and the incalculability of Donald Trump’s
America, the international community still seems likely to be
able to pull Pakistan and India apart if need be. 
As this special report will argue, though, both Pakistan and
India should more openly acknowledge the costs, to themselves
and to the wider region, of their seven decades of bitter separa-
tion. These include not only what they have had to spend, in
lives and treasure, on waging war and maintaining military
readiness over generations, but the immense opportunity cost of
forgoing fruitful exchanges between parts of the same subconti-
nental space that in the past have always been open to each oth-
er. Trade between the two rivals adds up to barely $2.5bn a year.
Perpetual enmity has also distorted internal politics, espe-
cially in Pakistan, where overweening generals have repeatedly
sabotaged democracy in the name of national security. Pakistan
has suﬀered culturally, too; barred from its natural subcontinen-
tal hinterland, it has opened instead to the Arab world, and to the
inﬂuence of less syncretic and tolerant forms of Islam. For India,
enmity with Pakistan has fostered a tilt away from secular values
towards a more strident identity politics. 
Reﬂexive fear of India prompts Pakistan’s generals to med-
dle in Afghanistan, which they see as a strategic backyard where
no foreign power can be allowed to linger. In turn, India, because
of the constant aggravation from Pakistan, has become bad-tem-
pered with its smaller neighbours. Small wonder that intra-re-
gional trade makes up barely 5% of the subcontinent’s overall
trade, compared with more than a quarter in South-East Asia.
And it is no surprise that Pakistan has opened its arms to China,
which is oﬀering ﬁnance, trade and superpower patronage.
This special report will seek to unravel the causes of this ir-
rational enmity, and to explore the contrasting internal dynam-
ics in both countries that sustain it. It will examine new factors in
this complex geopolitical board game, such as the rise of China.
And it will consider what might be done to nudge the two rivals
away from the vicious circle that binds them. 7

Unhappy together, unhappy apart

YOUNGER INDIANS AND Pakistanis tend to assume their
countries were born enemies. Only the old recall that until
their teenage years they were quite friendly. Ties of kinship were
strong. India and Pakistan had inherited the same laws and insti-
tutions, and both were poor, multilingual and multi-ethnic.
Their elites shared similar aspirations and spoke the same lan-
guage, English, in addition to others that spanned the border,
such as Urdu and Punjabi. 
Pakistan’s gaunt, chain-smoking founding father, Muham-
mad Ali Jinnah, insisted that Muslims constitute a separate na-
tion, but envisioned a secular state. He was no Sunni majoritar-
ian. The Jinnah family were Ismailis, a subsect of Islam’s smaller
Shia branch. His foreign minister was an Ahmadi, another small

sect that some Muslims regard as heretical. His law minister was
a Hindu, and both his second wife and his personal doctor were
Zoroastrians. Jinnah owned a luxurious mansion in Bombay,
where he spent most of his youth and career. 
In the 1950s India and Pakistan amicably settled the tricky
problem of properties abandoned by millions of refugees. In
1960 they signed a complex deal to share the waters of the Indus
river, Pakistan’s lifeline; it has stuck ever since. Pakistan’s nation-
al cricket team toured India in 1952 and 1960-61; the Indian one
went to Pakistan in 1954-55. Until 1965 citizens of either country
who wanted to visit the other could get visas on arrival. 
There are many reasons why the ungainly twins drifted
apart. In the initial division of spoils, India got more of the mon-
ey. It also got land that Pakistan laid claim to. The big, rich prince-
ly state of Hyderabad and the tiny one of Junagadh had Muslim
rulers but mostly Hindu subjects, and they were a long way from
the rest of Pakistan, so India annexed them. Jammu and Kashmir
presented the opposite problem: a Hindu ruler with mostly Mus-
lim subjects. In late 1947 Pakistan sent guerrilla ﬁghters to stir a
Muslim uprising. The Maharaja invited Indian troops who eject-
ed the intruders. The territory has been a bone of contention
ever since (see box, next page). 
As the two countries matured, their political systems di-
verged. “They got the generals, we got the bureaucrats,” is how
Indian wits put it. With a single brief interruption, India has sus-
tained a noisy, wobbly and messy democracy. Its elected leaders,
backed up by a powerful civil service and buﬀered by the sheer
size and diversity of the country, have kept the army in check.
Not so Pakistan.
The British Raj recruited hardest among the supposedly
“martial races” of northern India, and deployed soldiers most
heavily on the troubled Afghan frontier. So Pakistan, with a ﬁfth
of India’s population at partition, inherited 30% of the Indian
army, 40% of the navy and 20% of the air force. Military spending
ate up three-quarters of Pakistan’s ﬁrst budget in 1948, notes Hu-
sain Haqqani, a Pakistani diplomat and author. The share has
dropped, but Pakistan still has an oversized, pampered army.
Split in two, with the bulk of India in the middle, in the
1950s the country felt vulnerable. It was not surprising that Paki-

2 stan should fall into the cold-war embrace of America, which
showered it with surplus weaponry from the Korean war. But
the bonanza made the generals overconﬁdent. In 1958 they top-
pled the civilian government. They began to dream of gaining
full strategic parity with their much larger neighbour, but they
lacked public backing for bigger spending and indeﬁnite military
rule. This they achieved by setting up India as a threat to the na-
tion. In 1965 Pakistan again sent guerrillas into Kashmir. India
struck back across the international border farther south. After
some weeks of ﬁghting both countries signed a truce. Pakistan
gained nothing, but its army had proved that India was indeed
an existential danger.
Five years later East Pakistan was growing restless. As a
small guerrilla campaign grew in strength, with covert Indian
help, Pakistan’s army launched a counter-insurgency so brutal
and indiscriminate that it provoked a far bigger uprising. India
formally entered the conﬂict in December 1971. In just 13 days its
army, with the Bengali rebels, defeated Pakistan and took 90,000
prisoners. Bangladesh had won its independence. 
The Bangladesh debacle carried the disgraced Pakistani

army out of power, but only until the next military coup, in 1977.
For his ﬁrst two years in power General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq
remained an international outcast. But when Russia invaded Af-
ghanistan at the end of 1979, Pakistan gained an avalanche of aid
from America and its allies, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
General Zia tilted Pakistan sharply away from Jinnah’s
dreamy secularism. Yet in many ways his embrace of conserva-
tive Sunni orthodoxy reﬂected tensions inherent in Pakistan’s
“Islamic” identity. Even before he imposed a panoply of sharia
punishments, Pakistan was renamed as an Islamic Republic in
1956, the Ahmadi minority was oﬃcially branded as non-Mus-
lims in 1974, and alcohol was banned in 1977. 
General Zia died in a mysterious plane crash in 1988, the
year the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan. But although
Pakistan nominally returned to civilian rule, there was no real
oversight over the sprawling military establishment. The army’s
inﬂuence and the tentacles of the intelligence apparatus reached
into the press, the courts, universities and private business. Bol-
stered by continued American support, the Pakistani army has
been free to indulge its obsession with India ever since. 7

Vale of darkness

Kashmir is trapped in a tragic cycle

LOUIS JOXE, THE French statesman who
signed the peace agreement ending Alger ia’s
bloody war of independence, later reﬂected
that it was the magniﬁcence of the country’s
landscape that intoxicated France. “It went
to our heads,” he said. Kashmir has a similar
eﬀect. Juxtaposed with the torr id ﬂatness of
the vast nor th Indian plain, its cool green
highlands exer t a magical pull. “We are
twisted and coated in this beastly beauty,”
laments Aijaz Hussain, a gr izzled journalist in
Sr inagar. “In a way it holds us hostage.”
History has not been kind to Kashmir.
In 1846, af ter the Br itish had defeated the
Sikh empire that then ruled the Indian nor th,
a vast chunk of it was sold to the Dogra family
for 7.5m rupees. So was born the pr incely
state of Jammu and Kashmir. One of the
many odd satrapies under the Br itish Raj, its
rulers were Hindu but their subjects mostly
Muslim, par ticularly in the Vale of Kashmir.
This was the jewel in the turban: a r ich,
well-watered upland plateau the size of a
large English county whose people spoke
their own language, Koshur. 
At par tition a century later, both new
countr ies staked a claim to the state. Its
maharaja dithered, toying with indepen-
dence. Pakistan pre-empted him by sending
armed “volunteers” to foment an upr ising,
for surely his Muslim subjects longed to join
their new motherland. In lowland Jammu
some Muslim-major ity areas joined Pakistan,
and tens of thousands of Muslims ﬂed there.
But the Vale did not r ise up, even when the
maharaja signed away his inher itance,

inviting India to oust the invaders. 
The br ief war that followed lef t Paki-
stan with a slice of Jammu and a sliver of
Kashmir, along with Gilgit-Baltistan, a vast
tract of spectacular mountains. India kept
the mostly Hindu rest of Jammu, the Vale
itself and the deser t-like fastness of Ladakh.
The UN suggested they both pull back their
troops and hold a plebiscite. When Pakistan
balked at withdrawing, India used this as an
excuse to avoid a vote. And so things have
stood, uncomfor tably and with intermittent
violence, until now. 
While India and Pakistan spar, it is the
Kashmir is who suﬀer. Some more than oth-
ers: Jammu and Ladakh are loyally Indian,
and in truth the Kashmir is of Pakistan have
few links lef t with their cousins across the

border. The trouble lies with the 7m inhabit-
ants of the Vale, who have chafed at India’s
mix of democratic carrot and military stick.
“They treat us like a servant in a Brahmin
kitchen, who has to be scolded twice a day to
be kept in line,” says Mr Hussain. 
Yet Pakistan is no better. Repeating
their folly and expecting a diﬀerent outcome,
the generals have kept sending waves of
armed “volunteers”. India, forced to main-
tain a huge garr ison on permanent aler t,
hunts the intruders as terror ists, trampling
on ordinary Kashmir is as it does so. 
Public opinion on both sides remains in
a state of agitation. Pakistanis see the Vale
as a stolen inher itance, and pity the poor
Kashmir is who, in fact, enjoy greater free-
doms than they do. India—par ticularly now
under the Hindu-nationalist BJP—resents its
beautiful “crown” being inhabited by traitors
and ingrates, as it sees them. Since the
mid-1980s political turmoil has killed at least
44,000 in the Vale, and sadly forced the ﬂight
of its ancient 150,000-strong Hindu minor-
ity. The violence peaked in the early 2000s,
and eventually fell to a tenth of that level,
but in a renewed bout since last year more
than 400 people have died. “Whether by
intent or de facto, there has repeatedly been
collusion between India and Pakistan over
Kashmir, mainly to deny a voice to the Kash-
mir is themselves,” says Siddiq Wahid, a
Kashmir i histor ian. As for the Vale, the few
credible polls suggest its people want neither
India nor Pakistan but simply freedom,
whatever that may mean.

India

The elephant in its
labyrinth

India is becoming more nationalist and more
author itar ian 

“WE USED TO make fun of Indians,” recalls Deepak Per-
wani with a wistful grin. “They had no concept of a deodor-
ant; they wore polyester!” Fashionably stubbled and sporting a
crisp white shirt and jeans, the Pakistani designer gestures to-
wards the racks of sumptuous dresses in his Karachi showroom
to make his point. Then he frowns. “We had big cars and Coke
and Pepsi when they just had Limca and Thums Up; but India
was self-reliant, and in the end they were right.”
Mr Perwani is proud of his country, even if it has often
treated people of his Hindu faith badly. But like many Pakistanis
he is keenly aware that the dowdy, ambling giant next door now
moves at a far brisker pace. For the ﬁrst half of their 70-year sib-
ling rivalry it was Pakistan that made the bigger strides. Perhaps
because it had less in the way of industry or infrastructure to start
with, it was more energetic in building them up. But in all but two
of the past 25 years India’s GDP has grown faster; a decade ago it
surpassed Pakistan’s on a per-head basis, and the gap has relent-
lessly widened. 
Indians are justly pleased with their progress, though they
tend not to compare themselves with Pakistan but instead, aspir-
ationally, with China. Yet most economists would contest Mr
Perwani’s judgment. India’s post-independence self-reliance
model may have brought pride but not prosperity. That began to
arrive only when the old model, the “Licence Raj” of state plan-
ning and a closed economy, tipped India into ﬁnancial crisis in
the late 1980s. Since then successive governments have chipped

away layers of rules that had
“protected”, but also stiﬂed, In-
dia’s economy. 
There is no doubting In-
dia’s dynamism today. For ex-
ample, in the early 1990s it
made fewer than 2m motor-
bikes a year. Now it is the
world’s biggest producer, mak-
ing 20m new two-wheelers a
year, 18m for domestic con-
sumption and 2m for export.
Domestic air traﬃc has dou-
bled in the past decade. In 2016
the number of passengers grew
by 23%, prompting Indian air-
lines to order more than 1,000
new aircraft. India’s software
and services exports have near-
ly quadrupled over the past ten years, to $117bn a year. And in
February ISRO, the national space agency, lifted a record 104 sat-
ellites into orbit in a single launch, using an Indian-made rocket.
In May 2014 the BJP won a landslide election victory with
promises of a smaller, cleaner and more eﬀective state. The new
government trumpeted programmes to supercharge foreign in-
vestment, support industry and deliver better services. Cor-
porate India lapped it up. In a country inured to the convention
that India’s economy “grows at night while the government
sleeps”, in the words of the writer Gurcharan Das, a strong, ac-
tive, right-wing government seemed just what was needed.

But where’s the beef?

Three years later Mr Modi remains electorally invincible.
The political opposition has been scattered to India’s provinces
as the BJP’s electoral juggernaut has rumbled from victory to vic-
tory in the populous centre. The government remains relentless
in its self-promotion. In terms of economic performance, how-
ever, it looks as patchy as its predecessors. At the higher levels
there is less corruption, critics concede, and some long-awaited
laws have ﬁnally passed. But there have been few big, bold
moves for reform, such as privatising the state-owned institu-
tions that control 70% of banking (and have piled up colossal
portfolios of rotten loans). A much-touted goods and services tax
(GST) rolled out this month usefully replaces a welter of central
and state duties with a uniﬁed national tax, and should raise ex-
tra revenue. But the government’s mandarins went for an over-
complicated structure that will tax, for instance, diﬀerent sweets
and snacks at diﬀerent rates: 5% for rosogolla and gulab jamun,
12% for both plain and stuﬀed kachori, 18% for sweets containing
saﬀron or having a silver coating, and 28% for anything choco-
late-covered. Australia, with a far more orderly economy, im-
poses a ﬂat 10% GST.
When Mr Modi’s government has been bold, it has often
charged in the wrong direction. Even government supporters
now admit that its snap decision, in November 2016, to attack
“black money” by scrapping the 86% of currency held in higher-
value notes was a costly ﬂop. A promise to waive farmers’ debts
helped the BJP to an electoral victory in India’s most populous
state, Uttar Pradesh, in March. But this generosity has inevitably
encouraged farmers everywhere to demand the same, which by
some estimates could cost some $40bn. 
In yet another sudden decision, Mr Modi’s government in
May decreed what amounted to a ban on livestock markets. This
was explained as a humane intervention to prevent cruelty to
animals, but was widely seen as a sop to the BJP’s conservative

north Indian Hindu base, which abhors the slaughter of cows.
This cast a shadow over India’s largely Muslim-run and highly
successful $4bn buﬀalo-meat-export business. And the govern-
ment did not seem to have considered the impact on the 2.5m
people working in related trades, from leather shoes to cricket
balls. (However, in mid-July India’s supreme court ordered a
three-month stay on the market ban.) 
All this has accelerated a slide in domestic investment, es-
pecially in manufacturing. This does not mean that India’s econ-
omy is in serious trouble; its scale and diversity, its human capital
and its momentum all point to stronger growth in the medium
term. What worries India’s chattering classes more is Mr Modi’s
apparent inclination, in advance of the next national election in
2019, to pander to his party’s nationalist, conservative Hindu
base rather than to India’s merchant classes. “He has lost interest
in reform,” laments a Delhi businessman who voted for the BJP
in 2014. “His constituency is too broad, and he’s decided that
populism is what wins votes.”
Sectarian and caste tensions have risen, for which the BJP
bears considerable responsibility. In election campaigns, and
particularly in its successful pitch to Uttar Pradesh’s 220m peo-
ple, the party has harped on its predecessors’ supposed “ap-
peasement” of minority groups. In fact, India’s 14% Muslim mi-
nority is, by most measures, little better oﬀ than the 17% who are
dalits (the lowest caste, formerly known as untouchables). But
that does not seem to matter. Indian Muslims feel they are being
penalised for having dominated India in the past. 
After his party’s election victory in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Modi
appointed as its chief minister a saﬀron-robed priest, Yogi Adit-
yanath, who sponsors a right-wing Hindu youth movement.
State police now harass non-vegetarian restaurants and Muslims
who have allegedly seduced Hindu girls, but pay scant heed to
incidents such as an attack in May by upper-caste Thakurs on
low-caste dalits that left one person dead and dozens of houses
torched. Elsewhere in India, cow “protection” vigilantes have re-
peatedly attacked Muslims suspected of slaughtering cattle, of-
ten with fatal consequences. The response from BJP-run state
governments has been muted at best. 
Mr Modi’s government has pursued a Hindu-nationalist
agenda in other ways, too. Religious conservatives have quietly
displaced India’s old, privileged secular elite at the helm of uni-
versities and other state institutions. The BJP has so far made less
headway with plans to reform the judiciary, which remains
wary of executive inﬂuence, but it has had some success with the
press, much of which is owned by big business conglomerates
keen to toe the government’s line. Indian television, in particular,
has been infected by a style of hyperbolic ranting that makes
some debate programmes hard to watch. Media that remain crit-
ical of the government have faced problems ranging from with-
drawal of government advertising to spurious tax raids, lawsuits
on the basis of antiquated rules and harassment on social media
by legions of pro-government trolls. 
India’s press remains diverse, exuberant and healthily in-
quisitive, but journalists now fear being branded “anti-national”
for suggesting such things as less harsh means of calming Kash-
mir, or a more accommodating policy towards China. The sense
that space for public discussion is closing up is so strong that doz-
ens of retired oﬃcials from the elite Indian Administrative Ser-
vice issued a public letter in June warning against “rising authori-
tarianism and majoritarianism that does not allow for reasoned
debate, discussion and dissent”. 
Other Indians have a simpler way of voicing their worries.
“It’s ironic,” sighs a Delhi dinner hostess. “We’ve come all this
way in the world, and have a strong leader and a strong govern-
ment, but this country is looking more and more like Pakistan.” 7

Pakistan

The pushmi-pullyu

Politicians pull in one direction, the army in the other 

RAJA UMAR KHATTAB speaks softly and carefully: “I
would not say Karachi is a safe city, but it is better now than
before.” Seven years ago, the police compound that houses his
wood-panelled oﬃce, with its photos of three diﬀerent Pakistani
presidents decorating him for courage in the line of duty, was hit
by a truck bomb that left a 12-metre-wide blast crater and 20
dead. The diagonal scar on Mr Khattab’s neck is another story; as-
sassins had planted a bomb near his house. Such are the hazards
of heading the elite counter-terror force in a steamy metropolis
of 20m with a reputation as the most dangerous city in Asia. 
Ordinary crime is not so bad in Karachi. The trouble is an
explosive ethnic and sectarian mix, spiked with every ﬂavour of
radical Islam, primed by repeated waves of rural refugees, and
inﬂamed by law-enforcement tactics such as the “encounter”, a
disturbingly common event where the oﬃcial report says the
victim died in an exchange of ﬁre, but oddly enough his hands
are tied and no police suﬀered a scratch. In each of two big waves
of bloodletting, in the early 1990s and again from 2007 to 2013,
perhaps 10,000 people were murdered in the city. The worst epi-
sodes involved not terrorists but rival parties vying for control of
local government. 
Things are improving. Mr Khattab notes that there have
been no bombings in Karachi since his team busted a terrorist
bomb factory last year. Politically motivated deaths have fallen
steeply, from 2,029 in 2014 to 474 in 2016 and a mere 89 in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2017. One reason is the deployment since 2013 of the
Rangers, a tough paramilitary force that has used overwhelming
ﬁrepower, plus encounters, to arouse fear. “They don’t have fam-
ilies here like we do,” explains Mr Khattab. 
Karachi does feel relaxed, if slightly battered. Shops stay

open late, and on its bustling streets women mingle more com-
fortably with men than in strait-laced Lahore, Pakistan’s inland
metropolis 1,000km to the north. For those who live in the port
city’s expansive seaside suburbs, there are further compensa-
tions: big houses with poolside bars, bevies of servants and, be-
hind high walls and security guards, night spots as fancy as any
in Dubai or Mumbai. 
Pakistan has far fewer billionaires than India does, but feu-
dal habits are more ingrained. Miftah Ismail, chairman of the
Board of Investment, reckons that the country, with a workforce
of 65m, has around 10m domestic servants. “People talk about Is-
lam and forget about class motivation,” says Aatish Taseer, a
New York-based writer who is half Indian, half Pakistani. “You’d
think they would have done away with caste since everyone’s
Muslim, but it lurks everywhere just below the surface.”
One caste that does nicely is the army. Oﬃcially, Pakistan’s
annual defence spending runs to a modest $8bn, or 2.6% of GDP,
but that does not include oﬃcers’ generous pensions, which ac-
cording to SIPRI, a Swedish think-tank, push the total closer to
4%. Further spending may be hidden in Pakistan’s unusually
large budget allocations for contingent liabilities. A range of in-
dustries owned by the armed forces, as well as of army-operated
trusts such as the Fauji Foundation, a holding group with de-
clared assets of $3.3bn in 2015, also fall outside the budget. 
The army is Pakistan’s biggest property developer, too. Its
Defence Housing Authorities own large tracts of prime land in
every city, including 35 square kilometres along Karachi’s water-
front and a chunk of Lahore’s exclusive eastern suburbs amount-
ing to a quarter of the city’s area, complete with golf clubs, shop-
ping malls and business parks. “They treat us very well here, you
see,” says a former general, explaining why he retired to Lahore
rather than join some of his family in England. 
Such privilege also explains the army’s interest in sustain-
ing the sense of threat, and in keeping Pakistan’s politicians in
check. There are many ways of doing this. Political parties—many
of which are said to have been incubated by the army for this
purpose—tend to pander to the army. The police and courts keep
a respectful distance. And the army’s media wing exerts a pow-
erful inﬂuence on the press. Whereas some private television

The Economist July 22nd 2017 

S P E C I A L R E P O R T

I N D I A A N D P A K I S T A N

channels are seen as eager mouthpieces, others face pressures
that range from reprimands on the phone to threats and unfortu-
nate incidents. 
Given the opacity and unaccountability of the “deep state,”
it is not surprising that many Pakistanis see its hand behind the
proliferation of extremist religious groups. In response to terro-
rist attacks such as one on a boys’ school in Peshawar in 2014 that
left 141 dead, the army has increasingly taken the oﬀensive
against groups that challenge the state. But other, equally radical
outﬁts that direct violence at foreign enemies or at perceived do-
mestic troublemakers continue to evade punishment. In private,
journalists and politicians worry that harsh laws making blas-
phemy punishable by death, which have inspired more than one
murderous vigilante attack, are being left in place to discourage
dissent in general. 

Crack of Dawn

In the face of such constraints, Pakistan’s public life remains
remarkably vibrant. Indian journalists expressed grudging ad-
miration last year when Dawn, a Pakistani English-language
daily, published embarrassing details of a closed meeting be-
tween top military and civilian leaders. The politicians were
quoted as warning the generals that Pakistan risked diplomatic
isolation if the army did not rein in speciﬁc extremist groups. 
An equally telling exchange came in April this year when
Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, ﬁred a top adviser in an appar-
ent gesture to placate the army over what had become known as
the Dawn leaks. The general in charge of the army’s public rela-
tions riposted with a curt tweet saying this was not good enough.
Much of Pakistan’s press angrily declared that the army should
answer to elected leaders, not the other way around. A week lat-
er the general withdrew his tweet. 
Still, in the test of wills between civilians and the armed
forces, it is the generals who retain the upper hand. The army has
not taken action against the militants named in the Dawn leaks
but has come up with a counter-narrative, suggesting the breach
proves that civilians cannot be trusted with state secrets. Mr Sha-
rif, for his part, remains vulnerable. He faces ongoing investiga-
tions into evidence, leaked in the Panama papers that exposed
details of thousands of oﬀshore bank accounts, that his family
bought luxury properties in London. 
Mr Sharif’s centre-right party is still widely expected to
hold on to power in elections due next year. It has a virtual
stranglehold on the Punjab, home to nearly half the country’s
population. The rival centre-left Pakistan Peoples Party remains
strong in the second-most-populous province, Sindh, but has
been tarnished by corruption charges. A relative upstart, the
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI, led by Imran Khan, does well in
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, a largely Pashto-speaking province. But
despite Mr Khan’s cricket-star appeal and his anti-corruption
platform, his party has made little headway elsewhere. A dozen
smaller parties represent particular ethnic or religious groups.
So after 70 years as a nation Pakistan still lacks a truly na-

tional party. Provincial identities remain strong, and years of in-
terference by the deep state, including three periods of direct mil-
itary rule, have stunted the country’s political evolution.
“Democracy is all about conﬂict, so to make it work you need me-
diating institutions,” says Ayesha Jalal, a historian at Tufts Uni-
versity. “This is where Pakistan is truly lacking.” The country re-
mains a collection of provinces speaking diﬀerent languages, in
theory united by Islam but in fact held together by the army. 
This means that Pakistan is unlikely to change. Its economy
will continue to underperform and its society will remain con-
servative. The rich will continue to hide behind high walls.
“There may be green shoots, but they are not green enough or nu-
merous enough to last,” concludes an experienced Pakistani
journalist. No wonder that many of his countrymen are placing
high hopes on the great dragon peering down from the north. 7

China

One Lifebelt, One Road

A leg-up from Pakistan’s all-weather fr iend

MOVE OVER, DUBAI. Some day soon, cruise ships will dis-
gorge frolicking pensioners not by the palm-fringed Persian
Gulf but on the balmy Pakistan Riviera. From the muddy delta of
the Indus to the barren Baloch coast, a twinkling constellation of
attractions is set to rise: luxury hotels, water parks, golf courses,
health spas, yacht harbours, night clubs, the works. To top it all,
this “vacation product” will be developed in such a way that “Is-
lamic culture, historical culture, folk culture and marine culture
shall all be integrated.”
Or so promises a prospectus, drafted for the Chinese gov-
ernment by the China Development Bank, that sets out a de-
tailed vision of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Billed as a ﬂagship of China’s $900bn One Belt, One Road initia-
tive to build an Asia-wide infrastructure system tying China
more ﬁrmly to its markets, CPEC promises to inject some $60bn
of Chinese investment into Pakistan. More than half is ear-
marked for power generation, but there is plenty left over for
roads, seaports, airports, ﬁbre-optic cables, cement factories,
agro-industry and tourism. 
For a country that has struggled to nudge its capital-invest-
ment ratio to 15% of GDP—compared with around 30% for India
and 28% for Bangladesh in recent years—this gush of Chinese
money comes as a godsend. Not only does it promise to energise
the economy and ﬁx such problems as chronic power shortages;
it represents a strategic insurance policy against India. China has
long been Pakistan’s chief arms supplier, and has quietly provid-
ed diplomatic cover and technical aid for its nuclear programme.
As Chinese oﬃcials are fond of saying, China is an “all-weather
friend”—unlike America, which has lavished some $78bn in eco-
nomic and military aid on Pakistan since independence, but per-
iodically gets stingy when Islamabad fails to curb terrorists.
Yet when Dawn, a Karachi daily, published excerpts from
the CPEC plan in May, many Pakistanis were perturbed by what
they read. Among other things, the plan envisages a big role in
Pakistan’s agriculture for the Xinjiang Production and Construc-
tion Corps (XPCC), an arm of China’s defence ministry that since
the 1950s has spearheaded the settlement of Han Chinese in the
western border region. It is administratively autonomous, run-

ning whole cities as well as giant farms and industries, and is re-
sponsible for about 3m people, organised in army-style units.
Military training comes in handy when Xinjiang’s Muslim Turk-
ic-speaking Uighur natives grow restless. “There is a hue and cry
here when some town in Switzerland limits the size of minarets,
but not a peep when China bans Muslim names, or limits the
length of beards in Xinjiang,” notes a Pakistani journalist.

Mega megawatts

With solar power now cheaper than coal and gas, ques-
tions have been raised about China’s gung-ho investment in tra-
ditional thermal plants. Two 1,100MW nuclear reactors that Chi-
nese engineers are building west of Karachi have raised
environmental concerns. The giant seaside complex is just 30km
from the centre of one of the world’s biggest and most densely
populated cities. This particular reactor design has never been
built on such a scale, and the power plants happen to sit atop the
Makran Trench, a major faultline prone to severe earthquakes. In
November 1945 a tsunami struck the coast nearby, washing away
4,000 people.
Factory owners are already complaining that a free-trade
deal with China signed in 2007 has made their goods uncompet-
itive, and now economists fear that Pakistan may be mortgaging
its future to Chinese ﬁnance. Other recipients of Chinese aid,
such as Sri Lanka, have found themselves struggling to service
their debts. “Whether those billions come in loans or FDI, the
outﬂow will start within four or ﬁve years of the inﬂow,” says
Kaiser Bengali, a Karachi-based development economist. “It’s a
blueprint as clear as can be for colonisation.”
Pakistani oﬃcials scoﬀ at such qualms. The document
leaked by Dawn dates from 2015 and has since been revised, says
Ahsan Iqbal, the planning minister; and the Karachi nuclear
power station is being built to stringent safety standards. “Those
clubs and casinos are not happening,” says Miftah Ismail, the in-
vestment minister. “And we are not just going to hand over land
to the Chinese.” 
India views China’s spreading footprints next door with
dismay. Oﬃcials put on a brave face. The Chinese are naive, say
some, and will end up getting stung by Pakistan’s generals just as
the Americans did. Others hope that once China discovers how
far Pakistan’s deep state is entwined with Islamist radical groups,
it will show less patience than the Americans. 
Privately, however, Indian oﬃcials worry that Pakistan’s
new patron may play the same role as America once inadver-
tently did, or as Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent still does: to allow

Pakistan to sustain the awkward status quo. “Indian leaders have
always calculated that sooner or later Pakistan would have to
seek a normal relationship with us,” says Ashok Malik of the Ob-
server Research Foundation, a Delhi think-tank. “CPEC gives
them a new narrative: it puts them in China’s sphere.” 
Diplomatically, India has taken a tough line on China’s re-
gional initiatives. The CPEC road, it claims, runs through disput-
ed territory in Pakistan-held Kashmir. India has also sharply criti-
cised China’s broader, pan-Asian Belt and Road Initiative as a
boondoggle that will trap smaller countries in debt. 
India and China have had cool but calm relations since
their brief border war in 1962. Each country claims territory the
other holds. India’s continued hosting of the Dalai Lama, who
ﬂed into exile in 1959, riles Beijing. For its part, India objects to
China’s occasional use of its diplomatic clout, bolstered by a per-
manent seat on the UN Security Council, to block its ambitions.
“Our economy is growing faster and our population is about to
overtake theirs,” says an Indian diplomat, “But they still treat us
like some poor, skinny appendage to Asia.” 
Even so, the virtually impenetrable barrier of the Himala-
yas has generally allowed the rivals to agree to disagree. Bilateral
trade is around $80bn a year, ﬁve times as much as China’s trade
with Pakistan; China is India’s leading trade partner. 
India is trying to preserve its own sphere of inﬂuence in
South Asia through projects such as building roads and bridges
in Bangladesh, hydroelectric plants in Nepal and ports and rail-
ways in Sri Lanka. But it struggles to match the largesse of China,
which not only has a GDP ﬁve times India’s but also a leadership
that does not have to answer to voters. Last October Xi Jinping,
on the ﬁrst visit to Bangladesh by a Chinese president in 30 years,
pledged $24bn in loans, credits and infrastructure projects. India
responded with a generous new aid package of its own.
In its eﬀort to remain a strong, independent player, India is
trying to perform a ﬁne balancing act. But Dhruva Jaishankar of
the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, reckons China may not
be taking much notice: “When they talk about how America has
declined and this has become a multipolar world, what they ac-
tually mean is, China is the new pole.” 7

Prospects for peace

Don’t hold your breath

To forge a better relationship, both countr ies need to
tackle their problems at home

FOR TWO COUNTRIES so much at odds, India and Paki-
stan remain remarkably alike. When their national cricket
teams clashed in June at the Oval, a hallowed ground in London,
passions on both sides ran equally high. The star-studded Indian
team was tipped to win, but when Pakistan bowled out India’s
top players in short order, millions of Pakistani mobile phones
gloated with snaps of a spectator at the match wearing a T-shirt
inscribed “Winner takes Kashmir”. In Kashmir itself, revellers lit
the night sky with ﬁrecrackers. Outsiders mistake the Kashmiris’
tradition of cheering Pakistan as a sign of love; in fact they are
teasing the half-million Indian soldiers encamped in the Vale. 
Even after 70 years as an independent country, India has
still not quite gelled into a uniﬁed nation, and Kashmir is not the
only chronic hotspot. Insurrections have simmered in India’s re-
mote, neglected north-east for decades, and Maoist guerrillas

who started ﬁghting in the
1960s still rattle tribal regions
in the eastern states of Jhar-
khand and Chhattisgarh. 
Pakistan is no better. Its
oﬃcials gleefully condemn In-
dia’s abuses in Kashmir. But on
one day last winter when Paki-
stani newspapers ran big head-
lines about a single civilian
death in the Indian-adminis-
tered Vale, a curt army commu-
niqué was relegated to smaller
print: “Over 100 terrorists have
been killed since last night.”
The deaths were widely seen
as revenge for the murder by
suicide-bomb, a day earlier, of
some 90 worshippers at a Suﬁ shrine, one of many attacks by
Sunni extremists. In the past decade Pakistan has suﬀered about
55,000 casualties from terror-related violence, a third of them ci-
vilians. Whatever India’s troubles in Kashmir, they pale next to
such murderous attacks on targets ranging from Pakistani school-
children to Shia Muslims.
Whereas India’s men in uniform face intense scrutiny in
Kashmir, Pakistan enjoys a far freer hand. In trying to stamp out
terrorism along its north-west frontier, its army has demolished
whole villages. Balochistan, a province of rugged deserts that
takes up 43% of Pakistan’s area, has been in sporadic revolt since
independence; one local NGO estimates the number of suspect-
ed separatists kidnapped by security forces there from the high
hundreds up to 18,000. In 2016 alone,728 people across Pakistan
suﬀered “enforced disappearance”, as counted by the commis-
sion of inquiry that investigates them. Some reappear alive and
well, others as roadside corpses. The state ﬂatly denies any un-
pleasantness. In a meeting at the Pakistani senate in December, a
former interior minister insisted that the culprits in Balochistan
are Indian agents disguised in Pakistani uniform.
On other shortcomings the countries are more evenly
matched. Both have greatly underinvested in education and
health, for example, forcing even the poorest to resort to private
schools and hospitals. The formal economy generates few jobs;
in Pakistan 73% of the non-farm workforce is oﬀ the books, in In-
dia over 80%. Both countries have made great strides in reducing
poverty but remain starkly unequal, and indeed are becoming
more so. In 2016 just 1% of Indians owned more than 58% of the
country’s wealth, up from a 37% share in 2000. Earnings are
skewed geographically, too: India’s richest states enjoy four
times the income per person of its poorest, Bihar. In the smaller
towns of Pakistan’s Balochistan over 90% of the population lives
in poverty, compared with only 10% in Lahore. 
On the harder-to-measure index of intolerance, on which
Pakistan used to be well ahead, India is beginning to catch up.
Since the 1980s Pakistan has seen more than 60 extra-judicial kill-
ings of supposed blasphemers. The death in April of Mashal
Khan, a Pakistani college student brutally lynched by his fellow
students after being spuriously tagged as a blasphemer, made
global headlines. Yet when Farook Hameed, a 31-year-old father
of two in the Indian city of Coimbatore, was hacked to death by
childhood friends for having repudiated Islam and declared
himself an atheist, there was little reaction from abroad. Ha-
meed’s death was a rare exception; Indian Islam remains rela-
tively diverse and tolerant. Yet the government’s failure to curb
murderous cow vigilantes or online trolls who brand dissent as
treason, even as it uses state institutions to harass critics, means

2 there is less space for free expression. 
Communal aggression in India has left Muslims and other
minorities feeling increasingly vulnerable, but it seems to help
win votes. The shifting electoral tide suggests a gradual transfor-
mation of India’s underlying sense of national destiny, from be-
ing a pluralist country enriched by diversity to becoming a more
narrowly deﬁned Hindu rashtra, or state, in much the same way
that secular Pakistan became an “Islamic” state. This is very
much the vision of the Hindu nationalist groups whose zeal un-
derpins the BJP’s success; not coincidentally, their intellectual
evolution shows striking parallels with Islamist groups such as
the Muslim Brotherhood. 
In some ways, the two countries seem to be goading each
other to become more aggressive. “We used to think partition
was a terrible mistake,” admits a liberal-minded historian in La-
hore. “But with Modi in power it looks more and more like Jin-
nah had it right all along.” In the same way, ever more Indians
have begun to conﬂate their enemies: Pakistanis, Kashmiris and
Muslims in general, they feel, do not belong in their country. 
India and Pakistan are unlikely to resolve their diﬀerences
in the foreseeable future. On the contrary, impending elections,
in Pakistan next year and in India in 2019, will make things
worse: there are votes in taking a tough approach to the enemy.
This does not mean that reconciliation is impossible, but that it
will need to come through building up trust in a slow, plodding
way rather than through some sudden diplomatic breakthrough.
And the most obvious way to foster mutual trust is for both sides
to start solving their own problems at home. 

Peace begins at home

That means, ﬁrst of all, creating stronger, more conﬁdent de-
mocracies. Both countries urgently need to attend to their crum-
bling institutions, most importantly their underfunded, unre-
formed systems of justice and education. They also need bold
electoral reforms. Political funding in both countries is opaque,
and the ﬁrst-past-the-post system can produce conspicuously
unfair results.
In Pakistan, elected leaders need to gain fuller control of the
levers of power, and ultimately to put the soldiers back in their
barracks. It would help, too, if the generals were to end the impu-

nity enjoyed by extremist
groups that terrorise their own
fellow citizens. And Pakistan’s
politicians need a more solid
base of popular consent. One
way to achieve that would be to
divide provinces into more eﬃ-
cient and representative units.
Karachi, a huge, polyglot trading
city built up from waves of refu-
gees, is an uncomfortable ap-
pendage to the rural, backward
Sindhi-speaking province of
Sindh. Punjab is too dominant.
India, too, could do with
splitting giant states such as Ut-
tar Pradesh into more manage-
able units. That would mean
more frequent but less distract-
ing elections, allowing the rul-
ing party at the centre to get on
with running the country. Divid-
ing Jammu and Kashmir would
end the pretence that lowland
Hindus and highland Muslims
form a cohesive whole, and give
the distinct people of the Vale a
clearer voice in their future. In
private, many of them say they
would be happiest
inside a
democratic, secular India that
acknowledges that they are dif-
ferent and treats them with dignity. 
If India and Pakistan were more conﬁdent in themselves,
they would be less worried by the normal human exchanges be-
tween countries that underpin peaceful relations. Instead, when
tensions have heightened in recent months Pakistan has banned
Indian ﬁlms, while India has abruptly sent home Pakistani
schoolchildren on a goodwill tour and denied visas to Pakistanis
seeking medical care. Such pettiness is destructive.
Sadly, reconciliation may become
even harder as time goes by. For young In-
dians in Kolkata or Bangalore, Pakistan is
no longer viewed as a lost cousin but sim-
ply as a particularly bothersome distant
neighbour. Younger Pakistanis follow the
news from India more closely, but are in-
creasingly alienated by their neighbour’s
rightward, Muslim-bashing drift. 
The ruling establishments in both
countries ﬁnd that mutual enmity serves
their interests better than friendship
would. Shifting geopolitics has not
helped. India had hoped that its growing
economy and stronger ties with America
would make a more isolated Pakistan
keener for reconciliation, but China has
moved nimbly into the breach, and so far
looks set to entrench the diﬀerences be-
tween India and Pakistan further.
Seventy years ago the Pakistani poet
Faiz Ahmed Faiz lamented the suﬀering
and unfulﬁlled promise of partition thus:
“This is not the dawn we longed for.”
Alas, that dawn has yet to arrive. 7

He also callsthem a “strong-hold ofpost-communists”, referringtoPiS’sclaim thatPolish liberalshave secrettiesto the formercommunistregime.

Barelya yearago,with the woundsfrom the refugee crisisstill gaping, DonaldTusk, the presidentofthe European Council, could be heardwarningthata British vote to quitthe EU threatened to bringaboutthe collapse ofwestern civilisation. In halfthe countriesonthe continent, snarlingpopulistseagerforEuropean disintegra-tion were terrifyingthe pro-EU establishment.Yetoverthe pastfewmonths, gloom hasturned to sunshine.In June MrTuskdeclared thathe had neverfeltso optimisticaboutthe EU. Much ofthe creditgoesto Emmanuel Macron.France’snewlyminted presidenthaslifted pro-Europeans’ spiritsnotonlybywinningelection wrapped in the EU ﬂagbutbydoingso in revolutionaryfashion, emergingfrom nowhere to humbleFrance’sold parties(aswell asMarine Le Pen, the nationalistwhostalked Eurocrats’ nightmaresformonths). Rarelydo members ofthe European establishmentgetto feel like insurgents.Some ofthe optimism needstempering. Leave aside the factthatnone ofEurope’srecentemergencieshasbeen properlyﬁxed, from Greece’seconomy, on an IVdrip ofendlessbail-outs,to the migrantsstreamingacrossthe Mediterranean. MrMacroniscertainlybrimmingwith ideasto reform the euro zone asthecore ofthe EU—from a common investmentbudgetto the estab-lishmentofa parliamentand a ﬁnance minister.

Thenewman in the Elysée seemsto be pushingold French ideas.Take EUlabourpolicy. Perhapsto sugarthe pill ofthe reformshe wantsFrench unionsto swallow, MrMacron promisesto tight-en EU ruleson the payand conditionsofEuropeansworking tem-porarilyin othercountries. To eastern European governmentsthatlookslike a bid to keep theirlow-costworkersout ofthe high-paid west, recallingthe old French paranoia over“Polish plumb-ers”. MrMacron’srecentcharge thatsome countriestreat the EUlike a “supermarket” so unnerved the Visegrad four(the CzechRepublic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) thattheyhastily createdworkinggroupswith France to plead theircases.Thatmaybe justthe start. MrMacron wantsa Europe that“protects” citizens, a phrase thatimpliesanynumberofpolicies,from co-ordinated minimum wagesto prohibitionson “socialdumping” and harmonised taxrules. Fansofsuch ideastend tositinside the euro zone. Until recentlyBritain would tryto pre-ventthe euro zone from pre-cookingsuch dealsand presentingthem to the restofthe EU asfaitsaccomplis. Thishelped smoothdivisionsbetween the euro-zone “ins” and the “outs”. ButBrexitleavesthose outside the euro withouta champion. Oﬃcials inBrusselsnote thatafterBritain leaves, the 19-membercurrencyarea will accountfor85% ofthe EU’seconomy. Thisisa none-too-subtle wayoflocatingthe EU’s“core”. The idea ofKerneuropa (“core Europe”) hasa longpedigree.Firstpushed yearsago byWolfgangSchäuble, Germany’scurrentﬁnance minister, and latertaken up byNicolasSarkozy, one ofMrMacron’spredecessors, itwasadvanced asa tool to manage an in-creasinglyunwieldyEU. Todaya core Europe builtaround theeuro zone could ﬁnd itselfcollaboratingon thornynon-economicissuestoo, such asquotasforredistributingrefugees. Should MrMacron gethiswishesforinstitutional changesto the euro zone,itspolitical heftcould leave the gaggle ofnon-members lookinglike an afterthought. To western European countriesinterested inmore integration, this“multi-speed” Europe holdsappeal. Buteastern European governmentsdetestthe idea offormal consign-mentto a second class. “Eitherwe getin the integration express orwe’ll be stuckin the depoton the second track,” said RobertFico,Slovakia’sprime minister, lastmonth.Wedged apartIfsome eastern countriesstruggle to make themselvesheard, itcan be theirown fault. Governmentslike Poland’ssabotage theirown case when theypromulgate lurid horrorstoriesabout mi-grantsor, worse, undermine the democraticvaluesto which theysigned up asEU members. Moderate governmentsthatmaysym-pathise with theirargumentson the single marketwill recoilfrom association with countriesin the grip ofpopulism.Several have joined MrMacron in wonderingoutloud howcountriesthatdefythe EU’sprinciplesmightbe sanctioned, per-hapsbycuttingthe generoussubsidiestheyreceive. Ifsuch coun-triescontinue to driftawayfrom the EU’sfundamental values,otherswill be more likelyto plough on with theirideas forinte-gration and leave the stragglersbehind. The dividesare notalwaysclear-cut: Slovakia, Slovenia andthe Balticstatesare euro members, and dislike beinglumped inwith the more intransigenteasterners. Othersmaysoon face hardchoices, such asthe Czech Republic, which sendsover60% ofitsexportsto the euro zone. Germanywill have to playa vital bridg-ingrole between a resurgentFrance, with which itcan strike adeal on euro-zone reforms, and the eastern European countriesplugged into itssupplychainsthrough the single market.

Nearlyfourmonthshaveelapsed since MrsMayinvoked Article 50ofthe EUtreaty, settinga two-yeardeadlineforBrexitthatwill expire on March 30th2019. The clockisticking. And atﬁrst blushthere hasbeen much activity: a bigspeechbyMrsMayatLancasterHouse in January;several governmentwhite papers; bills in-troduced in Parliament; and the start offor-mal Brexitnegotiationsin Brussels.Yetforall thisactivity, almost no pro-gresshasbeen made towardsdecidingtheform thatBrexitshould take.

Even issuesthatseemed settled in the LancasterHousespeech have resurfaced since MrsMaylostherslim parliamentarymajorityin a snapelection she called forJune 8th.Thisisthe political backdrop to theBrexittalksin Brussels. The second roundstarted thisweekbetween negotiatingteamsled forthe EUbyMichel Barnier, theEuropean Commission’spointman, andforBritain byDavid Davis, the Brexit secre-tary.

The latestrowisoverEuratom, Europe’satomic-ener-gytreaty, which Britain will leave on exit-ingthe EU, butwhich some ToryMPsthinkitshould rejoin asan associate. MrsMay’slackofa majorityin eitherhouse meansthatthe role ofParliament,which had been sidelined, will be crucial.The governmenthasjustpublished its EUwithdrawal billand ispromisingatleastseven otherBrexitbills, rangingfrom im-migration and agriculture to trade and cus-toms.Gettingall these through unamend-ed will be extremelydiﬃcult.

And although Britainhasconceded thatitfacesan exitbill, itssize ishighlycontentious. Thisweek’sround oftalksconcluded with little pro-gresson anyofthe three main topics.Itisthe long-term relationship that mat-tersmost. Because MrsMayand MrDavisinsistthatthe onlyinterpretation of the ref-erendum isthatBritonsvoted to take backcontrol ofborders, lawsand money, theyare pursuingwhatisknown asa hardBrexit: Britain mustleave both the EU’ssin-gle marketand itscustomsunion, end freemovementofpeople from the EUand es-cape from the oversightofthe EU’ssu-preme court, the European CourtofJustice(ECJ). Instead itwill forge a “deep and spe-cial partnership” with the EU, including acomprehensive free-trade deal.Britain and the European UnionThe sixﬂavours ofBrexitThe EU oﬀers manymenus, from Norwegian to Turkish.

Although theypreferred MrsMay,who campaigned on the Remain side, tootherTories, theyalso knewthather mainexperience ofthe EUcame in 2013, when ashome secretaryshe negotiated Britain’sopt-outfrom a raftofjustice and home af-fairsmeasuresand then chose which onesto optbackinto.

ABrexitwithouta deal would certainlybe bad forthe EU.

TheEUalso fretsoverMrsMay’sbeliefthatherpredecessor, David Cameron, failed to winenough concessionsin hisEUnegotiationsbecause ofhisunwillingnessto walkaway.In Brussels, the bargainingpowerisseen asbeingon the EU’sside, notleastbecause ofArticle 50’stwo-yeardeadline.Menu bymenuThisisreﬂected in the EU’sapproach toBrexit, which isto insistthatfuture rela-tionsmustfollowone ofa numberofﬁxed-price menus. Each menuhasadvan-tagesand disadvantages; each hasa fewside dishesthatcan be added atthe mar-gin. Butwhatisnotpermitted isto go à lacarte. MrBarnierunderlined thisrecentlywhen he declared thatitwasnotpossibleto leave the single marketbutretain all itsbeneﬁts, norto quitthe customsunion butkeep frictionlesstrade.The ﬁrstmenuisfull membership,which the Brexitreferendum rejected. Sec-ond ismembership ofthe European Eco-nomicArea (EEA), which linksNorway, Ice-land and Liechtenstein to the EU. EEAmembersare fullyintegrated into the EU’ssingle marketformostgoodsand services,butnotforagriculture and ﬁsheries. Theyare notin a customsunion with the EU,which allowsthem to strike free-tradedealswith third countries, although thismeanstheirexportsare also subjecttorules-of-origin inspection. Butsingle-mar-ketrulesrequire them to acceptthe EU’sfourfreedomsofmovementofgoods, ser-vices, capital and, crucially, people. Theyalso have to observe lawswhich theyhaveno sayin makingand which (atleastim-plicitly) are enforced byEuropean judges.And theymake contributionsto the EUbudgetalmostaslarge asBritain’s, on a per-person basis. The third menuisa Swissone. Alongwith Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein,Switzerland isa memberofthe EuropeanFree Trade Association (EFTA), butitis notin the EEA. Ithastwo setsofcomplex bilat-eral dealswith the EUthatgive itprivilegedaccessto the single marketforgoods,though notforagriculture. Butitis outsidethe marketformostservices(including ﬁ-nancial services). Itisalso outside the cus-tomsunion. Ittoo hasto observe the freemovementofpeople, and to acceptmostsingle-marketlaws. And itmakesa big con-tribution to the EUbudget.MrsMay’sinsistence on takingbackcontrol ofborders, lawsand moneymeansthatshe hasruled outboth these menus.Yetsome frillscould be attached to makeeithermore appealing. EEAcountrieshavean “emergencybrake” to blockthe freemovementofpeople, though ithasneverbeen used. Liechtenstein isallowed to setquotasforEU migrants. The Swissare not,buttheymaybe allowed to ensure thatmostjobsare oﬀered ﬁrstto Swisscitizens.Asforbudgetpayments, theyare smallerthan forfull membersand are mostlydressed up asresearch fundsoraid to east-ern Europe. ButBritain would struggle togeta deal like thatofSwitzerland. The EUdislikesthe complexityofthe arrangementand would be unlikelyto replicate it forthefarbiggerBritish economy.The fourth menumightbe called Turk-ish. Like San Marino and Andorra, Turkeyisnotin the EEA, EFTAorthe single market,butithasformed a customsunion with theEUfornon-agricultural goodstrade. ThisforcesTurkeyto applycommon externaltariﬀsﬁxed bythe EU, butthatbringstheadvantage thatthere are no barriersorrules-of-origin checkson exportsto the EU.IfBritain were to form a customsunionwith the EU, itcould tryto add some ser-vicesaswell (Turkeyand the EU are negoti-atingan upgrade oftheirown customs un-ion to do justthat). The advantage of beingin a customsunion butnotthe single mar-ketisthatitdispenseswith the EU’sfourfreedoms, budgetcontributionsand theECJ. Itwould also preventthe return ofcus-tomscontrolsatthe Irish border.The main disadvantage ofthe customs-union option isthatitprecludesfree-tradedealsforgoodswith third countries.In ef-fect, itwould do Liam Fox, the internation-al-trade secretary, outofa job. Yet some ar-gue thatbarrier-free trade in goodswiththe EUisworth more than anynumberofhypothetical future free-trade dealswiththird countriesbeingtouted byDrFox. Toquote the wordsofone MP, “We exportmore to Ireland than we do to China, al-mosttwice asmuch to Belgium aswe do toIndia and nearlythree timesasmuch toSweden aswe do to Brazil. Itisnotrealisticto thinkwe could justreplace Europeantrade with these newmarkets.” ThiswasMrsMay, speakingin April 2016.Fifth isthe menuthatthe prime minis-terherselffavours: a deep and comprehen-sive free-trade deal.

Thedisadvantage isthatfree trade isnot thesame asfrictionlesstrade. There would becustomscontrolsand rules-of-originchecks, manyserviceswould notbe cov-ered and there would be non-tariﬀbarriersthanksto diﬀerential regulation. The ﬁnal menu, which would also belikelyin the end to followfrom no deal, isto revertto tradingwith the EUunderWorld Trade Organisation rules.

Thismeansthat, ifBritainand the EUagreed to avoid mutual 10% ta-riﬀson cars, theywould have to oﬀerthesame deal to othercountries.Itwill costyouThe Brexitmenusshare two characteris-tics. One isthat, exceptforthe EEAoption,theywould take time, perhapsseveralyears, to negotiate.The second isthatall would imposelosseson the economy. Brexiteersrejectedthe Treasury’sprojectionsforthe cost ofBrexitlastyearas“projectfear”. ButtheCentre forEconomicPerformance attheLondon School ofEconomicshasremod-elled the trade consequences. Itconcludesthatthe hardestform ofBrexit, a reversionto WTOterms, would cuttrade by40%overten yearsand reduce annual incomeperperson by2.6%. Asofterversion like theNorwegian model would cuttrade by20-25% and reduce annual incomesby1.3%.And these are juststaticeﬀects. Therewould also be dynamicnegative eﬀectsfrom lowerinvestmentand slowerproduc-tivitygrowth.Britonsare unprepared forsuch a hittotheirincomes. And the more distantBrit-ain’srelationship with the EU, the biggerthe income loss. Thisisa crucial trade-oﬀthatMrsMay’sgovernmenthasbeen re-luctantto acknowledge. Britonsface achoice: to minimise lossesfrom Brexit, theymustcede some sovereigntyto the EU,while to maximise freedom from Brussels,theymustaccepta largerdrop in incomes.Whatmakesthischoice harderisthestate ofthe economy. Immediatelyafterthe referendum Brexiteerscrowed that thedoomsterswere wrong: the economyhadnotsuﬀered and conﬁdence remainedhigh. Yetin the ﬁrstquarterof2017 Britainfell from beingone ofthe fastest-growingeconomiesin the EUto the slowest-grow-ing, partlybecause ofuncertaintiesoverBrexit. Higherinﬂation, caused in part byafall in the pound, iseatinginto real in-comes. Itisno wonderthatPhilip Ham-mond, the chancellor, isdemandingthatthe economyshould be given higherprior-ityin the Brexitnegotiations. Labour isalsoarguingfora “jobsﬁrst” Brexit.Noristrade with the EUthe onlypro-blem. Before even gettinginto newtradedeals, DrFoxmustﬁnd a wayto replicatethe 35 free-trade agreementsthatBritaincurrentlyhasvia the EUwith 53 countries.The rawarithmeticisthatsome 44% ofBrit-ish exportsgo to the EU, 16% to countrieswith which the EUalreadyhasa free-tradedeal and about20% to America. DonaldTrump mayhave promised an earlydealwith Britain, butexperience showsit willbe neithereasynorquick—and MrTrumpmaythen be longgone.Third countriesneed to knowthe termsofBritain’strade with the EUbefore mak-ingbilateral deals. Monique Ebell of theNational Institute ofEconomicand SocialResearch, a think-tank, calculatesthatdowngradingfrom single-marketmember-ship to a free-trade dealwith the EUwouldreduce British trade byabouta ﬁfth, where-asfree-trade dealswith the fourBRICcoun-triesplusAmerica, Canada, Australia, NewZealand, Indonesia and South Africa com-bined would boostitbyjust5%.Nextisthe question ofEUregulators, ofwhich Euratom isbutone. Some 35 EUreg-ulatorybodiesgovern such thingsasmedi-cines, aviation safety, environmental rules,ﬁnancial servicesand phytosanitarystan-dards. All come underthe ECJ, so ifthat re-mainsa red line forMrsMayBritain mustsetup a newsetofregulatorsofits own.These would largelyhave to replicate theEU’srulesto maintain regulatoryequiva-lence. Mostcompaniespreferto stick withthe system theyknow, and manyfearthatsettingup British regulatorswould notonlytake time and moneybutalso forcethem to obeytwo lotsofrules, notone.There ismuch else to do. Sorting outwhatpowersrepatriated from Brusselsshould go to the devolved administrationswill be testing; the Scotssaytheymighthold up the EUwithdrawal bill, and La-boursupportsthem. Hundredsoftreatieson mattersrangingfrom airtransport todata sharingmustbe renegotiated withthird countries. Waysmustbe found to co-operate in scientiﬁcresearch, foreign poli-cy, defence, security, counter-terrorism andintelligence. All ofthese raise yetagain theissue ofthe ECJ, which hasjurisdictionoverdata-sharingand variousjustice andhome-aﬀairsmeasures, includingthe Euro-pean arrestwarrant.SictransitgloriaOne conclusion isthatall thiscannot pos-siblybe dealtwith byMarch 2019. To givethe European Parliamenttime to ratify theArticle 50 divorce, itstermsmustbe agreedbyaround October2018. Businessesthathave to plan ahead, such asairlines, needcertaintylongbefore that.

And thatpointsto somethingelse, which haslongbeen assumed in Brusselsand isslowly be-ingaccepted in London: thatthere must beatransition period afterMarch 30th 2019.Yetitwill notbe simple to arrange one,because negotiatorswill wantto know theultimate destination, atleastin principle,before agreeingthe termsfora transition.Businesslobbiesand, quietly, the Treasury,are pushingto stayin both the single mar-ketand the customsunion duringtransi-tion, to minimise disruption. The simplestidea would be to prolongthe statusquo forthree orfouryears, butthatwould not sat-isfythose who are keen to geton with leav-ing. An alternative mightbe temporaryEEAmembership, butBrexiteersmightfearthatthe temporaryarrangementwouldbecome permanent.Transition will be keyto makingBrexitlessdisruptive. Buton itsown itwill notre-solve the dilemmasfacingthe govern-ment. Forthat, more honesty, lessinclina-tion to taranycriticsasseekingto subvertdemocracyand greaterreadinessto ac-knowledge Brexit’strade-oﬀsare required.One otherthingiscertain: those who saidthe onlywayto take the EUoﬀBritain’spo-litical agenda wasto have a referendumhave been proved utterlywrong. 746BritainThe EconomistJuly22nd2017THE end ofthe currentparliamentarysession, on July20th, isagood time to reﬂecton the mood ofBritish politics. Severalthingscatch the attention: anxietyaboutthe future, exasperationatthe childish anticsofseniorpoliticians, confusion aboutBrexit.Butthe moststrikingthingisanger. Politiciansare angry witheach other. The publicisangrywith politicians. The internetthrobswith vitriol. American historianshave dubbed the periodafterthe warof1812 “the era ofgood feelings”. The currentperiodin British politicscould be dubbed the era ofbad feelings.Thisweekthecabinetinﬁghtingbecame so viciousthatThere-sa May, the prime minister, wasforced to tell herministers to shutup orship out. Even more disturbingisa surge in violent threats.Ayearafterthe murderofJo Cox, a LabourMP, bya far-rightex-tremist, politiciansofall stripessaythattheyfearfor theirsafety,such isthe intensityofthe insultstheyface. The threats extend tojournalists. The BBC wasreportedlyobliged to provide its politi-cal editor, Laura Kuenssberg, with personal security.The worstofitisdirected atwomen and minorities.Diane Ab-bott, Britain’sﬁrstblackfemale MP, told Parliamentthatshe hadreceived tweetssayingthatshe should be hanged “iftheycouldﬁnd a tree bigenough to take the fatbitch’sweight.”Duringtheelection campaign, Laboursupportersin Bristol unveiled a ban-nerofMrsMaywearingStarofDavid earrings. Manyofthe abus-ersregard criticism oftheirloathsome behaviourasan invitationto redouble theireﬀorts. When Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP, gaveaspeech condemningthe culture ofabuse, she wasaccused ofbeinga “bully”, a “saboteur” and, worstofall, a “Tory”.Britain isnotunique in all this. Donald Trump hasushered inan era ofbad feelingsin America thatiseven more unpleasant.The runner-up forFrance’spresidency, Marine Le Pen, leads a xe-nophobicparty. SupportersofTurkey’srulingpartyuse onlinebotsto harassreporters. Britain hasexperienced otherspasms ofpolitical rage in recentdecades, particularlyoverMargaretThatcher’sbreakingofthe miners’ strike and TonyBlair’ssupportforthe Iraq war.

Itsmood isdarkeningasthatofEu-rope islightening.And itisengaged in history-shapingnegotia-tionswith the European Union thatcan be saved from disasteronlywith the help ofclearheadsand reasoned debate.WhyhasBritish politicsbecome so unpleasant? The answerto almosteverythingthese daysisBrexit, which hassplit thecountryand inﬂamed opinion. But Brexitisa symptom aswellasa cause. Britain issuﬀeringfrom a malign combination of eco-nomicdisruption and stagnation. Smartmachinesare eliminat-ingsome jobs, reorganisingothersand spreadinganxiety. Aver-age payhasdeclined bysome 7%since the ﬁnancial crisisof 2008.People mightbe willingto acceptdisruption ifitwere accompa-nied byimprovementsin livingstandards, orperhapsto toleratestagnantlivingstandardsiftheywere accompanied bystability.Butthe combination ofthe two isuniquelydangerous, unleash-inga wave ofpopulism thatisgainingmomentum.Populistsrage againstthe centristestablishmentfor failingtokeep itspromise ofcrisis-free growth (rememberwhen GordonBrown claimed to have abolished the boom-and-bustcycle?).And theydemonise anybodywho standsin theirwayastraitorsto be crushed ratherthan aserringcolleaguesto be persuaded.Two cabinetministers, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox, havequestioned the patriotism ofpeople who raise doubtsaboutBrexit. The DailyMaildubbed three High Courtjudges“enemiesofthe people” aftertheyruled againstthe governmentin a Brexit-related case. Internettrollshave suggested thatBlairites in the La-bourParty(some ofwhom happen to be Jewish) should be sub-jected to “the ﬁnal solution”.Two thingsare strengtheningthe poison. The ﬁrstis the exis-tence ofsharp divisionswithin each ofBritain’smain politicalparties. The Tories’ longcivil waroverEurope hasentered an al-mostsurreal phase.

Such le-thal violence followed thathe withdrew.)Anothervital safeguard is“parallel votetabulation” (PVT), wherebypartyagentsand independentobserverscan witnessthe countin randomlyselected polling sta-tionsand announce each result, whichwill be agreed upon, photographed bysmartphone and transmitted. Elsewhere,and in Kenya in 2013, PVT hasbeen veryclose to the ﬁnal result(see chart), makingitfarharderforan incumbentto inﬂate histally, atleastbya large amount. “PVT isahighlyeﬀective checkon the electoral com-missions,” saysan expertfrom the Interna-tional Foundation forElectoral Systems(IFES).

NicCheeseman ofBirmingham Uni-versity, an experton electionsin Africa, haswarned againstwhathe callsthe “fetishi-sation” oftechnology. “In some casesthecomplexityofdigital processesmayactu-allyrenderelectionsmore opaque and vul-nerable to manipulation—oratleastthesuspicion ofmanipulation,” he haswrit-ten. Election machinesin Ghana in 2012failed more often where no observerswerepresent, suggestingtamperingwith the in-tention offorcinga fallbackonto the moreeasilyﬁddled manual system. Technologycan even facilitate fraud. In Azerbaijan in2013, the election commission accidentallyjumped the gun byreleasingan electroni-callyveriﬁed result—a daybefore the vote. “Youcan’tdigitise integrity,” saysJohnGithongo, a veteran Kenyan anti-corrup-tion campaigner, implyingthatthe corruptpoliticianswho still dominate the coun-try’spoliticswill notlettechnology getinthe wayofﬁddlingthe resultifitgoesagainstthem. “The manual countisdeﬁni-tive,” saysone foreign observer. “The elec-tronicone isa backup”—and should notbeconsidered a fail-safe.

Thatwaspartlybyusingstate resourcesto out-spend the opposition, often commandeer-ingthe civil service and sometimesthearmy. In Uganda the perennial challenger,Kizza Besigye, hasrepeatedlybeen arrest-ed duringcampaigns. Incumbentsoftenensure biased media coverage.

Prince Hal’stransformation, from wastrel prince to sobermonarch, is doubt-lessone he would like to emulate. Butasa guide to the ride-hail-ingﬁrm’sﬁnancial dilemma, “Macbeth” isthe bestplay. This lineespeciallyresonates: “I am in blood stepp’d in so farthat, should Iwade no more, returningwere astediousasgo o’er.” Uberhasbled moneyforyearsin an attemptto become theabsolute rulerofitsindustry. Once MrKalanick’sreplacementisfound, voiceswill whisperthatthe ﬁrm, like Macbeth himself, isin too deep to altercourse. Butthe newbossmustchange Uberfrom a companythatsacriﬁcesanythingforitsambitions, to onewhich hasa realisticvaluation and usesresourceseﬃciently.Itsproductiselegantlysimple. Ubermakesa marketbetweendriversand passengersand takesa cutofabouta ﬁfth ofthe fare.The more people use itsservice, the betteritfunctions, with lowerwaitingperiodsforpassengers, and betteruse ofdrivers’ time.Some 55m people in 574 citiesuse iteverymonth. Underlyingsaleswere $4bn in 2016, overdouble whattheywere the year be-fore (all ﬁguresexclude Uber’sChinese arm, which itsold to a lo-cal rival, Didi Chuxing, lastyear). Uber’smain trouble ishigh ex-pectations. Itssupportersthinkitwill become the next AlphabetorFacebook. Atitslastfundinground in 2016 (itisprivate), inves-torsvalued itata whopping$68bn.Butthe nextbosswill have to deal with an income statementthatisscarierthan the Thane ofCawdor. Underlyingpre-taxlosseswere $3bn-3.5bn lastyearand about$800m in the mostre-centquarter. Some $1bn-2bn oflastyear’sred inkwasbecause ofsubsidiesthatUberpaid to driversand passengersto draw themto itsplatform. Atleastanother$1bn wenton overheadsand ondevelopingdriverlesscars; moneyisalso beingsplashed on anewfood-deliveryventure and a plan to build ﬂyingcars.To putits2016 lossin perspective, thatnumberwaslarger thanthe cumulative lossmade bySilicon Valley’sleastproﬁt-con-sciousbigcompany—Amazon—in 1995-2002. Measured bysales,Uberisthe world’s1,158th-biggestﬁrm. Judged bycash losses, itranksin the top 20. Itisnoweightyearsold, butstill probablyyearsawayfrom beingstable enough to make an initial public of-feringofshares. In contrast, Amazon wentpublicatthe age ofthree, Alphabetatsixand Facebookateight.Investorsrationalise itsvaluation byassumingthatin the longrun itwill be highlyproﬁtable, with a dominantshare ofa largemarket. In 2014 Bill Gurley, a well-known tech investorwho wasthen an Uberdirector, estimated thatthe pool ofconsumerspendingthatitcould tryand capture mightbe over$1trn, withride-hailingand ride-sharingreplacingcarownership. TodaymanySilicon Valleytypesthinkthatestimate istoo conservative.Buta discounted cashﬂowmodel givesa sense ofthe leap offaith thatUber’svaluation requires. Afteradjustingforits netcashof$5bn and foritsstake in Didi, worth $6bn, youhave to believethatitssaleswill increase tenfold by2026. Operatingmarginswould have to rise to 25%, from about-80% today.Thatisa huge stretch. Admittedly, Amazon and Alphabet, twoofhistory’smostsuccessful ﬁrms, both grewtheirsalesat leastthatquicklyin the decade aftertheyreached Uber’slevel, and Fa-cebookislikelyto aswell. Butoverthe same periodsthese ﬁrms’operatingmarginsshowan total average rise ofonlyone percent-age point. Putsimply, Uberﬁndsitdesperatelyhard to make mon-ey. Itisnotclearthatitbreakseven reliablyacross the group ofcit-ieswhere ithasbeen active forlongest. So the newchiefexecutive will have to delivera bleak mes-sage; thatride-hailingislocked in a viciouscircle. Low pricesandhigh subsidieslead to losses, so ﬁrmsmustraise capital contin-ually, requiringthem to exhibitrisingvaluations. To justify thesetheymustfrequentlyenternewcitiesand dream up newpro-ducts. Even more speculative capital isthen drawn in by the pa-pergainsseeminglyon oﬀer. In the pastyear, ten ofUber’scom-petitors, such asLyftin America and Grab in South-East Asia,have togetherraised orare raising, roughly$11bn. Thatwill beused to ﬁnance still more price warsto win marketshare.Double, double toil and troubleUberison course to use up itsexistingcash and credit linesinthree years. Itsnextbossmustbreakthe cycle before then bycut-tingsubsidiesand talkingdown itsvaluation. Itcould lose marketshare and mayneed to exitscoresofcities. On July13th itsaid thatitwill merge itsoperationsin Russia with a competitor. Similardealsneed to follow. Although Ubershould continue to invest indriverlesscars, some ofitsmore experimental “moon shot” pro-jectswill probablybe forthe chop. Itsinvestors, including Gold-man Sachs, Saudi Arabia’sgovernmentand Jay-Z, a rapper, couldface paperlosses. Staﬀpaid in stockwill be furious.Yetovertime the aim should be a ﬁrm with a lowermarketshare ofa more stable industry. Successful, dominantﬁrms, suchasGoogle and AT&T, don’tseekabsolute monopoliesbykillingoﬀweakerrivals. Theyallowthem enough space to plod on. Thatlowersthe riskofantitrustproblemsand detersnewentrants. BysignallingthatUber’svaluation istoo high itsnewbosswouldknockvaluationsacrossthe ride-hailingindustryand slow theﬂood ofspeculative capital—in the end, a good thing.Once the lossesabate, the priorityshould be to create a more“capital light” model. PerhapsUbercould license itsbrand andtechnologyto local partnersin some markets. Itcould concen-trate subsidieson customerswho sign up to long-term contracts.The biggestimpedimentmaybe MrKalanick. With allies, he stillcontrolsa signiﬁcantshare, probablya majority, ofthe com-pany’svotingrights. Anyone takingon tech’stoughestjob musthave the innersteel to confronthim. Theyshould remember an-otherquote from the bard; “I mustbe cruel onlyto be kind.”7ReinventingUberAn action plan forthe ride-sharing ﬁrm’s nextchiefexecutiveSchumpeterThe EconomistJuly22nd201755For daily analysis and debate on economics, visitEconomist.com/economics1ACCORDINGto companylore, YunnanBaiyao, a musty-smellingmedicalpowder, played a vital role duringthe LongMarch.

The company, previouslyownedbythe south-western province ofYunnan,sold a 50% stake to a private investorearlierthisyear. The same ﬁrm had tried to buyaslice ofYunnan Baiyao in 2009 butwasblocked. Itssuccessthistime hasbeen heldup in the oﬃcial pressasproofthat a pushto overhaul sluggish state companiesis atlastgainingmomentum underXi Jinping,China’spresident.Butformanyinvestorsand analysts, theYunnan Baiyao case provesjustthe oppo-site: thatSOEreformsare stuckin a rut. Thesale, afterall, lefthalfthe company in statehands. And a traditional Chinese medicalpowderisfarremoved from industriessuch asenergyand ﬁnance, which the gov-pand the Chinese economybynearly10%,orabout$1trn, overthe nextdecade.The fate ofChina’sstate ﬁrmsisalso aglobal concern. Byinternational stan-dards, theyare alreadymassive. China’s200 biggestSOEsaccountfor18% ofglobalrevenuesofintegrated oil and gascompa-nies, 6% in carmakingand 5% in construc-tion (see chart2). Aseriesofmega-mergerscurrentlyunderwayisconcentratingevenmore powerin the handsofa few, givingthem the heftto barge into newmarkets.Forforeign ﬁrmsthiscan smackofunfaircompetition, asiftheyare ﬁghtingagainstthe Chinese state. The temptation for othercountriesto blockforeign investments bySOEswill onlyincrease, settingthe stageforbitterdisputes.MarketfailureBackin 2013 MrXi seemed to grasp thatchange wasneeded. He vowed thatmarketforceswould playa “decisive role” in allo-catingresourcesand declared thatreformofSOEswasa priority. Although a big-bangprivatisation wasneveron the cards, thehope wasthatthe governmentwouldmake SOEsbetterrun, more competitiveand lesscoddled. There hasbeen a bewil-deringarrayofdirectivesand pilotpro-grammessince then butlittle real progress.The fearisthatthe reforms, taken together,notonlyfail to solve the mostpressing pro-blems, butmighteven be aggravatingthem. SOEsare gettingbigger, notsmaller;theirmanagementhasbecome more con-servative; and theirdeﬁcienciesare begin-ningto infectthe economymore widely.Keepingtrackofall the diﬀerent experi-mentsthatfall underthe headingof“SOEreform” isa full-time job. When MrXi putiton the agenda in 2013, the governmentbroke itdown into 34 separate initiatives,farmed outto diﬀerentdepartmentsandagencies. Ithassince published atleast 36 ernmentdeemsstrategicand islesswillingto open to private capital.Itishard to overstate the importance ofgettingSOEreformsright. In the 1980s,when China wasstartingto open to theworld, the state sectordominated its econ-omy, accountingfornearlyfour-ﬁfths ofoutput. Abigfactorbehind China’sre-markable growth since then hasbeen therelative decline ofSOEs, to the pointthattheyaccountforlessthan a ﬁfth of outputtoday. Asstate ﬁrmsstood still, a vibrantprivate sectorsprouted around them.Overthe pastfewyearsthe state sectorhas, byseveral measures, stopped shrink-ing. There are still more than 150,000SOEsin operation, two-thirdsowned bylocalgovernmentsand the restundercentralcontrol. Private ﬁrmsare much more pro-ductive, butstate ﬁrmsgobble up a dispro-portionate share ofresources. Theytakeabouthalfofall bankloansand are themain culpritsbehind China’sbigincreasein corporate debt. Since 2015 investmentbySOEshasgrown fasterthan private-sectorinvestment, reversinga decades-longtrend(see chart1on nextpage).ForChina thishasthe makingsof a da-magingcycle. Asgrowth slows, the govern-mentleanson SOEsto spend more; butthisdrivesup theirdebtfurtherand so weighson the economy. Puttinga stop to this se-quence isvital forChina ifitisto becomewealthy.

Provincesand citieshave followed up with dozens ofplans, guidelinesand trialsoftheir own.Some promisingideasare afoot. Afteryearsofdiscussion, China hasstarted to letstate ﬁrmsaward sharesto employees aspartoftheirpaypackages. SOEshad triedsuch schemesin the 1980sand 1990s, butthe governmentstopped them, fearingthatseniorexecutiveswere siphoningoﬀstateassets, much like Russia’soligarchs.Shanghai International PortGroup(SIPG), a city-owned ﬁrm, isone of thecompaniespioneeringemployee owner-ship ofshares. Italso demonstrateshow lo-cal SOEs, though smallerthan theirnation-al peers, are often huge themselves:SIPGisthe principal operatorofShanghai’scargoport, the world’sbusiest. In June 2015, asaﬁrststep, itallocated 1.8% ofcompanysharesto employees; some 16,000 ofits22,000 employeesnowhold a stake. DingXiangming, vice-presidentofthe portgroup, believeshe isalreadyseeingresults.“Workersare more focused on ourcom-pany’sgrowth,” he says.Publicand privateShanghai isalso an example ofhowpartsofthe countrycan outpace othersin SOEreform. LastAugustthe People’sDaily, theCommunistParty’smain newspaper,hailed the cityasa model forotherlocalgovernments. Shanghai moved quicklytoclassifyitsSOEsaseithercommercial (eg,SAIC Motor) orin publicservice (eg, Shang-hai Metro). Thisisa distinction that the cen-tral governmentwantsto see applied na-tionwide, so thatcompaniesclassiﬁed ascommercial can be treated more like priv-ate ﬁrms. Shanghai’scommercial SOEshave more leewayto hire managersfromthe private sectorand to paymarketrates.Anotherpotentiallypromisingidea is“mixed-ownership reform”, a fancytermforallowingSOEsto sell stakesto privateinvestors, asin the case ofYunnan Baiyao.The thinkingisthatprivate shareholderswill demand more from SOEs, especially iftheirinvestmentiscombined with a seaton the board. Asa conceptitisnotnew:manybigSOEshave been listed on thestockmarketsince the early2000s, attract-ingoutside investors. ButCao Zhilong ofShanghai United, a lawﬁrm, thinksthisround ofmixed-ownership reform couldlead to biggerdeals: “The word privatisa-tion isnotused. Itistoo sensitive. Butthestate can sell a majority.” Atnational level, the mixed-ownershiptrialshave been disappointing. The state ismainlysellingminoritystakesin the sub-sidiariesoflarge groups, such asa 45%share in the logisticsarm ofChina EasternAirlines, a deal completed in June. But forlocal SOEs, outrightsalesare easier. Tuopai,asmall town in Sichuan, sold a majoritystake in itsstrugglingliquorcompany to aChinese private-equityﬁrm lastyear. Thechange in culture isalreadyapparent. Thecompanyhasrolled outslicknewadvertsand usesdesignerbottlesinstead ofthe oldoneswith ill-ﬁttinglabels. Ithasalso cutabouta third ofproduction staﬀto makewayformore automation, the kind ofun-populardecision thata government-owned companyisloth to make.In general, though, such dealsare rare.Thiscannotjustbe blamed on the govern-ment; a basicdynamicisalso atwork.“ProﬁtableSOEsdon’twantto sell to out-sidersand no one wantsto buya strugglingSOE,” saysHongLiangofEverbrightLaw.Whatcan be blamed on the govern-mentare conﬂictingmessages. Lessnotedatthe time ofMrXi’s2013 pronouncementaboutmarketforces, butmore glaring now,washisdeclaration thatSOEsshould con-tinue to playa dominantrole in the econ-omy. The implication isthathe wants stateﬁrmsto be betterrun—hence the emphasison the market—butonlyso thattheybetterserve the partybyhelpingitto manage theeconomyathome and carryChina’sﬂaginto foreign territory. MrXi hasmade thispointin increasinglystridentterms. AtameetingonSOEslastOctoberhe devotedhiscommentsnotto reform butto the ne-cessityofstrengtheningthe party’sgrip.“The party’sleadership ofSOEsisa majorpolitical principle, and thatprinciple mustbe insisted on,” he said.People who workin and with SOEsre-porta palpable change in atmosphere inrecentyears. “Partyoﬃcialsare notthesame asthe technocratswho used to runtheSOEs,” saysa top banker. “Theydon’ttake risks. Doingnothingiswhat’ssafe.”Some ofthe mostcapable employeesareleavingSOEsaltogether. Political educa-tion, alwaysa partoflife in state ﬁrms, hasbeen stepped up. One managerwho re-centlyquita bigstate banksaid that a cam-paign exhortingworkersto studythe partyconstitution had been unusuallyintense.Atthe same time the governmenthascapped payforseniorexecutives, con-cerned thattheywere gettingmore thangovernmentemployeesofequivalentranks, stokingresentment. Yeton an inter-national basis, SOEbossesare dramatical-lyunderpaid. The presidentofPetroChina,the country’sbiggestoil company, earned774,000 yuan ($112,000) in 2016; the CEOofChevron, a ﬁrm ofroughlythe same mar-ketvalue, pulled in a handsome $24.7m.Signssuggestthatafterseeingmoralesuﬀerwithoutanyimprovementin perfor-mance, the partyisrethinkingatleast someofitspolicies. Asenioroﬃcial in charge ofsupervisingSOEssaid in June thatitwouldbe wise to delegate powerto companyboards, givingthem more sayoverlong-term planningand hiringdecisions. Li Ke-qiang, China’sprime minister, told a meet-ingof100 leadingexecutivesin April thatthe governmentmighttryto implement asystem ofperformance-linked payatbigstate ﬁrms. Ata conference on July15th, MrXi said itwasvital thatSOEsreduce theirexcessive debts(see chart3 on nextpage). ButMrXi’semphasison partyleader-ship hasalso created coverforthose seek-ingto defend and even expand state pow-er.

In a paperpublished earlierthisyear, CarolineFreund and Dario Sidhuofthe Peterson In-stitute ofInternational Economics, a think-tank, argued thatbusinessesaround theworld were operatingin more fragmentedenvironments, with the exception ofsec-torsin which Chinese SOEshave large foot-prints. In these sectors, such asmining andcivil engineering, concentration hasin-creased asChina’sstate ﬁrmshave bulkedup. Normally, itisthe mostproductivecompaniesthatgrowthe fastest. China’sSOEs, bycontrast, are much lesseﬃcientthan theirinternational counterparts, evenwhen theyare growingmore quickly, ac-cordingto MsFreund and MrSidhu.The business ofstateThe savinggrace in the pastwasthat thevastmajorityofSOEbusinesswaswithinChina. Thatischanging: industriesfromconstruction to steel to railwaysare look-ingabroad. The “One Belt, One Road” strat-egy—the core ofMrXi’sforeign policy—hasmade foreign expansion an explicitpart oftheirmandate. The dangerisnotjust thattheywill elbowChinese private-sectorcompetitorsaside butthatin doingso, theywill provoke a backlash. Bigﬁrmsin othercountrieswill demand state backingin or-derto level the playingﬁeld. Foreign regu-lators, alreadywaryofChinese capital,will turn more hostile. The driftaway fromfree trade could easilygathersteam.Thisisnotthe onlyworry. One of thekeysto China’seconomicrise hitherto hasbeen itssuccessin restrictingthe sprawl ofstate ﬁrms. Theycontrol the commandingheightsofthe economy, from transporta-tion to power, buthave largelybeen con-ﬁned to these sectors. Hard-charging entre-preneurshave been free to breakinto newbusinessesaround them. The manufactur-ersthatled China’sexportassaulton glo-bal marketswere private. The tech ﬁrmsthatdominate the internetare private. Therestaurants, cafésand shopsthatline citystreetsare private.Thismodel still works, fornow. Withinthe MSCIindexoflarge listed Chineseﬁrms, the state accountsformore than 80%ofmarketcapitalisation in sectorssuch asenergy, industryand utilities, according toMorgan Stanley. Butthe state accounts for40% orlessofmarketvalue amongcon-sumer, health-care and ITcompanies, saysthe bank. With these newersectorsgrow-ingfarmore quicklythan smoke-stack in-dustries, private companiesmaywell con-tinue to outﬂankSOEs.There isa bigloomingworry, however.One aspectofSOE reform isin factmakingquickprogress: the creation ofwhatareknown as“state capital investmentandoperation” companies(SCIOs), to helpmanage existingstate assetsand invest innewones. Thisinitiallylooked like part ofthe solution forChina. Itborrowsan ap-proach honed in Singapore, where Tema-sek, a government-owned holdingcom-pany, managesa portfolio ofstate ﬁrms butdoesnotmeddle in theiroperations, apartfrom demandingthattheydelivergood re-turns. Itisnowclearthatthisisnot whatChina hasin mind. GovernmentoﬃcialssaythatSCIOsshould notseekto makemoneyin theirinvestments; rather, theyare meantto be more like “policyfunds”,seedingﬁrmsand industrieswith govern-mentcash ormoneyraised from SOE divi-dendswithoutworryingaboutproﬁt.The otherstrikingfeature ofSCIOsisthattheyare expresslyenjoined to breakinto newhigh-tech sectors. Provincial gov-ernmentsaround the countryhave pub-lished plansoverthe pasttwo yearsinwhich theypromise to guide more than80% oftheirfundsinto infrastructure, pub-licservicesand, crucially, “strategicemerg-ingindustries”, a categorythatreferstonewenergy, biotechnologyandIT, amongotherareas. The upshotisthatSCIOs,armed with cheap capital, seem seton ex-pandingthe state’sreach into the privatesector. “We should anticipate the emer-gence ofliterallythousandsofwell-re-sourced SCIOs,” saysBarryNaughton atthe UniversityofCalifornia in San Diego.State-backed private-equityfunds,which can be seen asforerunnersto the in-vestmentfunction ofthe SCIOs, are al-readymakinga bigimpact. To give three ex-amplesfrom lastyear: the cityofShenzhenlaunched a 150bn yuan fund; Jiangxi, a rel-ativelypoorcentral province, created a100bn yuan fund; and the cityofChengdusetup a 40bn yuan fund. Thisinﬂuxofcash ispushingup valuations. Bain & Co, aconsultancy, calculatesthatprivate-equitydealsin China were priced lastyearat afrothy26-timesearningsbefore interest,tax, depreciation and amortisation, com-pared with ten timesin America. The statemayturn outto be a wise investorbut ex-perience suggestsotherwise. More likely,the state will crowd outprivate investors,hoggingcapital and allocatingitpoorly.The outcome doesnothave to be thisbleak. Optimistsstill thinkthatMrXi couldspringa surprise aftera bigCommunistPartycongresslaterthisyear. With his au-thorityﬁrmlyentrenched, he mightfeelemboldened to unleash the marketforcesthathe spoke offouryearsago. Butbasedon hisrhetoricand actionsso far, this lookslike wishful thinking. SOEs, farfrom re-treating, are on the march, drawingon gov-ernmentsupportto compensate fortheirweakness. Theyare makingconquestsathome and abroad. Cuttingstate ﬁrmsdown to size and openingthem up to com-petition oughtto be the pointofSOE re-form. Instead, China isbeeﬁngthem upand drivingthem into newterritory. 73Borrowing bingeSource: Wind InfoChina, companies’ liabilities as % of equity1001201401601802003050709111315Non-state-controlledState-controlledCan anything cure China’s SOEs?58FinanceandeconomicsThe EconomistJuly22nd20171THE mostrecenttime MosesKibetBie-gon needed a quickloan waswhen hisroofblewaway.

Since 2005, the worstmonth forre-demptionsin thissectoroccurred inOctober2008, when outﬂowsreached theequivalentof1% ofassetsundermanage-menteach week. The sell-oﬀwasaccom-panied bya rise in bond spreads—the gapbetween the yield on investment-gradebondsand thaton governmentdebt—ofaround a percentage point. Some ofthatincrease wasobviouslycaused bya deterioration in the economy—investorsrealised thatbond issuersweremore likelyto default. Butthe bankreckonsthataround halfthe shiftwasthe result ofadecline in liquidity. In otherwords, bondinvestorsdemanded a higheryield to com-pensate them forthe diﬃcultytheymightface in sellingtheirholdings.The bankreckonsthat, ifa 1% outﬂowofmutual-fund assetshappened today, thenEuropean investment-grade spreadswould rise, forliquidityreasonsalone, byaround four-tenthsofa percentage point.Thatmaynotsound much, butitisaroundathird ofthe average spread since 2000.Whatifthe sell-oﬀisgreaterthan itwasin 2008?

The fortunesofextremistcandidateshave faltered since the populistsurge thatputDonald Trump intothe White House.

Studiesshow thatthevote sharesofextreme parties, particularlyon the right, tend toincrease in the yearsaftera crisis. The Depression spawned someofthe 20th century’smostdangerousand radical populistmove-ments. Butthe factsdo notﬁtthatstoryprecisely. In Europe, forex-ample, populistpartieshave steadilywon more voterssince the1980s. Whatismore, populistrage israrelyfocused on ﬁnance.Trade and immigration are more prominenttargets. The clearestrecentmanifestationsofthe populistsurge—MrTrump’svictoryand Brexit—have onlyan indirectlinkto the ﬁnancial crisis.Rival theoriesblame populism on deep cultural insecuritiesprompted bydemographicand social change. In a forthcomingpaperNoam Gidron and PeterHall reckon thatright-wing politi-cal successisbuilton a decline in the subjective social statusofwhite men. Both economichardship and relative improvementsin the perceived statusofothergroups, such aswomen and racialminorities, seem to contribute to male insecurity. Around 2010American women withouta college degree overtooksimilarlyeducated men when both self-assessed theirplace in the socialhierarchy. Men’sperception oftheirrelative statushasalso fallenin Europe. The paperlinksdecliningstatusto supportfor right-wingpopulism. Yetthistoo seemsonlya partial explanation. Therecentrise in left-wingpopulism hasbeen justasstriking. Athird explanation iscaptured neatlyin a newpaper byDaniRodrikofHarvard University, who reckonsthatglobalisation’srole cannotbe ignored. He suggeststhatpopulism maybecomemore attractive asglobal integration matures.

The form ittakesdepends, however, on which sortofintegra-tion isthe greatestlocal irritant. Frustration with trade and ﬁnan-cial integration often breedsleft-wingpopulism, which feedsoﬀclassdivisionsin society; Latin American populism tends to fallinto thiscategory. When immigration isseen asthe source ofdis-ruption, right-wingpopulism, which exploitsethnicorreligiousdivisions, ismore common. In Europe, forexample, populistshave been farmore hostile to the free movementofpeople thanto open trade. Butfaced with both sortsofintegration Europe hasproduced examplesofeach and America hassprouted compet-ingleft-wingand right-wingpopulistleaders.These hypothesesare plausible (and compatible). Butthey arestill incomplete. The rejection ofestablished elitesis perhapsthedeﬁningcharacteristicofa populistmovement, yetwhat isnotal-wayscleariswhymainstream partiesshould be so unresponsivein the face ofdiscord. In anothernewpaper, Luigi Guiso, HeliosHerrera, Massimo Morelli and Tommaso Sonno provide a cleverframeworkforansweringthatcritical question. Establishmentparties, theysuggest, cannotrespond to supporters’ concernsbe-cause oftheirrespectforinstitutional constraints, like the rulesofthe European Union, orbecause ofan unwillingnessto breaknormslike repayingsovereign debt. Butkeepingfaith with institutionscan mean lettingdown vot-ers. When elected leadersfail to deliverhoped-forimprove-ments, the publicdisengages. Depressed turnoutisan opportuni-tyforpolitical entrepreneurs. Almostinvariably, the authorsargue, populistspromise to relieve the stressescaused byinstitu-tional constraints. Butthe genre ofpopulism dependson howturnoutvariesin some groupscompared with others. Ifright-wingvoters(such asoldermen) are lessprone to sitout elections,then a populistcandidate ismore likelyto be right-wing. Populistpoliciesvaryasa result: a left-wingﬁrebrand mightattack thebudgetstricturesimposed byEuropean institutions, whereas aright-wingermightfocuson endingfree movementoflabour.Ifthere isanythingthatunitesthe policiesofMrTrump withBrexitand the beliefsofEuropean populists, itisa promise tobreakfree ofconstraints. Buta populistupswingpropelled byun-happinesswith established institutionsraisesan awkward ques-tion: ifthese institutionsare worthwhile, whyare people so frus-trated bythem? The authorsargue thatpopulistshighlight theshort-run advantagesofwreckinginstitutionswhile downplay-ingthe long-run consequences. Thatcertainlydescribes thespendthriftrecklessnessofHugo Chávezin Venezuela. To somedegree, “populism” isanotherword forheterodoxiesthatseemdoomed to fail.Idemand satisfactionPoliticiansare shackled byall mannerofthings—from interna-tional institutionsand the whimsofcapital marketsto ideologi-cal commitmentsto particulartheoriesofeconomicgrowth.Such constraintsare notalwayssensible—thinkofthe unforgiv-ingfettersofthe gold standard, forexample. Butthey are oftenvaluable and workingoutwhich do more harm than good is rare-lyeasy. Unhappyvotersputall ofthem atrisk, however. And ifpoliticianscannotsatisfydisenchanted citizenswhile operatingwithin established limits, then institution-smashingpopulistswill soon be on the march again.7Take back controlWhen elites appearpowerless to help, voters give populists a chance Free exchangeEconomist.com/blogs/freeexchangeThe EconomistJuly22nd201761For daily analysis and debate on science andtechnology, visitEconomist.com/science1ITISlife’slottery, blessingsome and curs-ingothersin equal number: the chanceofa sexuallyreproducingorganism’soﬀ-springinheritinga particularversion ofagene from a particularparentis50%.

Ifthe propa-gatingvariantmade female mosquitoessterile, itmightprovide a meansto elimi-nate the troublesome insectsthemselves.Engineeringgene drivesto do human-ity’sbiddingin thiswayproved, however,devilishlydiﬃcult. The idea therefore lan-guished until 2015, when Valentino Gantzand Ethan Bierofthe UniversityofCalifor-nia, San Diego, used CRISPR-Cas9, a recent-lydiscovered gene-editingtool, to make agene drive thatcould be inserted any-genes, and a piece ofRNA, a chemical akinto DNAthatismade up ofsimilargeneticletters. This“guide”RNAwill stickonly to asection ofDNAwith a letter-sequencecomplementaryto itsown. The enzyme isbound to the guide RNA. The guide RNAisbound to the DNA. Hence the enzyme re-cognisesthe DNAithasto cut, and snips itatthe correctlocation. Byinserting thegene forCas9 into an organism, togetherwith geneticmaterial thatinstructsa cell toproduce the correctguide RNA, biologistscan therefore use CRISPR-Cas9 to severagenome ata speciﬁcpoint. Theycan then insertatthatpoint what-everpayload ofothergenestheymightlike—to modifymosquitoesso theycannottransmitdiseases, say—knowingthatthecell’sDNA-repairmechanismswill subse-quentlykickin to repairthe incisionaround the newlyinserted genes.

To use itasa gene drive,all thatisrequired isto include in the pay-load the genesforthe CRISPR-Cas9 systemitself, and to ensure thatsome copies getin-serted into an organism’sgerm cells—thosethatdevelop into sperm oreggs. This willmean thatthe gene drive ispassed on to allofthatorganism’soﬀspring.CRISPR-Cas9 gene driveshave, though,asigniﬁcantdrawback. When the drivecutsthe genome butfails, forsome reason,to insertitselfinto the incision, the cell in-stead insertsnewgeneticlettersto replacethose cutawaybythe enzyme before it re-joinsthe severed DNAstrands. Thispro-cessoften changesthe lettersequence atthe site. Thatmeansthe guide RNAcan nolongerrecognise it. And that, in turn,meansthe organism (and itsprogeny) arenowresistantto the drive. where in a targetgenome thattheychose.Those ﬁndingssparked concernsaboutthe eﬀectsgene-drive-carryingorganismscould have iftheywere everto be releasedinto the world.

To do so, he and hiscolleagues ob-served the eﬀectsofintroducinga CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive theyhad developed intofruitﬂies—insectscommonlyused in genet-icstudies.Theirdrive’spayload wasa gene thatencodesred ﬂuorescentprotein, a sub-stance normallyfound in a speciesof seaanemone. Byfurthergenetictweaking, theresearchersarranged forthisprotein to beexpressed, in particular, in the insects’eyes. Theythusknewthatﬂieswith ﬂuo-rescenteyescarried theirgene drive. Also,the guide RNAtheyselected meantthedrive inserted thispayload into the middleofa gene named “yellow”, thusdisruptingthatgene’saction. Flieswhich inherit a de-fective version of“yellow” have yellowbodies, ratherthan blackones. Afterexperimentswith thousandsofﬂies, DrMesserand histeam found that thegene drive successfullyinserted itself intothe insects’ DNAabouthalfthe time, pro-ducingﬂieswith ﬂuorescenteyesand yel-lowbodies. The otherhalfofthe insectsnearlyall had yellowbodies, butdid nothave ﬂuorescenteyes. ThatindicatedCRISPR-Cas9 had cutthe DNAin the rightplace, thusdisruptingthe function of “yel-low”, buthad failed to insertitself into theincision. Sequencingthe genomesoftheseﬂiesconﬁrmed thatin virtuallyall casesthe consequence wasa mutation thatren-dered the ﬂies(and would have renderedanyoﬀspring) resistantto the gene drive.Red signalThe team then repeated theirexperimentswith fruitﬂylinesfrom ﬁve continents.Theyfound thatthe proportion ofﬂies be-comingresistantto the drive varied fromabout60% down to 4%. Diﬀerencesin resis-tance to the drive were notcaused by anyinitial diﬀerencesin the targetsequence.Thatdid notvarybetween the ﬁve lines.Theymusttherefore have stemmed fromother(asyetunknown) geneticdiﬀerencesbetween the ﬂies. Thisisa worrybecause itsuggeststhateven ifa drive workswell inlaboratoryanimals, itmayfail in the wildwhen itencounterspopulationswith high-erresistance. Gettingto the bottom of whatiscausingsome linesto be more resistantthan otherswill be an importantstep to-wardsthe developmentofgene drivesthatcan spread traitsthrough a species, DrMesserreckons.Two furthermodiﬁcationsofCRISPR-Cas9 gene drivesmayhelp. The ﬁrst istoequip them with several guide RNAs, al-lowingCas9 to cutchromosomesatmorethan one place. An organism would haveto develop resistantDNAsequencesatallofthese to become fullyimmune to thedrive. DrMesserand hiscolleagueshavemade such a drive, containingtwo guideRNAs, and have found thatitdid indeedlowerthe proportion ofﬂiesthatdevel-oped resistance—though estimatesmadewith computermodelssuggestthisisstillnotenough forthe drive to reach morethan abouthalfthe population. The second approach isto putthe driveinto the middle ofa gene that, unlike “yel-low”, an organism needsto survive. Thismightbe expected to disruptthe gene andkill the organism. Butifthe inserted DNAhas, atone end, a replica ofthe part ofthedisrupted gene thathasbeen displaced bythe insertion, thiscan meld seamlesslywith itscounterpartin the animal, preserv-ingthe gene’sfunction and Cas9’sabilityto recognise it. Ifthe join isnotseamless,though, the gene will fail and the animalwill die. Mutantgenesresistantto the drivewill thusbe unable to spread.

Apaperpublished two yearsago in Naturefound a correlation between people’ssense ofwell-beingand the “scenicness”ofwhere theylived. The paper’sauthorsmeasured scenicnessbyaskingvolunteersto playan online game called Scenic-or-Not, which invitesparticipantsto look atphotographsofneighbourhoodsand ratetheirscenicvalue on a scale ofone to ten. The correlation, the paper’sauthorsfound, held true whethera neighbour-hood wasurban, suburban orrural. It boreno relation to respondents’ social and eco-nomicstatus. Nordid levelsofairpollutionhave anyinﬂuence on it. The authors alsodiscovered thatdiﬀerencesin respondents’self-reported health were betterexplainedbythe scenicnessofwhere those respon-dentslived than bythe amountofgreenspace around them.Pinningdown whatscenicnessactuallyis, though, hasalwaysbeen a frustrating ex-ercise forscientiﬁctypes.

The summerof 821waswet, cold and yielded a poorhar-vest. Then wintercame. Temperaturesplunged. Blizzardssmothered townsandvillages. The Danube, the Rhine and theSeine—riversthatneverfroze—froze sohard thatthe ice coveringthem could becrossed notjuston footbutbyhorse andcart. Nordid springbringrespite. Terriblehailstormsfollowed the snow. Plague andfamine followed the storms. The nextfewwinterswere worse. Fearstalked the land.PaschasiusRadbertus, a monkofCorbie, inwhatisnownorthern France, wrote thatGod Himselfwasangry. Yetitwasnot Godthatwroughtthisdestruction, according toUlfBüntgen ofthe UniversityofCam-bridge, butrathera volcano nowcalledKatla, on whatwasthen an unknown is-land, nowcalled Iceland.Atthe momentKatla, one ofIceland’slargestvolcanoes, located nearthe island’ssouthern tip, sleepsbeneath 700 metresofice. Ithasso slept, albeitﬁtfully, foralmost100 years. Itslasteruption bigenough tobreakthrough the ice wasin 1918. Ascore ofsuch ice-breakingawakeningshave beenrecorded byIcelanderssince the ﬁrstNorsemen settled there in 870. In 821, how-ever, Iceland wasnoton the Norsemen’shorizon. Theywere concentratingtheir ac-tivitieson the lootable monasteriesandvillagesofcoastal Europe. There isthus noman-made record ofwhatKatla wasup tothen. ButDrBüntgen thinkshe hasfound anatural one. Amemorandum ofan erup-tion thatcoincideswith the eventsde-scribed byRadbertusis, he believes, writ-ten in a prehistoricforest.Large volcaniceruptionscan aﬀect theweather. In particulartheyejectsulphurdioxide, which reactswith atmosphericgasesto form sulphate aerosolsthatreﬂectsunlightbackinto space, coolingthe airbe-neath. Thatiswell known. So the suspi-cion thatwhathappened in the early820swasprecipitated bysuch an eruption hasbeen around fora longtime. Thissuspicion isbacked up, moreover,byice corescollected in Greenland. Theseshowa spike in sulphate levelsin layerslaid down duringthose years. Butthe coresgive no hintofthe volcano’swhereabouts,because sulphatesfrom an eruption mixrapidlyinto the atmosphere and are soonspread evenlyaround Earth.Thingschanged, though, in 2003, whenﬂoodingexposed the forestwhich haspiqued DrBüntgen’sinterest. Preliminaryresearch suggested thatthe treesin it werealive duringthe 9th century. Thisled him toassemble a team ofphysicists, chemists, bi-ologists, historiansand geographersto in-vestigate the matter, startingwith an analy-sisofthe buried trees’ annual growth rings.In particular, the team searched forsignsofan ill-understood atomicmarkerfound in tree ringsofa certain age from allaround the world. Ringsthatgrewin 775,palaeobotanistshave found, contain 20timesthe normal amountofcarbon’smostcommon radioactive isotope, 14C. Thatyearisalso the date ofan enigmatic eventrecorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, acollection ofannalsdescribingthe historyofearlyEngland. Thisisthe appearance ofa“red cruciﬁx” in the heavensaftersunset.The bestmodern guessisthatthe Chroni-cle’swriterswere lookingatan unusuallypowerful manifestation ofthe northernlights, and thatthe high 14C levelsare a con-sequence ofthisisotope beinggeneratedabundantlyin the atmosphere byelevatedlevelsofsolarradiation, which also stimu-lated the auroras.DrBüntgen and hiscolleaguessearchedthe treesforthis14C spike—and theyfoundit. Astheyreportin Geology, the spike ap-pearsin ringsthatgrew47 yearsbefore theburial ofthe forest. Thatdatesthe cata-clysm which caused the burial to 822.The cataclysm itselfappears, from thedirection the knocked-overtreesare point-ingin, to have been a ﬂood resulting fromthe meltingand sudden rupturingofMyr-dalsjokull, the glacierthatoverlies Katla.Thisglacieris35km from the forest, so theﬂood in question musthave been enor-mous. The forest’sfate, combined with theice-core data from Greenland, suggestsKatla waseithereruptingin 822, orhaddone so recently, and thusweakened theglacier. Anyeruption ofsuﬃcientpower toprovoke such a ﬂood would also havebeen bigenough to precipitate a tempo-rarychange in the world’sclimate ofthesortthatRadbertusreports.Those ofNorse descentwho livedthrough the eventsofthe 820s, would not,ofcourse, have feared the angerofa godtheydid notbelieve in. Buttheymighthave feared theywere witnessingFimbul-winter—three summerlessyearsmarkingthe onsetofRagnarok, the twilightof theirown gods. Katla, however, ceased eruptingand both Ragnarokand the DayofJudg-mentwere avoided.

The exploitationofthe memoryofthe warhasbeen thecentral elementofmodern Russian ideolo-gy. ItiswhatmakesMsAlexievich’sworkso relevanttoday.7INJANUARY1488, BartolomeuDias, aPortuguese explorer, rounded Africa’ssouthern cape and putto shore to take onfood and water. There he found a group,smallerand lighter-skinned than the otherAfricanshe had encountered, who, mysti-ﬁed bythe odd men appearingoutoftheinﬁnityofthe sea, chased them back totheirboatundera hail ofarrows. The exchange, notesJamesSuzman inhisnewbook“Aﬄuence WithoutAbun-dance”, wasa meetingoftwo distantbranchesofthe human familytree: Euro-peansdescended from ancienttribesthatmigrated outofAfrica, and people com-monlyknown asthe San, who had calledsouthern Africa home foratleast150,000years. Justasimportant, the meeting repre-sented the collision ofhumanity’smostancientand durable form ofeconomicor-ganisation with itsmostpowerful. The lat-ter, wielded byEuropeans, hasdominatedthe halfmillennium since thatscrape onthe beach. Butmodern capitalistsocietiesmayhave somethingto learn from thewaysoftheirancientforebears.MrSuzman isan anthropologistwhohasspentyearsstudyingthe Bushmen ofthe Kalahari Desert: a San people related tothose who greeted Diason the beach,some ofwhom maintain the huntingandgatheringlifestyle thatsustained them for150 millennia. But“Aﬄuence WithoutAbundance” isnotsimplya description ofBushman life. MrSuzman deftlyweaveshisexperiencesand observationswith les-sonson human evolution, the historyofhuman migration and the fate ofAfricancommunitiessince the arrival ofEuro-peans. The overarchingaim ofthe book ismore ambitiousstill: to challenge the read-er’sideasaboutboth hunter-gathererlifeand human nature.Life spenthuntingand gathering, whileoccasionallytrying, wasnota tale of con-stanttoil and privation. Food could runshortduringdroughtsorannual lean peri-ods, butreliance on a broad range of foodsourcestypicallyaﬀorded such tribes a re-liable, well-balanced diet. Even around thearid Kalahari food isplentiful (atleastwhen the tribesare notforced to share theland with farmersand ranchers)—so muchso thatthe typical adultneed worklessthan 20 hoursperweek. The contrastwith farmingsocieties,which dominated historyafterthe domes-tication ofplantsand animalsabout10,000 yearsago, isstark. Farmed land ismore productive, which allowed the morepopulousfarmersto push hunter-gather-ersoﬀall butthe mostremote orinhospita-ble land. Butfarmingsocietiesdependheavilyon a fewstaples, leavingthempoorlynourished and vulnerable to cropfailure. Thathigh productivityalso tookendless, mind-numbingwork: to prepareand tend the ﬁelds, keep up the homesteadand defend the surplusesneeded to feedeveryone from one harvestto the next.MrSuzman arguesthatthe dramaticcultural shiftresultingfrom the adoptionofagriculture gave rise to impulsesthatpeople in modern rich countries, the heirsoffarmingsocieties, regard asnaturally hu-man—especiallythe insatiable desire to ac-cumulate. Farmingteachespeople to ac-ceptinequalityand to valorise work. Butforthe vastmajorityofhuman historythere waslittle pointin accumulating,since mostofwhatwasneeded could easi-lybe gotfrom the surroundingenviron-ment. Norwasthere anythingheroicaboutwork; spendingtime gettingmore foodthan one could eatwasa foolish waste. Modern San struggle to cope in a mar-keteconomy, thanksto thisheritage (and toanti-San bigotry). Employersstruggle tokeep them on the job: oﬀered higherwagestheyworkfewerhoursratherthan more.YetMrSuzman also reckons, afteryears ofstudyingthe Bushmen, thata world inwhich people workand worrylessispos-sible. Humanityspentmanymore thou-sandsofyearslivingthatwaythan work-ingitsﬁngersto the bone, afterall. Itisa nice idea. ButMrSuzman’sre-countingofrecenthistorymakesclear thatmodern life islike ridinga bicycle, in whichstoppingmeanstopplingover.

In thisghoulish massacre, witnessesreportedcrushed babies, disembowelled pregnantwomen and the burningofentire families.MrCampbell arguesthatthiswasa me-thodical eﬀortto wipe outEthiopian resis-tance to Italian rule, more like later Naziwarcrimesthan earliercolonial massa-cres. He chargesboth Graziani and the lo-cal FascistPartyleader, Guido Cortese,with personal responsibility. Though un-consciouswhen the killingbegan, Grazianitookcontrol ofthe subsequentreprisal exe-cutions, aimed in particularateliminatingthe Ethiopian nobilityand intelligentsia.Graziani wasneverprosecuted forcrimesin Africa, though he wasconvictedforcollaboration with the Nazisand brieﬂyimprisoned. Britain, waryofsettingawk-ward precedents, played an outsized rolein shelteringItalianswith blood on theirhands. MrCampbell citesa telegram writ-ten byWinston Churchill to hisambassa-dorin Rome in 1944, instructinghim to pro-tectMarshal Badoglio, Italian commanderofthe Ethiopian northern front, who usedpoison gas, and isconsidered the top warcriminal byEthiopia.Italywasneverforced to reckon withFascism asGermanywaswith Nazism.Fewpost-warItalian historiansevertack-led the massacre. Those thatdid were oftendenounced asunpatriotic. Angelo DelBoca, writingin the 1960s, wasaccused bythe Italian armyofbeinga “liar” forhisre-search on Graziani’scrimes.

ButnowmanyBritonssuspectthatBritish English islosing a warto the American kind. Aswith Revere’sride, itcan be hard to winkle outthe truth.In 2011the BBC published a broadsidebyMatthewEngel, citingﬁve commonAmericanisms, and invitingreaderstosend in theirown least-favourite ones.Theydid so with gusto, addingthat theseYankeeismsmade them “thoroughlydis-gusted” and the like. MrEngel had hitanerve, and lastmonth he published“That’sthe WayitCrumbles”, a bookbe-moaningthe Americanisation ofBritishEnglish. He isatpainsto saythat he isnotanti-American. He merelywantsto pro-tecthiscountry’sdistinctive dialect. Butin thatarticle from 2011, fourofﬁveofMrEngel’s“Americanisms” were, infact, ofBritish origin. So were many oftheonesreaderssentin. “Gotten”, one wrote,“makesme shudder.” Yetitisthe originalEnglish participle, replaced laterin Britainby“got”. “Fall” forautumn and “mad” forangry, too, were born in England, beforefadingthere in the earlymodern era. MrEngel ismore careful in the newbook topointoutsuch round-trippers.Itistrue thatAmerica isinﬂuencingBritish usage. “Smart” isincreasinglyde-scribingthe intelligentasmuch as thewell dressed. (Nevermind that“smart”ﬁrstwasused thiswayin Britain in 1571.)ManyBritonsprefer“movies” to “ﬁlms”.And “fries” and “cookies” are nowap-pearingalongside “chips” and “biscuits”.Butare theyalwaysreplacingthem?No: “smart” issavvy, whereas“clever”isswotty. “Fries” are thin and crispy, and“cookies” are American styleslike choco-late-chip, notesLynne Murphy, an Ameri-can linguistatSussexUniversitywritingherown bookaboutthe relationship be-tween British and American English.“Movies” tend to come from Hollywood;“ﬁlm” isstill preferred forthe latest grittycinema from Europe. In otherwords, theseAmericanismsare notan impoverishmentofBritish English. Theyare additions to it.The traﬃcgoesboth ways: “scones”,both the thingsand the word, have madetheirwayto America (though notthe pro-nunciation: mostAmericansmake itrhyme with “cones”). Ben Yagoda, anAmerican academic, keepsa website of“NotOne-OﬀBritishisms” used bystylishYanks, from “ginger” hairto “nick” for“steal”. MrEngel repliesthatthese are lim-ited to intellectualsin America. American-isms, he says, are takingdeeperroot amongordinaryBritons.English hasalwayssucked up wordsfrom around the globe. MrEngel’sfearisthatin the pasthalf-century, one sourcehascome to dominate: America, thanksto itscultural, technological and politicalheft. Buthe goeseven furtherin sayingthat, in a century, itispossible to imagine“American English absorb[ing] the Britishversion completely”. Thisis—to use anotherAmericanism—horsefeathers. American and British Eng-lish diﬀeron manylevels: spelling, pro-nunciation, vocabulary, style and gram-mar. MrEngel focuseson showingthatsome British wordsare givingwayto, ormakingroom for, American alternatives.Butthese are a fraction ofthe huge vocab-ularyotherwise shared bythe two dia-lects. Itiseasyto ﬁnd a newspaper articlein which nota single word (spelling aside)isdistinctlyBritish orAmerican. In otherdomains(recipesand car-parts, for exam-ple) diﬀerencesare frequent. Butthese do-mainsare local and personal, and highlyresistantto change. Overall, British English isin rudehealth. Pronunciation diﬀerencesaﬀectvirtuallyeveryword, and British pronun-ciation ishardlyconvergingon American.The fewgrammatical diﬀerences(for ex-ample “I will” in America, versus“I willdo” in Britain) showlittle sign ofchangingeither. There islittle appetite in Britain forAmerican spelling. And thatineﬀablequalityofstyle makesarticlesbyBritishorAmerican writersdistinct, even in theabsence ofobviousshibboleths.American inﬂuence on global (not justBritish) English isrising. Butvarieties fromIreland to India to Australia retain a clearidentity. Even within America, local dia-lects, especiallythe southern one, are go-ingstrong. All ofthese, and British Englishtoo, are constantlyinnovating. MrEngel isrightto dread a “linguisticmonoculture”.He iswrongto thinkthatitislikely.The Americanisms are coming!JohnsonButBritish English is being inﬂuenced, notdestroyed, bythe American sortthrough the lesselegantexpedientof jerry-rigged motors.

In high-incomecountries, where cigarettes are mostexpensive, taxes make up on average 65%of the total price.

Next, work out,on variouslyshaped tables, which set ofricochetswould merelyrepeata pattern,and which would eventuallycoverthewhole surface. Full answersare still elu-sive, butitisthe sortofmathematical puz-zle thatoutsiderscan atleastimagine. ByMaryam Mirzakhani’sstandards,such problemswere mundane. In herworld, the billiard tableswere abstract geo-metricobjectswhich stretched andwarped. The problemsinvolved notjustone table buta “moduli space”, ofall possi-ble such surfaces. Fanscalled herwork onthese mind-spinningabstractionsthe“theorem ofthe decade”. Until the joyofmathsclaimed her, shewanted to be a novelist. Bookscostnext tonothingin the Iran ofherchildhood, andherearliestambition wasto read every-thing. Later, hermathshad a literary tinge.She thrilled to the unfoldingplotlines inthe problemsshe studied—though unlikein literature, she said, theyevolved like livecharacters. “Justasyoustartgettingtoknowthem, youlookbackand realise yourﬁrstimpression ismistaken.” Byherown accountshe wasa “slow”mathematician, both in the time ittook herto getstarted (herﬁrstteacherin Tehranthoughtshe lacked aptitude) and in thewayshe approached problems: teasingoutsolutionsbydoodlingforhourson vastsheetsofpaper. These would swathe theﬂooroftheirhome, to the delightof hertoddler, and to the amused bewildermentofhertidy-minded Czech husband. Thepoint, she said, wasnotto write down allthe details, butto stayconnected with theproblem. She also likened mathematicalinquiryto beinglostin a forest, gatheringknowledge to come up with some newtricks, until yousuddenlyreach a hilltopand “see everythingclearly”.Butshe wasquickon otherfronts. En-couraged byherteachersand olderbroth-er, she soared through the Iranian educa-tion system. She wasthe ﬁrstgirl torepresentthe countryin the mathematicalOlympiad, winninggold medalsin twosuccessive years. Herbeloved abstract sur-facescan be described geometrically, withangles, lengthsand areas, oralgebraically,with equations. She wasﬂuentin both: amathematical polyglot. She found it“re-freshing” to crosswhatshe dismissed asthe “imaginary” boundariesbetween dif-ferentbranchesofthe subject. AfterHarvard and a stintatPrinceton,she ended up atStanford, winningtheFieldsmedal—broadlythe mathsequiva-lentofa Nobel prize—in 2014, the ﬁrstwoman to do so since itsinception in 1936.Herdoctoral thesisalone wasan academicearthquake, leadingto paperspublished inthe three most-admired mathematicaljournals. Ofhergreatbreakthroughs, per-hapsthe mosteasilyexplained involveshyperbolicsurfaces: roughly, doughnutswith two ormore holes, butwhere eachpointon the surface curvesupwards, like asaddle. These exist, in theory, in inﬁnite va-rieties. Abigpuzzle involves“geodesic”lines: the shortestdistancesbetween twosurface points. Some maybe inﬁnitelylong; othersare “closed”, formingloopswith no endpoints. Afascinatingand tinyhandful, known as“simple”, nevercrossthemselves. Herthesisrevealed a formulaforhowthe numberofsimple closed geo-desicsofa given length rose asthat lengthincreased. Such workmightseem abstruseto outsiders, butusesabound, from cos-mologyto cryptography.She belied stereotypes. To Americans,she had to explain thatin hernative Iran(unlike Saudi Arabia) women’seducationand careerswere notjusttolerated but en-couraged: hergirls’ high school wasrun byanational organisation responsible forhothousingyoungtalent. She wasnot onlythe ﬁrstwoman to win the Fieldsmedal,butthe ﬁrstIranian, makinghera celebritythere. Some media ﬂinched piouslyfromportrayingherwithouta headscarf, a ta-boo which frayed afterherdeath. Her mar-riage to a non-Muslim wasnotrecognised,hamperingfamilyvisits. Manyalso be-moaned heremigration, partofa debilitat-ingbrain drain. She moved to America forpostgraduate studyin 1999, a time when to-day’santi-Muslim immigration policieswere unimaginable. Drawing a lineShe quailed onlybefore the limelight. Sheignored a friend’se-mail tellingherof theFieldsaward, assumingitwasa practicaljoke. In remission from the cancerthatwould eventuallykill her, she worried thatchemotherapyhad lefthertoo weakto at-tend the awardsceremony.Men have roughlyﬁve in everysixmaths-heavyacademicjobsin America,partofa widerpuzzle thatneithernaturenornurture fullyexplains. One reasonmaybe thatmathstalentand female fertil-ityﬂowerin the same crucial years.
