history takes to the small screen
A string of successful television exports project soft power
GERMAN TELEVISION USED to be dominated by sentimental romantic dramas and worthy but dry documentaries. But a succession of innovative new series is now taking the culture world by storm. In 2015 the first episode of “Deutschland 83”, a spy thriller set in former East Germany, was the most watched subtitled programme ever to air on British television; a sequel, “Deutschland 86”, will hit screens later this year. Now reviewers are raving about “Babylon Berlin”, a Weimar-era crime drama that has been described as “ ‘Cabaret’ on cocaine”.

Deep-pocketed American studios are working with German writers and actors to make television aimed at global markets. “Babylon Berlin”, the costliest non-English-language series ever made, was half-funded by Sky, a European media group, and distributed by Netflix, an American entertainment company, which in December produced its own first German-language series—“Dark”, a science-fiction thriller. Amazon, an online giant, did the same last year with the Berlin-based “You Are Wanted”, a series about the aftermath of a cyber-crime attack.

“When our series was popular in the US and the UK, Germans were surprised but I wasn’t,” recalls Anna Winger, one of the makers of “Deutschland 83”. Comfortable in its skin and blessed with a cool, creative capital city, Germany is now seen as sexy. In 2017 it overtook the United States to become the world’s most respected country, according to an annual survey of 50 nations by GfK, a market-research firm. Its long-undigested past is at last considered suitable material for television programmes.
