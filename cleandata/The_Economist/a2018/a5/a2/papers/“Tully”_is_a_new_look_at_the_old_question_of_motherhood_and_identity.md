The ever-changing Argonauts

“Tully” is a new look at the old question of motherhood and identity

J

IT WAS Plutarch who first mulled over the question. If an object has been restored, each and every piece replaced over time, does it remain the same original object? The idea, known as Theseus’s paradox, has occupied modern writers as much as antiquarian ones. It looms over 

, and other coming-of-age novels. It is the guiding theme of “The Argonauts”, Maggie Nelson’s memoir of motherhood, marriage, gender and writing (the title is itself a reference to Roland Barthes’s ruminations on the thought experiment, which centre on a wooden ship 

). Through Ms Nelson’s book, the 

 now lands at the heart of “Tully”, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody’s new film, which explores the changes both cognitive and bodily that motherhood brings. When being a mother dominates, leaving no room for things you once enjoyed or cared about, is that an erasure of self, or the development of it?  

The film opens on Marlo (Charlize Theron), days away from having her third child. Her son, Jonah, is somewhere on the autism spectrum and struggling in kindergarten; the staff argue that he needs to be moved to a special-needs school. His care requirements demand a lot of time and attention, and neither Marlo nor her husband, Drew (Ron Livingston) seems to have much capacity for their eight-year-old, Sarah. 

When Craig (Mark Duplass), Marlo’s affluent brother, offers to pay for a night nurse for the first month after the new arrival, she is reluctant to accept the offer. She fears she will miss out on essential bonding time with her infant daughter. Drew would ideally help, but he works during the day and unwinds in the evening by playing videogames in bed. Here, motherhood is portrayed at its most hectic, and with gusto—a percussive montage of nappy bins, baby monitors and morning routines, all running against the clock. On a day that Jonah has a tantrum, uncontrollably kicking the driver’s seat, Marlo is worn out. She gives in and calls the nanny.  

There is something mysterious and dreamy about Tully (Mackenzie Davis), the 26-year-old night nurse who arrives full of optimism and energy. As Tully tidies up the house, bakes cupcakes and urges restful nights, Marlo soon realises how desperately she needed the help. She realises, too, that what sets their lives apart is joy. When the enigmatic nanny says “and so to bed” one night, a reference to Samuel Pepys’s signature sign-off, the film alludes to the feeling of waking up older every morning, holding on to the days which are gone. 

Yet the film avoids stereotypes and melodrama thanks to the remarkable performance of Ms Theron (a committed performance, too, as she gained a significant amount of weight for the film). Her post-partum presence as an exhausted, milk-leaking mammal is all the more compelling for her blank stare. Marlo has everything she once dreamed of, but still feels depleted.

This is the third film on which Mr Reitman and Ms Cody (“Juno”, “Young Adult”) have collaborated, and the outcome is once again vibrant and rich. The dialogue crackles with wit: when the two women are discussing relationships, Marlo compares those of her youth to “the horses in the carousel going up and down”, and her marriage to “the bench”. But the partnership between Marlow and Drew is of particular importance to Mr Reitman as it holds the middle ground. In the end, it is less a portrait of sleep-deprived mothers and the chaos wrought by a newborn than of the numbing effect of stability. 

“Tully” not only contains multitudes but forces some difficult questions. The concluding twist is nothing short of masterful (“I think there’s something lovely about a movie that slowly unveils itself to you,” Mr Reitman says). “If all the cells in your body change, are you still the same person?” Marlo asks while staring at the young woman’s flat stomach under her crop top. Mr Reitman and Ms Cody have created a moving film that shows what it means to age, change and yet still carry the person you used to be with you. The 

’s parts may get replaced, but it is still called the
