On bad artists, a tongue-tied Jordan Peterson, and helping the losers from free trade 

The latest news from the Open Future initiative

 Open Future initiative aims to remake the case for the values of individual freedom and free markets in the 21st century. Highlights from this week’s activities include: 

In recent weeks Junot Díaz has been accused of rudeness, allegedly tinged with misogyny, that chimes with the machismo he depicts in his stories. There is not, and can never be, a fixed rule for deciding what, in an artist’s biography, counts as disqualifying for his art. That being so, removing books from shelves or school curriculums is both mistaken and patronising. It may or may not deprive people of life-enriching art; it certainly deprives them of the chance to make up their own minds

The controversial author of "12 Rules for Life" and pundit of anti-political-correctness tells us what he thinks is wrong with modern liberalism in our podcast. We ask him about #MeToo, whether people should date their co-workers—and we endure an excruciating silence after asking which feminist he most admires.  

It is time to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. So says a new British parliamentary report, in a damning indictment on the Burmese government and Aung San Suu Kyi, its de facto leader. The report argues that the process of turning Myanmar into a democracy has proved illusory, and that the country is going backwards. The treatment of the Rohingya people bears all the hallmarks of a genocide. Those who were responsible  must be held accountable, and soon.

If we want to help globalisation, we'd better start helping those hurt by it, says Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mr Bernstein argues that the policy agenda should be guided by protection, not protectionism. Subsidised jobs, opportunity zones and patient capital can make a big difference.

What happens when freedoms collide? Can religious beliefs or freedom of speech ever be an excuse to deny service? Should businesses be forced to disseminate ideas with which they disagree, such as baking a cake for a gay wedding? Or should the law be used to overrule personal beliefs in order to fight discrimination? 

 Open Future initiative invited Peter Tatchell, a human rights activist, and Andrew Copson, the head of Humanists UK, to debate a motion that pits different aspects of civil liberties against each other. 

America's Supreme Court is weighing whether a bakery may lawfully refuse to sell a cake for a gay wedding. The case is an important reminder of why laws against discrimination matter, argues Ria Tabacco Mar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, in a  commentary for 

 Open Future initiative. The question isn’t whether wedding cakes are art or expression protected by the freedom of speech—it is whether a state can prevent the harms of discrimination against people because of who they are, she writes. 

Four Dartmouth College students debated the question in front of a live audience this week. The “pro regulation” side successfully argued in favour of imposing new rules on companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, in the interest of protecting people’s private data and encouraging competition and innovation in the tech sector. The winners also swayed about a quarter of the audience to change their vote and embrace their position over the course of the debate. “Government regulation is one thing that can unilaterally check the power of these companies”, argued Connie Lee, a senior at Dartmouth.
