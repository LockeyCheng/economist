 By Damian Le Bas. 

DAMIAN LE BAS is caught between two worlds. He grew up in a family of Romany gypsies. His great-grandmother used to regale him with tales of travellers and their ways. But he has non-gypsy blood, too, and has never lived a completely nomadic life; instead he won a scholarship to a private school and studied theology at Oxford University. Feeling adrift from his ancestry, Mr Le Bas takes to the road to rediscover some of Britain’s “stopping places”, old traveller campsites, and reconnect with the traditional ways.

In a Ford Transit van—a popular vehicle among British travellers—Mr Le Bas stays at stopping places of all stripes. He visits a secret gypsy church in a forest in Hampshire, the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria and a travellers’ wedding site in the Scottish highlands. More prosaic destinations include urban lay-bys and supermarket car parks. But he is at his best in nature. Even in drab landscapes, he conjures up soaring, poetic descriptions of his surroundings.

At first, life on the road comes as a shock. The nights are cold and noisy, and he fears the knock of policemen and other travellers on the side of his van. Gradually he grows accustomed to the distinct rhythm of a traveller’s day. His initial uncertainty about his identity is assuaged.

But “The Stopping Places” is more than a travelogue. It is also a colourful dive into gypsy culture, history and language. English Romani is used so frequently that the book includes a short glossary to help 

 (non-gypsies). The lexicon is telling. By his teens Mr Le Bas knew four words for “punch”, five for “money” and seven for “police”.

Other aspects of gypsy life are revealed. Joey Grey, a soup with an often-disputed recipe, is a culinary favourite. Haggling is customary and, once a deal is struck, a second negotiation takes place for “luck money”, a sum given back to the buyer for good fortune. Family disputes are often settled with a fight, ideally a fair one-on-one with a referee and no weapons.

On occasion the segues into gypsy anecdotes seem forced; the frequent narrative leaps can be disorienting. But these are small prices to pay for the book’s scope, from the arrival of Romanies in Britain in the late 15th century (from Rajasthan in north-west India, via continental Europe) to their modern customs. “The Stopping Places” is an enjoyable and enlightening account of an overlooked part of British society.
