THE result was predictable, but earth-shaking even so. On July 1st Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a charismatic populist, won Mexico’s presidency in the country’s first democratic landslide. His margin of victory suggests that his electoral coalition will control congress and the government of Mexico City, the capital, giving Mr López Obrador unprecedented power for a modern president. As in America and parts of Europe, an angry electorate has repudiated the established political elite. In Mexico’s case voters have elected an unpredictable leftist.

Mr Lopez Obrador, a 64-year-old ex-mayor of Mexico City who has run for the presidency twice before, came out on top of the election commissioner’s preliminary count, released shortly before midnight, with about 53% of the vote. His nearest challenger, Ricardo Anaya of the National Action Party (PAN), trailed far behind with 22%. José Antonio Meade of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) won a dismal 16%. The size of Mr López Obrador’s victory was not a surprise: he has led in the polls by double-digit margins since March. It suggests that his coalition, 

 (“Together we will make history”), will be able to form a congressional majority when results are tallied in the coming days.

That is an incredible turn of events in a country where political change has often come at a glacial pace. When the PRI lost power in 2000 after governing Mexico for 71 years, the PAN, founded six decades earlier, came in. But it did not change much, paving the way for the PRI’s return to office in 2012. Mr Obrador, who founded Morena, the main constituent of 

, as a party in 2014, has destroyed the political duopoly. He has been telling his followers that this is the most momentous occasion in Mexican history since the revolution that began in 1910.

AMLO, as Mr López Obrador is often called, has been rejected twice by Mexican voters, in 2006 and 2012. But a crime wave and countless scandals under the current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, have infuriated voters; the rise of social media has spread the outrage. The political campaign itself was plagued by violence: more than 120 politicians and political workers have been killed since last September.

Mexicans are more receptive than ever to Mr López Obrador’s message that a “mafia of power” is enriching itself at their expense. He told voters that he alone represents the people, that his opponents are illegitimate and that there is no difference between the two major parties. That argument was bolstered when the PRI selected Mr Meade as their candidate. He has been a minister under both PRI and PAN presidents.

An electoral drubbing of the PRI has long been in prospect. After a series of losses it will now govern just a dozen of Mexico’s 32 states. A party that has long trafficked in patronage now has little to offer. Its future may be bleak. The PRI’s place as the spinal column of political power may now be taken by Morena. “People will be studying this in Mexico for decades to come,” says Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC.

The PAN’s candidate, Mr Anaya, spoke of the need for change but seemed uncertain whether to defend three decades of technocratic government, which has delivered modest progress, unequally shared. The PAN, which suffered from infighting during the campaign, faces a tough rebuilding process.

What awaits Mexico now is uncertainty. Mr López Obrador is a conundrum, who can sound like a fiscally conservative pragmatist in one speech and a messianic rabble-rouser in the next. Mexicans cannot be sure which AMLO will turn up to work on December 1st, the day he is due to take office.

There is little doubt about what his first priority will be. Corruption, he wrote in a recent book, “2018: The Way Out”, is Mexico’s “principal problem”. In stump speeches he calls it a cancer that causes social division. Curing it, he promises, will bring prosperity to Mexico’s impoverished southern states and restore national dignity.

But just how Mr López Obrador will achieve this is, like much else about his presidency, unclear. He seems to believe that his own example of personal virtue will be enough. There is little sign that he has either the mindset or the patience to build the institutional framework needed to fight corruption effectively, for example by making prosecutors truly independent. Many of the civil-society groups that fight corruption are unenthusiastic about Mr López Obrador’s presidency.

On other issues there is even less certainty. The president-elect promises prudent budgeting and no tax increases, but also says he will freeze petrol and electricity prices and subsidise agriculture. His election adds an unpredictable new factor to negotiations over the future of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which includes the United States and Canada. Once a critic of NAFTA, Mr López Obrador now says he supports it. But his economic nationalism resembles that of President Donald Trump, which could make it harder to reach agreement on NAFTA.

Some Mexicans have been yearning for a president from the left ever since 1988, when Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas lost an early lead after a technical glitch in vote counting (his supporters claimed the election was stolen). The jubilation over AMLO’s victory will be deeply felt. But starting next year, voters will demand results rather than just rhetoric from their new president. As he now knows, Mexicans are not afraid to punish failure.
