Why the Beano is still beloved 80 years on

Its signature mischief, identifiable characters and steady evolution have resonated with children through the decades

LIKE much of Britain’s school-age population, your correspondent grew up in Beanotown. It was a land of glee, grub, burps and splats; of pranks, pies and catapults. It was a place where itching powder, stink bombs and dirty-face soap served as currency, and mud was something to be dived into headfirst.

The 

 hit newsagents’ stands with a wallop in the summer of 1938, on the eve of the second world war. It cost two pence (£1.30 today) and came with a free whoopee cushion (still a sure-fire way to make a child laugh). As it celebrates its 80th birthday on July 30th, the 

 is the country’s longest-running comic magazine for children. Though 

 over the decades, its longevity is testament to the skill of the writers who keep its young fan base hooked. According to Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios in Scotland, around 30m people alive in Britain have been regular 

 readers at some point.

The original cover stars were Big Eggo, an ostrich, and Biffo the Bear, both of whom still appear in the occasional strip. Dennis the Menace, Minnie the Minx, the Bash Street Kids and Roger the Dodger were all born in the 1950s. Nigel Parkinson, who has drawn Dennis and his pet dog Gnasher since 1997, credits this group of relatable characters with the 

’s continued success. “Until the 1950s, comics were all about animals, magic potions, heroic knights, tramps, cowboys and policemen,” he says. “Dennis has always been the urban kid trying to have a bit of free-form fun in a rule-bound, stern adult world.”

The characters have moved with the times. In the annual for 2015, for example, Dennis’s little sister Bea slept beneath a mobile made of mobile phones. Roger’s book of schemes has moved online with the help of a DodgePad, and football matches finish with a group photo via selfie stick. The 

 now exists in many mediums: it has its very own podcast, a website, the hashtag #SoBeano and CGI and live-action adventures on CBBC, a British television channel for children.

New members of the cast that reflect and celebrate the 

’s audience have been introduced too. Take Rubi, a brilliant inventor who also happens to be in a wheelchair, or sports-and-music-obsessed JJ, one of the comic’s first ethnic-minority characters. “The editorial staff are incredibly sensitive to changing cultural attitudes,” says Ned Hartley, who writes the Bananaman strips. “There has always been a real sense of ownership with the 

—that it belongs to the readers and that these characters are their friends.”

This evolution has been essential to the 

’s survival. Along with other print media, comics have been hit hard in recent years. Those marketed at children tend to have a short shelf life as tastes change rapidly across generations, and what people find funny dates as quickly as kids grow up. The 

 ran for 75 years—it was printed every other week alongside the 

 during the war—but was forced to close in 2013, faced with dwindling sales and failed attempts at rebranding. Anita O’Brien, the curator of London’s Cartoon Museum, agrees with Mr Parkinson that the 

’s characters are simply “edgier”. “A lot of their success hinges on how easily they can be updated,” she says, “and Desperate Dan [the super-strong, pie-eating cowboy who became the 

’s most recognisable personality] wasn’t as open to reinvention.”

Yet the 

 doesn’t stray too far what made it popular in the late 1930s. Short, picture-heavy strips are splashed with primary colours, different-sized panels and a variety of artistic styles, with some illustrators bringing manga-inspired drawing to the traditional format. It never patronises its fans linguistically: pages are strewn with wonderfully monosyllabic yelps and tee-hees, but also more sophisticated words and puns that encourage children to view language as playful rather than onerous.

The 

 ultimately holds sway because it is funny; the characters exist to amuse, not to moralise. “The laughs you get from a comic aren’t the same as those you’d have from an Internet meme,” says Vince Pavey, who writes the Ball Boy strips. The reader sees Billy Whizz, a boy who can run extraordinarily fast, at a charity car wash: he works so quickly he strips the paint off every vehicle. Over the page, Minnie’s mother sighs theatrically. “I wish I knew where your behaviour comes from,” she says, “I blame your father’s side...” Minnie takes to Google to find a family tree, and uncovers a childhood photo of Mum firing tomatoes around the playground.

In this way, the 

 celebrates children’s everyday preoccupations—climbing the tallest trees, tearing around with friends and avoiding homework—and doesn’t demand leaps of imagination. With its distinguishable brand of mischievous humour, the 

 is as relevant and immediately entertaining as it was when gleeful readers took home that first issue in 1938.
