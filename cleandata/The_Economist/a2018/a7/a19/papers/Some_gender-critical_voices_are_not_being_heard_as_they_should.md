Some gender-critical voices are not being heard as they should

The trans debate cannot be reduced to simple slogans, writes James Kirkup, in his second essay

This has been an excellent series, just the sort of serious, thoughtful debate that the issue needs. I’ve learned a lot, and more important than that, I’ve been left with more questions to which I don’t yet have answers; in other words, I’ve learned about more things that I don’t know. I can’t possibly capture all that here without straining the editor’s patience, so I’d like to offer thoughts on two points raised by others. 

 verdict on my initial piece is that I ignore or dismiss women who don’t take a “gender-critical” perspective on the trans issue; I am, apparently, someone who is, “happy to promote the voices of lesbians if they agree with him and oppose trans rights, but dismisses the voices of the large majority of lesbians who are allies of trans equality.”

I politely disagree with that characterisation—not least in its baseless suggestion that I “oppose trans rights”—but I don’t dismiss it. I think there’s a misunderstanding, though. I don’t for a second suggest that all women are gender-critical or otherwise ignore the fact that some women take a different view. But is it really necessary to state that women hold a variety of views? I’d hoped that could be taken as read. 

More narrowly, there’s another reason that I don’t always take pains to highlight the views of women who take that side in this conversation: I don’t think that doing so is an urgent necessity. Those “allies of trans equality” are already well served by vocal and eloquent organisations and political representatives; they have a voice in the public square that other women do not. 

Recent parliamentary debates on the transgender issue have demonstrated that politicians will queue up to proclaim their support for trans rights, something that can only be seen as positive. But those politicians (and I know a significant number) who see the need for better treatment of trans people at the same time as worrying about the potential impact on women and their legal rights are not so eager to speak. In those parliamentary debates, many chose to stay silent. 

That silence is symptomatic of the political failure that motivates me to write about this issue. Some voices are not being heard as they should. And please note that word “some” very carefully—it’s vital here, as elsewhere, that we recognise that people who share one characteristic can have differing views. 

Some people think one thing about this issue. Some people think another. I don’t mean to take sides in that argument, but I do think that one of those groups needs to be heard more clearly—which is why I write more about the “gender-critical” group than the “transwomen are women” group. But I don’t in any way deny that second group exists, or suggest they should not be heard. 

The essay here I found most affecting was by 

, who wrote with courage and honesty about her personal challenges. One point in particular stood out, when she wrote: “I came to realise that it wasn’t necessary to use blusher, eye shadow or lipstick to be a woman. It was about how I feel. That is why I get frustrated with those in the trans community who fixate on glamour, and with the media’s focus on trans models. That look objectifies women, and anyway, few can attain it.”

I think outward appearances warrant more careful thought, especially from those who make laws relating to gender. What does it mean to “live in a gender”? Too many answers seem to come back to clothing or make-up—outward presentation. But if gender is found in objects that can be picked up or put down, does the concept of gender have any deep meaning? More practically, if “woman” means “person who wears dresses and make-up”, what about those natal women who wear neither? If presentation is integral to gender, doesn’t logic demand that we ditch either sex or gender as classes and legislate for “people who wear trousers” and “people who wear dresses”? 

But what if, as Ms Brothers suggests, gender identity is entirely internal, about “how I feel”? Legislating for the things people think and feel is difficult, to say the least. Secular Western democracies have experience of using law and custom to respect people’s freedom to hold and profess religious faith. But questions remain. How much freedom must believers be given over the manner in which they express their faith? And should respecting another person’s right to feel and think something entail a requirement to accept those thoughts and feelings as correct?

I am not, to be clear, suggesting gender identity is perfectly analogous with religious faith. My point is that reconciling something inherently subjective with the objective standards on which law depends is extremely difficult and unlikely to be achieved neatly. Among other things, that means that anyone who suggests this debate can be reduced to simple and certain slogans either isn’t being honest or just hasn’t thought hard enough about the issue.
