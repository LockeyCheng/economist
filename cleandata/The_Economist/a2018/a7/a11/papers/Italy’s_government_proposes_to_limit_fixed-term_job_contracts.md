Italy’s government proposes to limit fixed-term job contracts

A new law reverses recent reforms and highlights the government’s split personality

SO INGRAINED is the dream of the “

” in Italian culture, that the highest-grossing film of 2016 was a comedy about a man who stops at nothing to keep his permanent job in the country’s public bureaucracy. A series of reforms in recent years has liberalised Italy’s labour market. On July 2nd the government introduced legislation which changes tack.

The “dignity decree” aims to limit the prevalence of short-term job contracts and of firms shifting jobs abroad and simplifies some fiscal rules. (It also bans advertising of gambling, except for government-run lotteries). Businesses are livid; unions have offered mild praise. But the real impact on the job market may be less than its political effect.

The reform is the first big bit of legislation by the month-old government, an uneasy coalition between the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, and Matteo Salvini’s right-wing League. It is the brainchild of Mr Di Maio, minister of economic development and labour, who hailed it as the “Waterloo of job insecurity”. Mr Salvini, the interior minister, whose focus is on blaming immigrants for Italy’s ills, skipped the cabinet meeting at which the law was approved. He instead attended Siena’s Palio, a treacherous horse race around the medieval town’s central piazza.

Confindustria, Italy’s main business lobby, has decried the law, lamenting that firms are “paying the price of an endless electoral race”. The bill reduces the maximum duration and number of renewals of short-term contracts, and increases their cost to employers. It also reintroduces an obligation on firms to justify their renewal. Besides that, it imposes fines on firms which, having benefited from state subsidies or other incentives, leave Italy within five years; and it simplifies minor aspects of the tax system.

Michel Martone, a professor at Rome’s LUISS University and a former vice-minister of labour, suggests that the fiscal and anti-gambling reforms are laudable. But penalising firms that move and the use of fixed-term contracts—which account for around 15% of employment, in line with the European average—risks discouraging firms from hiring and investing in Italy. Unemployment stands at 10.7%, the lowest level since 2012 but still the third-highest rate in Europe; youth unemployment is at 31.9%. Rather than helping to reduce this, the legislation will merely lead to a rise in lawsuits, Mr Martone predicts.

Better, he says, is a government initiative to bring together unions and food-delivery companies to negotiate better rights for “riders”. It is these workers in the gig-economy who need to be given more dignity, argues Vittorio De Luca, an employment lawyer.

Alberto Castelvecchi, also of LUISS, suggests that for all the rhetoric, the proposed reform does not touch the substance of the job market. “It is more political and tactical than economic and substantial,” he notes. It is milder than the original version, and may still be modified by parliament, which must approve it within 60 days. On July 4th Mr Salvini said the law was “a good start, but parliament will make it even more efficient”.

A month in, Messrs Di Maio and Salvini continue to focus on their own constituents rather than on governing together. This strategy will get harder in the autumn when discussion turns to the budget. Reconciling the government’s split personality may then prove an endeavour more treacherous than the Palio.
