The EU digests Britain’s new Brexit plan

The Irish border remains the biggest obstacle to a deal

THE reaction in the rest of the European Union to the Chequers proposals this week was muted, partly because of the political turmoil in Britain and partly because the EU was waiting to see the details in the government’s Brexit white paper, which is due to be published on July 12th. But European negotiators are relieved that Theresa May seems finally to have acknowledged that Brexit implies trade-offs. They have something to get their teeth into when talks resume next week, and especially when ministers from across the EU convene to discuss Brexit on July 20th.

That will be the first test for Britain’s proposal to, in effect, retain membership of the EU single market for some traded goods. The European Commission insists that the single market’s freedoms are indivisible. Not every government may take such a tough line. Some are less wedded to ensuring that their workers retain the right to move to Britain after Brexit than is often realised. A bigger concern is ensuring that deregulation in Britain does not undercut European firms.

Yet officials say the Chequers proposal is unlikely to fly as it is. The British request still looks like cherry-picking. In sophisticated manufactured products, the relative value of goods and services, such as maintenance contracts, are often tricky to disentangle. Who would determine which products would fall under Britain’s proposed “common rule-book”? And there are questions over governance of the proposed arrangement. Some in Brussels argued for shooting down the goods-only proposal even before it was agreed at Chequers.

Nor do Britain’s nightmarish politics help. Some Tory politicians have said that Chequers represents the limit of the concessions they can accept. The EU has no wish to see Mrs May toppled. The concern is that having battled so hard to convince her cabinet to unite behind a softer form of Brexit, shedding ministers along the way, it will be impossible for the prime minister to make the necessary further concessions.

The EU has two possible tactics. One is to adopt the right tone. Its objections to Chequers will be carefully telegraphed and discreetly expressed in order not to hand further ammunition to Mrs May’s enemies. The second is to delay. Britain’s withdrawal agreement, which is supposed to be signed in October or soon afterwards, need cover only the principles of the future trade and migration relationship. The details will be negotiated after Britain has formally left the EU next March, by when the political temperature may have cooled.

Amid all the talk about the future relationship, a more urgent issue is being overlooked. Last December Mrs May agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory and customs alignment with the EU unless another way could be found to forestall a hard border with Ireland. But to conclude the withdrawal treaty, Britain and the EU must agree on language that gives this “backstop” legal form. And that looks hard. Mrs May reiterated to Parliament this week that she would not accept regulatory divergence between Britain and Northern Ireland, implying that the backstop must apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. But the EU fears that would allow Britain partial membership of the single market via the back door.

Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, has tried to defuse the issue by arguing that stepping up existing checks on goods at ports and airports between Northern Ireland and the mainland hardly amounts to erecting a border in the Irish Sea. But that claim is unlikely to sway this British government, or any other. The two sides are stuck. Without a deal on the backstop there can be no withdrawal treaty, and Britain will tumble off the Brexit cliff edge on March 29th 2019. This, more than anything else, should concentrate minds.
