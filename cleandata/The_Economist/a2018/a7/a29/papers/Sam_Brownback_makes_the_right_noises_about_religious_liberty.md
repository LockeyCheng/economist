Sam Brownback makes the right noises about religious liberty

A gathering in Washington, DC this week carried a message of hope

WHEN Americans in high places sound the trumpet for global religious liberty, a sceptical world often wonders whether their main concern is the freedom of their own particular brand of faith or liberty in purer sense, covering all manner of beliefs and non-beliefs. 

Such questions were in the air this week as President Donald Trump’s administration organised an eye-catching diplomatic event in Washington, DC: a three-day “Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom” which brought together foreign ministers and champions of faiths from over 80 countries. 

The host was a former Republican senator, Sam Brownback, who is now the State Department’s ambassador for religious liberty. Along with other members of the Trump team, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Vice-President Mike Pence, he took office amid concerns (or hopes) that he would promote conservative strains of Christianity rather than freedom in general. At a minimum, all these people are on the receiving end of pressure from evangelical lobbies with easy access to the White House.

But in fairness to this week’s gathering, it gave plenty of attention to the grievances of non-Christian groups, including the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar and the Uighur Muslims of north-western China. Whenever reference was made to the travails of Christians in northern Iraq, it was always emphasised that other ancient faith groups, such as the Yazidis, were suffering similar travails.

“We were as inclusive as possible because we wanted to include everyone of every faith or [of] no faith at all,” said Mr Brownback. “Religious freedom really, truly, is for everyone. It’s a right given by God and it’s a beautiful part of our human dignity.”

Among the showcased speakers was an Uighur Muslim who said the Chinese authorities were imposing “unprecedented restrictions” on his community, including the burning of holy books and the demolition of mosques.

Mark Green, the head of USAID, America’s development agency, used the ministerial to strike a note that was both familiar and contentious. He said that freedom for all kinds of religion was the country’s raison d’etre, the basis of its claim to be a shining “city on a hill”. In slightly different forms, that image from Saint Matthew’s Gospel was used by John Winthrop, the Puritan preacher who sailed from England to America in the 17th century, and then taken up by Ronald Reagan. 

As Mr Green put it: “[some] 150 years after Winthrop, that same devotion to religious liberty was seen as so central the character of a young America that our founders enshrined it as the first item in the Bill of Rights.” In other words, the constitution’s First Amendment, which bars the establishment of a religion and guarantees the right to practise any religion, was more than a pragmatic compromise: it was a message to the world about America’s intentions.   

The organisers of this week’s conference had much to say about the merits of religious diversity. Mr Brownback, for example, said

That is a splendid and, in the present moment, rather unusual sentiment. But perhaps the best thing America could do to spread the ideal of amicable diversity (in religious and other matters) is to practise it at home.
