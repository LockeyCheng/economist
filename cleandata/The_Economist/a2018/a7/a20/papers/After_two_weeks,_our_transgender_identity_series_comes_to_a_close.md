After two weeks, our transgender identity series comes to a close

Of course our participants have not reached a consensus, writes Helen Joyce, but disagreements are par for the course in a liberal society

In 2016 Deborah Cameron, a feminist and linguist at Oxford University, 

 a “brief history” of the word “gender”. It used to refer primarily to the socially imposed division of the sexes, she explains. “Feminists of my generation understood gender as part of the apparatus of patriarchy: a social system, built on the biological foundation of human sexual dimorphism, which allocated different roles, rights and responsibilities to male and female humans.”

To women who understand the word “gender” thus, being described as a “cisgender woman” (a coinage by analogy with “trans”: “cis” is the Latin prefix for “on this side of”) can be taken to imply that they are content to live within the narrow confines of femininity under the patriarchy: subservient, abused and underpaid. Such women often describe themselves as “gender-critical”, and when a man says he must transition because he “feels like a woman” they deny there is any such feeling. To people who say they must transition in order to match their gender identity, they respond that gender is an externally imposed constraint that can—and should, for everyone’s benefit—be shrugged away.

But, as Professor Cameron goes on to explain, that is no longer what the word “gender” means to everyone. In recent years a new meaning has come to the fore: “a form of identity, located in and asserted by individuals rather than imposed on them from outside”. Gender in this sense is not just distinct from sex; it has no necessary connection to sex, she explains. For people who use “gender” this way, the point of the “cis” prefix is not to indicate that someone likes pink (or blue) and skirts (or trousers), or that a woman accepts sexual assault, mansplaining and discrimination as their lot in life. And when people object to being described as “cis”, it is their turn to bristle. If “trans” people are the only ones who need a qualifier before “woman” or “man”, then everyone else is…what? “Normal”?

At least some women might drop their objections to “cis” if those using it were clear that they are not implying that cis women acquiesce to traditional feminine gender roles. And cis people could perhaps accept that when trans people say they feel “like a woman (or man)” they do not mean anything to do with appearance, hobbies or careers, but are rather expressing an inward sense of which of two broad groups of human beings they belong to.

But even for such a minor issue, compared with the profound disagreements regarding trans identities in society at large, the conversations that might lead to such rapprochement are rare. Positions have become entrenched. On this topic, and others contested in the culture wars roiling America and Europe, it is common for all concerned to believe that those who disagree with them are necessarily ignorant, evil or arguing in bad faith.

That is what we have sought to counter in the past two weeks. Our participants (see below) have been generous with their time and intellect. They have been brave, too, exposing themselves to disagreement and criticism, and stepping into a debate where many claim there should be none. We would have liked to have more transgender participants, but it was hard to find those who were willing. To those who did participate we owe a special thanks. 

Of course our contributors have not reached a consensus. But disagreements are par for the course in a pluralistic, liberal democracy—indeed, necessary for robust policymaking. Their responses to each other have been civil and enlightening. That this discussion has been possible, and that so many readers have engaged with it, are matters for optimism.
