Through the noise of the decision in America’s Supreme Court to uphold President Trump’s travel ban, and the deliberation over Justice Kennedy’s replacement, one of the most important antitrust rulings in recent years slipped past largely unnoticed. In  Ohio v American Express , the Court ruled in favour of American Express, allowing it to prevent merchants from “steering” consumers away to cheaper payment methods such as cash, Visa or Mastercard.

The case might seem anodyne but it touches on one of the biggest challenges facing competition policy practitioners today: how to deal with firms serving two distinct groups of customers. As digital platforms become increasingly pervasive and powerful, ensuring that they act fairly is a crucial matter.

American Express provides a service both to merchants and consumers: receiving and processing payments for merchants, and providing payment methods to consumers. Traditional analysis, which considered only the direct effect on merchants, implied anti-competitive behaviour. American Express’s anti-steering practices raise the price paid by merchants. However, Justice Clarence Thomas’s judgement acknowledged the positive feedback effects between merchants and consumers, which implied that American Express’s conduct did not in fact violate federal antitrust law. 

The Court recognised American Express as a ‘two-sided platform’, a company that brings together two distinct groups of customers, for each of which the value of the service increases as the size of the other group increases. The value placed on the service by American Express cardholders is relative to the number of merchants that accept the card, and vice versa.

A platform is required to internalise these indirect network effects and facilitate the transaction. The platform’s optimal pricing structure recognises these interdependencies to bring both sides to the market. This analysis can offer a great deal to competition policy more broadly.

Platform industries are not new. Newspapers serving readers and advertisers, and banks serving borrowers and depositors, have been around for centuries. Yet the rising prominence of these platforms, particularly digital ones, has been impossible to ignore. As these companies spread into other markets and new ones emerge, this dominance is only set to rise. From Elizabeth Warren on the left to Ted Cruz on the right, concerns about these tech titans have been mounting. The regulation of the platforms will be critical to the performance of the modern economy. 

The behaviours of a two-sided platform towards the two groups of customers are inseparable. For example, a search engine serves both advertisers and consumers. The more consumers, the more valuable the platform is to advertisers, yet adverts incur a cost to consumers. These network effects are addressed by charging a fee per click to advertisers, and the search engine provided for free to consumers below marginal cost. Focusing exclusively on the advertiser side of the market would miss these important feedback effects leading to a biased judgement concerning competition. 

Fears that  Ohio v American Express  will cement the dominance of these tech giants, by providing effective immunity from competition regulation, are misplaced. The feedback effects may be positive or negative, such that consideration of both sides will not necessarily be favourable to the platform in question.

Nonetheless, difficulties remain. This shift in protocol risks creating a dichotomy open to manipulation by digital platforms: any firm may be able to present itself under the guise of a two-sided platform given a slippery definition. Yet building a regulatory framework from Jean-Charles Rochet’s and Jean Tirole’s original, less flexible, definition of two-sided platforms (emphasising the importance of indirect network effects and an influential pricing structure) will mitigate this problem. 

For example, a firm in a vertical supply chain is not a two-sided platform. A distributor may trade with both an upstream manufacturer and downstream retailer yet it does not provide a platform to link these two sides. In contrast, an equity exchange like Nasdaq provides the infrastructure for buyers and sellers to meet, without which a trade would not occur.

A firm may even use both strategies: Amazon Marketplace is a two-sided platform, connecting third-party sellers and consumers, but when buying new books at a wholesale price and selling at a retail price, Amazon operates as a single-sided company. This notion poses challenges akin to those of “market definition” in traditional antitrust. Difficult practicalities certainly do not justify disregarding feedback effects entirely.   

As Diane Coyle, a British economist, has made clear, current competition policy is inadequate to assess the behaviour of two-sided platforms. The canonical rules of competition policy—price equals marginal cost in competitive markets and marginal revenue equals marginal cost in imperfectly competitive ones—no longer apply when considering one side in isolation.

The feedback effects between sides means the optimal price (both privately and socially) on one side may be below marginal cost or even negative. The strategy of OpenTable, an online restaurant-reservation company, of charging restaurants $1 per diner but the consumer nothing, reflects the skewed pricing structures seen across these platforms.

Until now, antitrust law has worked within the framework of Robert Bork’s book, The Antitrust Paradox, and the Chicago School, focusing almost exclusively on price as a measure of consumer welfare. When considering a platform, this narrow approach will be misleading.

The traditional tools of competition analysis—such as the so-called “SSNIP test” that looks at a “small but significant” price rise—are no longer valid. And even if adapted, they are essentially impossible to implement given the complexity of feedback effects. The price structure, as much as the price level, is a critical feature of two-sided platforms, yet this will be ignored when analysing one side in isolation.  

 Ohio v American Express  is not a silver bullet; there is much more work to be done to tackle the increasing concentration of the digital economy. There are some examples of Schumpeterian competition at play as a platform is supplanted by a new firm with a superior business model or product. Facebook overtook MySpace as the main social media platform and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer is no longer the dominant web browser.

However, the consolidation of digital markets provokes concern. Facebook and Google secured 84% of the global online ad market excluding China last year, and Facebook raised its average price per ad by 43% in the fourth quarter of 2017. High market concentration may be efficient in some cases to exploit economies of scale and network effects, but some signs are cause for concern.

This competitive process can only occur with low barriers to entry, allowing a new entrant to compete on equal footing with an established incumbent. A key problem with this is somewhat unique to digital platforms: high entry barriers are increasingly generated by the monopolisation of data.

Envelopment strategies, where a platform moves into other platform industries—exemplified by many of Google’s functions and Amazon’s recent acquisition of PillPack— generate opportunities for cross-subsidisation and data aggregation, cementing competitive advantages. The same is true with a deterrence of switching, such as Facebook making it impossible to transfer data to another network.

The policy solution is not forthcoming. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is quickly establishing a global standard in data portability rights, but this fails to address the competition issues relating to data asymmetry. Regulated access to the anonymised data of dominant firms has been floated as a way to reduce this asymmetry, but lacks practical implementation. While common access to Google’s historical data may reduce entry barriers, sufficient anonymisation to protect privacy would undermine any challenge to Google’s personalised search algorithm.

Deeper structural reforms are needed that protect privacy, according to Susan Athey, an economist at Stanford. To accomplish this, policies can be ex ante, like limiting envelopment or re-evaluating merger criteria, or they can be ex post, such as limiting data linkages and stricter privacy oversight.

Antitrust law and structural reforms may go some way, yet Jason Furman of Harvard University appropriately advises of the need to be “humble” about the scope of policies to address the wider economic problems seen across the major economies.  Ohio v American Express  demonstrates the risks to effective policy if the issues of competition and inequality are conflated.

If merchants pass on the anticipated higher fees in the form of higher prices to all consumers, this will exacerbate inequality, benefitting only higher-income American Express cardholders. However, overturning the ruling in light of this fact would be counter-productive, and public policies such as government support and tax reform are far more suitable.

A changing industrial landscape and emergence of digital platforms have created more questions in competition analysis than, at present, have sufficient answers. The lack of a coherent practical framework to analyse two-sided platforms is one such question. The major economies have a competition problem—a systematic framework for the nascent and mighty digital platform businesses, building on  Ohio v American Express , is critical to changing that.
