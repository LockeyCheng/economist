Intolerance against intolerance? Moral integrity or a rejection of free speech? Several speakers have pulled out of  The Economist ’s Open Future Festival, held on September 15th in Hong Kong, London and New York. Yet others have decidedly not.

We invited all the participants who withdrew to explain their reasons, out of respect for their positions and the value of free speech. At the same time, some speakers wished to explain why they deliberately chose to attend. The contributions we’ve so far received are below; we will post others as they arrive.

 Why I have withdrawn from speaking where Steve Bannon is participating 

 From Emmy the Great, musician: 

The Open Future Festival is an event I have been longing to see in Hong Kong, and it was a dream to be a part of it.

When I read that Steve Bannon would participate in New York, my first thought was “How do I convince myself to do the event anyway?” I went through every possible reasoning, and sat with the editor’s letter.

The message of the festival, to me, is that we are all connected, and so I could not tell myself that what happens in New York does not affect us in Hong Kong.

I worried that not speaking up would be inaction that I would regret later in life, after his dangerous ideas had proliferated further, and that performing as planned would be tantamount to helping him build respectability and mainstreaming his ideas. One friend said that inviting him to speak was treating his politics like an intellectual exercise, rather than the real threat that they are, and I agreed. Steve Bannon is a white supremacist, who has agitated for war in the South China Sea and is now seeking to cause chaos in Europe.

Since withdrawing, I have been called a bully online. It is interesting that a musician could be accused of bullying a former White House chief strategist, who has enough money to wear two shirts at the same time. But we are going through a period of history when everything is up for redefinition. That’s why the decisions we make are extra important, and even people like me, who are not used to having to make them, must.

It was depressing to boycott, but the festival is about the future. When I think about the future, and what he may come to symbolise, I get scared. I don’t want to live in fear, and I don’t want to feel powerless. All I had on my side was action. I thought about the comfy chairs they have at these events, and the low tables with fizzy water. I don’t want to be the person who helped Steve Bannon get fizzy water. I don’t even want to serve him tap.

 Why I have withdrawn from speaking where Steve Bannon is participating 

 From Monica Ramirez, lawyer and social activist: 

I was a teenager when I found my voice for the first time. I made the decision to question why the local newspaper did not have more media content about and for agricultural workers in my hometown. This was the beginning of what has been over two decades of asking questions, speaking out and taking public stands on issues that impact farmworkers, women, children and many others across communities. Much like during my teenage years, last week I asked questions and took a stand when I became aware that I was in the speaker’s line up with Steve Bannon for  The Economist ’s 175th anniversary event, the Open Future Festival, in New York.

 The Economist  kindly asked me to speak about TIME’S UP and the gender justice work that I have been doing for many years with and for farmworker women in the US. I was deeply honored to be part of this discussion, but I made the decision to withdraw when I learned that Steve Bannon would be speaking as well. Making the choice not to speak at an event that is so important and will be viewed by so many people was a big decision, but it was not a hard one for me to make.

The suffering in the eyes of the immigrant mothers and children who have been impacted by Bannon’s actions, not to mention the hurt and harm against other groups of individuals because of who they are, the religious views they hold and the countries where they were born, made it a very easy decision for me to withdraw. Many people in this country might think that farmworker women or an activist, like me, do not have much power. But, power comes in many forms and can be exercised in a multitude of ways. Among these, power resides in the ability to decide when to speak, where to speak and with whom we speak alongside. Last week when I withdrew from speaking at  The Economist ’s event, I exercised this power.

I believe in having critical conversations, challenging our own thinking and trying to reach common ground, which is what  The Economist ’s Open Future Festival seeks to accomplish, but I also believe that there are times when trying to have reasonable conversation with people who have made abundantly clear that there is no room to negotiate can have a negative impact and actually result in ceding ground and harming the communities that we seek to uplift.

There is a saying in Spanish, “dime con quién andas y te diré quién eres” (tell me who you walk with, and I will tell you who you are). When my community thinks about me, my work, my voice and the spaces that I am choosing to occupy to lift our priorities, issues and contributions, I do not want there to be any confusion about where or with whom I stand. I stand on the side of love, tolerance and justice. I also stand in my power to choose when, where, and in what company to use my voice for good.

 Why I chose to speak where Steve Bannon is participating 

 From Julissa Arce, author: 

I did not make the decision to speak at  The Economist ’s Open Future Festival, where an openly racist, xenophobic man, who espouses views that are dangerous to my community, easily or without reflection. I have no illusions that his interview with Zanny Minton Beddoes,  The Economist’ s editor-in-chief, will expose him or his views as racist or vicious: we already know that they are.

White nationalists like Steve Bannon would like to see an America without people like me, outspoken Mexican-American women. Their so-called “movement” does enough to try to silence us. I decided to attend the conference, despite public opinion that I should pull out, because I will not allow the presence of a racist to scare me or silence me. I will take up space. I will speak my truth.

The “Open Borders: Has Immigration Gone Too Far?” panel where I will be speaking features three guests; Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS); Michael Clemens of the Centre for Global Development (CGD) and me. CIS is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Former managers at CIS are now in key posts within the Department of Homeland Security, and are  quietly driving  President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. Mr Clemens of CGD is an ally of mine, and I am thankful he is on the panel. 

However I am the only person speaking in this session who was an undocumented immigrant. I am the immigrant that groups like CIS find so scary and dangerous to America. I want to be on the same stage as them, and I want to speak for myself. I want to share my story with  The Economist  audience. I might be the first actual formerly undocumented immigrant that they hear from, and I take pride in this fact. I will not let CIS or Steve Bannon take away an opportunity for me to speak up for my community.

 Why I chose to speak where Steve Bannon is participating 

 From Andrew McLaughlin, technologist:  

It's a mistake for  The Economist  to give Steve Bannon stage time at its Open Future Festival.

As  The Economist  reports and editorialises every week, the foundational institutions and norms of liberal democracy are eroding under a sustained and determined assault.  From Hungary and Poland to the Philippines to America, the forces of illiberalism—the authoritarians, the nativists, the nationalists, the racial supremacists, the kleptocrats—are resurgent. The once unthinkable—autocratic rule, politicised courts, racialist policies—is now happening. This requires a sustained and determined defence by all those who believe in democratic governance, individual liberty and equality under the law.

A crucial element of that defence is the reassertion of basic social and political norms. Free speech doesn't mean a free spotlight for every extremist. There is a reason why  The Economist  will not invite the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan or the leader of the American Nazi Party to a tough, skeptical interview by its editor-in-chief on the stage of the Open Future Festival: Their racist/nativist/anti-democratic positions are irretrievably hostile to our multi-ethnic, democratic society. We deny them participation in conventional political discourse—op-ed pages, candidate debates, conference panels—not because we are hypersensitive enforcers of political correctness, but because they are explicitly dedicated to destroying the very institutions, norms, and practices that, however imperfectly, define what's good about this country. Treating racist extremists as pariahs is not just an expression of our revulsion at their views; it is a necessary tactic in defending our liberal democratic order against those who aim to gain power within our systems only to replace them with something horrific.

So if we accept that there are limits, that there must be norms of baseline political acceptability, and that defenders of liberal democracy—even those like  The Economist  that are constitutionally devoted to free speech and fearless dialogue—are wise to reflect those norms, the question about whether to give Steve Bannon a prominent, one-on-one Festival interview is this: Are Bannon’s views and agenda beyond the spectrum of acceptable politics? Is Bannon closer to the KKK and the American Nazi Party than he is to Mitt Romney and Ted Cruz?

For me, this is easy: Bannon is a ringleader of the racist alt-right, a repellent collection of white supremacists, nativists, misogynists, and unabashed anti-Semites. He is a fringe, bigoted pseudo-intellectual who has tasted power and, defenestrated, is now scrambling to find new audiences for his illiberal, racist agenda in Europe. As an important journalistic norm-setter,  The Economist  should relegate Bannonism to the same ideological bucket as the KKK, and not dignify it via a marquee editor-in-chief interview.  Unworthy of even a stubbornly contrarian institution like  The Economist , affording Bannon a mainstage spotlight strikes me as a conference version of clickbait.

So why am I not canceling out of the Open Future Festival? Simply that my presence on stage will give me a chance to express these views. Since  The Economist  has (wrongly, in my view) made clear they’re not disinviting Bannon, I’ll show up to make the case for a renewed norm against normalizing racist authoritarians. And then we’ll talk tech policy.
