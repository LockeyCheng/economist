The age of ideological struggle failed to end with the Cold War.  Francis Fukuyama, who coined the phrase “the end of history”, talks to Anne McElvoy about the rise of identity politics, whether there is any force that can rival it, and which party is playing the identity game better in the American midterms.   Music by Chris Zabriskie, “Divider” (CC by 4.0 UK)
