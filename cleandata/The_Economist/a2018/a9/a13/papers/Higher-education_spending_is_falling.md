OECD countries spent an average of 5% of GDP on education in 2015. Between 2010 and 2015 total spending fell in more than two-thirds of countries surveyed, as belts tightened after the financial crisis. The private sector is playing an increasingly important role: its share of education spending rose by 11% across all OECD countries in that period. The private sector is particularly important to tertiary-level education—especially in America, where almost two-thirds of spending is accounted for by households and private institutions. Things are different in Scandinavia. In Norway, 1% of total tertiary-education spending, or under 0.1% of GDP, came from private sources.
