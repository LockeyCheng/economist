It’s not just accusations of sex discrimination in recruitment they should worry about

YESTERDAY Gulliver  wrote about SpiceJet , an Indian airline that has been accused of sexism when recruiting cabin crew:

The “careers” webpage of SpiceJet, an Indian low-cost airline, begins with language that could be on any corporate recruiting website... But scroll down to the requirements for applicants to the flight-attendant positions, and the tone changes. The job title is “cabin crew/flight attendant (female).” Under “eligibility criteria”, the page specifies that applicants must be between 18 and 27 years old (though it notes that this requirement can be “relaxed for experienced crew”), at least 155cm tall, and of a weight “in proportion to height”. Candidates must also be unmarried, “with an unblemished complexion and good body language.” The job description, first spotted by Katherine Fan at The Points Guy blog, makes blatantly explicit what is already quite clear: that flight attendants, particularly in some parts of the world, are expected to conform to a specific notion of sexual attractiveness, and that their jobs depend on their ability to do so.

But the issue might be the top of the list of concerns of Indian aviation executives at the moment. As an article in this week’s print issue points out, the sector has headed into a sea of red ink this year:

Airlines stocks have fallen even as Indian shares have performed decently overall (see chart). On August 14th SpiceJet, India’s fourth-largest carrier, announced a surprise loss of $5m in the second quarter. A month earlier IndiGo, India’s largest airline, posted a 97% year-on-year decline in net profits for the same period. And in June the government abandoned its planned privatisation of Air India, the flag carrier which has lost money for a decade and is saddled with $7.8bn in debt, after it attracted no bidders.
