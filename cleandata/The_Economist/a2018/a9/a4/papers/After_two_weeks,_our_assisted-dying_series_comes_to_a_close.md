After two weeks, our assisted-dying series comes to a close

Debates over right-to-die legislation will continue to rage, but we hope to have enriched the discussion with balanced, thoughtful contributions in our series

FEW topics are as universal and as specific as death. Perhaps because of this, debates over what constitutes a “good death” can become emotionally charged, free of facts and distressing. 

Over the past two weeks, we have tried to buck this trend. In the first week of our assisted-dying series, 15 contributors  wrote  thoughtful, passionate, and considered articles on why they either support or oppose the notion of assisted dying (that is, laws that permit people to choose, under some circumstances, when they can die, usually with medical assistance, as in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Oregon in America). 

In the second week, eight of those who originally took part in the series responded to others, and we had  one  additional submission from an organisation that opposes assisted dying.  Emilie Yerby , a politician in Guernsey, wrote that although her views against assisted dying did not change, she was still struck by some of the contributors that advocated for it, including an  anonymous  piece  written by a terminally-ill patient.

This spirit of open, respectful debate could also be glimpsed in the many e-mails we received from readers on both sides of the argument. One reader who opposes assisted dying (or euthanasia, as they put it), wrote that “I do believe that life is precious, that everyone should receive help/treatment/support when illness prevents much of the joy that should be part of life. I also believe that easy access to being killed combined with a public discourse that makes killing oneself a virtue makes governments and health systems extremely reluctant to put resources into palliative care. Therein lies one of the problems—when palliative services are deliberately withheld those who say that pain is intractable and uncontrollable are largely right.”

Many people wrote in with personal experiences of witnessing family members die, whether in hospitals, hospices, or right-to-die organisations. These accounts were incredibly moving, and we are very grateful for everyone who took the time to get in touch. 

Susan Strong described the agonising experience of watching her 31-year-old daughter die of a rare, untreatable cancer in Britain, where assisted dying is illegal:

The cancer had spread from her eye to her neck and spine and was progressing rapidly to her brain. She chose to be sedated until her death. However, the dose of medication that the medical staff were legally allowed to give her could only be increased incrementally each day. She remained conscious and in unbearable pain for four days and eventually died on day five. This was not only agonising for her but extremely distressing for the family and the medical staff who were administering the medication. I am still traumatised by her death and how she suffered. I am at pain to understand the difference of administering an increased dose of medication daily or giving a lethal dose on the first day to alleviate the suffering that my daughter underwent. I wholeheartedly support the right of the patient to chose to end their life when life is unbearable and your prognosis is terminal. 

Rohin Francis, a doctor in London, also wrote in to advocate for assisted dying, having seen his mother’s death from motor-neurone disease: “For a year I watched, at every clinic appointment and home review, as she asked her doctors in vain whether they would help her die when her suffering became too great....Her doctors could only respond by saying they would offer palliation and were unable to give her the reassurance she craved. Perhaps her care would've been no different at the end, but to have the option of [assisted dying] available would spare terminally-ill patient needless anxiety and bring comfort to so many.”

Pauline Carroll, a retired district nurse in Britain, wrote in to respond to  Ilora Finlay’s  article to argue that there “will never be enough funding” to ensure decent palliative care. “The belligerent intolerance exhibited by those in palliative care who are supposed to be compassionate is doing more harm to our society than having a safeguarded assisted dying law,” she argues.

Similarly, Caroline Villar wrote that: “I have witnessed three loved ones die. Two chose to starve...and one chose to try to take an overdose due to the insufferable pain, regardless of the fact that she was receiving the very best palliative care. Perhaps elderly people ‘gently ebb away’ but young bodies fight death leading to terrible suffering. It is these distressing cases where there needs to be the ability to choose to die without suffering and pain.”

Meanwhile Robert Goldbach wrote in to say: “I am an intelligent octogenarian experiencing no pain or debilitating disease who believes in God and has tried during my life to do what I consider is good. I certainly wish to go on living as long as I can be supportive of my wife of sixty years but apart from that I see nothing meaningful to be gained by living longer. I fear only the pain of death and not death itself….Why should gruesome suicide be my only option? I don’t want to be remembered that way and I certainly don't want to experience suicide!”

Debates over right-to-die laws will continue: although increasingly it seems that both members of the public, and medical practitioners, are in favour of the idea of giving someone more autonomy over their own death. We hope that, as part of our Open Future initiative, we have contributed to the discussion in the spirit of open and considered debate.
