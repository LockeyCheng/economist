TO MARK  The Economist ’s 175th anniversary, our writers and our audience have collaborated on a collection of briefs called “Liberalism’s greatest thinkers”.  This is now available to download. 

Liberals are in the market for new ideas. For roughly 30 years, they ran the world. Starting in the early 1980s, free markets, globalisation and individual freedoms flourished. Liberalism—in this broad, classical sense, rather than the narrow, American, left-of-centre one—saw off communism as well as social conservatism.

Then, in the crash of 2008, it all fell apart. The financial crisis unleashed economic austerity and the rise of populism. Liberals, in charge of government and the banks, got the blame. They have been paralysed ever since.

One source of new ideas is the past. The offerings of old liberal thinkers still hold lessons; it is the job of this collection of briefs to highlight them.

Our writers have produced six essays on the great liberal thinkers of yesteryear, from libertarians such as Robert Nozick to interventionists such as John Maynard Keynes. To supplement these pieces we share a reading list of 11 more liberal thinkers and their most important works, which has been augmented by the suggestions of our readers. In six weeks, we received nearly 900 responses, suggesting over 300 different thinkers, from readers all around the world. The most popular names ranged from philosophers and politicians, to columnists and poets.
