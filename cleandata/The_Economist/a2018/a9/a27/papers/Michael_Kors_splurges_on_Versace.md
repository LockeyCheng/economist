THE style and story of Versace, an Italian fashion house, are marked by opulence and drama, on and off the catwalk. Liz Hurley, a British starlet, shimmied down the red carpet in a Versace dress held together with golden safety pins in the 1990s. Later that decade, Gianni Versace, the brand’s founder, was gunned down on the steps of his home in Miami.

Versace might seem an odd fit, then, with Michael Kors, an American fashion house at the lower end of the luxury market which is known for its affordable handbags and preppy sportswear. But on September 25th the American brand announced it was buying Versace for €1.83bn ($2.1bn). The Versace family currently hold 80% of the business; the rest is owned by Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm.

Not everyone is convinced by the match. Michael Kors’s share price fell by nearly a tenth on news of the deal with Versace, which was barely profitable last year. Fans of the Italian brand are also sceptical. On Instagram and Twitter, lovers of the fashion house’s baroque style pleaded with Ms Versace not to sell to Michael Kors. “Don’t sell Versace,” begged one person on Instagram. “It will become a tacky brand.” Others dolefully predicted the appearance of Versace items in Walmart and Marshalls, an “off-price” retailer which sells pricey designer labels at drastic reductions.

But Michael Kors’s move is part of its efforts to transform itself into a luxury-brand conglomerate along the lines of big European groups—notably LVMH, which owns Bulgari, Dior and Givenchy, and Kering, home to Balenciaga, Gucci and Saint Laurent. To that end, the American group has recently scaled back the sale of its items at off-price shops.

Along with its purchase of Versace, Michael Kors announced that it was renaming itself Capri Holdings, a moniker inspired by the Italian island and the three towering rocks off its coast. They equate to the three brands upon which the company plans to build its future: Michael Kors itself, Versace and Jimmy Choo, an upscale shoemaker that it bought for $1.35bn in 2017.

It is not the only American firm with designs to become a luxury conglomerate. Tapestry, formerly called Coach, another handbag brand, bought Kate Spade, a posh American handbag designer, in 2017, and Stuart Weitzman, a shoe designer, in 2015. But catching up with the Europeans will not be easy. Capri Holdings will only grow as big as the successes it can produce in future, cautions Luca Solca of Exane BNP Paribas, an investment bank. It is good to have the ambition to emulate LMVH, he continues, but between ambition and achievement, “there is a long stretch of road”.
