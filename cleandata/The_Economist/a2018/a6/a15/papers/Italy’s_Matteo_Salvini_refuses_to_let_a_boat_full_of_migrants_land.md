But Spain steps in

Marine Le Pen reacted with delight, the Vatican with dismay. But it is clear that by closing his country’s ports to a ship loaded with rescued migrants, Italy’s interior minister and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, has notched up a significant, if intensely controversial, vote-winner for the new populist government in Rome.

On June 11th the new Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, invited the MS 

, a rescue vessel operated by a French NGO, to dock at Valencia after it had been refused entry to Italy, resolving the immediate problem. The 

 is carrying around 629 people plucked from the sea off the coast of Libya.

Ms Le Pen, leader of the hard-right National Rally (previously the National Front), welcomed Mr Salvini’s veto, saying that only “a policy of firmness” would halt the mass arrival of migrants. Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the Vatican’s equivalent of a culture minister, tweeted from the gospel of the interior minister’s own namesake, St Matthew: “I was a stranger and you did not invite me in.”

Despite this scriptural attack, Mr Salvini was exultant. “Clearly, raising your voice—something Italy has not been doing for years—pays off,” he declared, claiming “Victory!” Pollsters last week asked voters which of the pledges of Italy’s coalition government, which yokes Mr Salvini’s Northern League to the maverick Five Star Movement (M5S), they were most anxious to see put into effect. The most popular choice, picked by 37% of respondents, was the government’s promised clampdown on illegal immigration. Mr Salvini refused permission for the 

 to dock early on June 10th, as voting began in local elections. The League made impressive gains in them.

Mr Salvini’s tough stance, endorsed by the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, should win the government some room for manoeuvre: it has become increasingly clear that it plans to implement only gradually some of its more vote-catching undertakings, including tax cuts and a new benefit for the poor and unemployed. The blocking of the 

 also sent a message to the rest of the EU that Italy is no longer prepared to shoulder the burden of dealing with migration in the central Mediterranean.

It was a warning too to those in Libya who can influence the flow of migrants and refugees not to try to use them as leverage. In the final months of the previous coalition government in Rome, the number of people arriving in Italy from north Africa fell dramatically because of a shadowy deal, apparently involving financial inducements, with the UN-recognised government in Tripoli and, reportedly, with some of Libya’s powerful militias. There has recently been renewed growth in the number of migrants leaving Libya, which may be an attempt to ensure Italy’s new administration is as generous as the last.

Given the difficulties of transporting the migrants aboard the 

 to Valencia, almost a thousand miles away, some are to be transported aboard Italian naval and coastguard vessels. But the question that remains unanswered is how far Mr Salvini will take his new policy of non-cooperation. The first indications are that he is prepared to allow the ships of Italy’s own armed forces back into its ports despite the presence on them of migrants. That should resolve the issue of an Italian naval vessel heading for Catania with 937 migrants (and two corpses) aboard.

But there is no sign that he has any intention of lifting his ban on the NGOs’ vessels. He told a press conference in Milan: “[just] as we have raised problems for the 

, so we shall for all the other ships”. This looks like being a tense summer.
