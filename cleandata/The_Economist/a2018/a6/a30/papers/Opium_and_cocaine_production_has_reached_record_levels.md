Production of plant-based illicit drugs has surged in recent years, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Global opium production rose by 65% in 2017, to 10,500 tonnes, the highest level since records began. Most of it was grown in Afghanistan, where political instability and rural poverty helps to explain why production reached 9,000 tonnes. Global cocaine manufacture also reached record levels in 2016 (the latest year for which data are available), rising by 25% year on year to 1,410 tonnes. More than half of this amount came from Colombia, where coca-bush cultivation has significantly increased. Unsurprisingly, global drug seizures are also on an upward trend.
