When men rule the board

Companies have some lame excuses for the failure to appoint female directors

ANY teacher will be familiar with the excuses that children give for not performing a task, from grandmothers’ funerals to “the dog ate my homework”. The kids could take some inspiration from Britain’s largest companies, judging by the rationale given for the failure to appoint female directors, as shown by a new 

. Women don’t want “the hassle and pressure” of sitting on a board, they will “struggle with complex issues” and, in any case “all the good women have already been snapped up”. As the eponymous heroine of the film Shirley Valentine remarked “Aren’t men full of shit?” 

Bartleby has a somewhat cynical view of non-executive directors, recalling Tiny Rowland’s dismissal of them as “Christmas tree decorations”. They seem to fall into three camps: friends and acquaintances of the chairman, who will not challenge his authority; worthy public figures, who will not know enough to contest management decisions; and executives from other companies, who might know enough to dissent, but have neither the time nor the inclination to rock the boat.

But if the concept of non-executive directors is to work at all, a diverse range of viewpoints is needed to avoid “groupthink”. And the concept of a shortage of qualified women is a classic Catch-22. If companies don’t appoint any women, they can’t get the experience.

Perhaps the most revealing of the many excuses by board members was “we already have one woman on the board, so we are done”. A paper* by Katherine Milkman and colleagues at Wharton concluded that: “If organizations see gender diversity as a goal but tend to consider that goal satisfied once they match or just surpass the gender diversity levels of peers, then attaining true gender diversity may be jeopardized.”

Many more boards had two female directors than would be expected by chance alone. That may be because the average number of female directors on S&P 500 boards is 1.92, so any company with 2 directors can say it has “more women than average”.

The authors dub this phenomenon “twokenism”.

Clearly, companies are appointing women for show, and not because they think it will add a competitive advantage. Some might argue that this is the market “signalling” that female directors don’t help and is thus a rational decision. However, there are a million reasons why companies may or may not succeed, from the economic climate to technology, and the composition of the board is probably only a small influence. But appointing more women could send a signal to both female employees and customers that the company is an inclusive employer. And there is a chance that female directors might help companies avoid the kind of marketing disaster like Bic's
