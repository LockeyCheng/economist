Seasonal changes in Mars’s air are probably not signs of life. Probably

WHAT little atmosphere Mars has is made mostly of carbon dioxide. It is, however, spiced with a few other ingredients—including, recent studies have claimed, methane. The concentrations are minuscule. But the gas has nevertheless caused excitement among planetary scientists; its presence could be evidence that Mars is not quite as dead as is often supposed, in either the geological sense or the biological one.

On June 7th, in the pages of 

, a team led by Christopher Webster of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a facility in California that does planetary science for NASA, reported the most precise results yet. Instruments aboard Curiosity, a Mars rover, which have been sniffing the air for three Martian years (55 Earthly months), reported an average level of 0.41 parts per billion (ppb). That is a number low enough that it might be explained by the chemical breakdown of the smidgens of organic matter which fall to the surface of Mars in the form of meteoritic dust. Another paper in the same issue of Science provides details of organic molecules in the Martian soil that might have got there in this way.

Intriguingly, though, the concentration of methane appears to vary with the Martian seasons, peaking at 0.65 ppb in the northern hemisphere’s summer and falling to 0.24 ppb in the winter. And it seems to spike as high as 7 ppb. Such intermittency has been seen in Martian methane results before and it has yet to be accounted for.

There are three ways to explain this: it might be a remarkable discovery; a remarkable piece of luck; or a mistake. The remarkable discovery would be that something on Mars is producing quite a lot of methane that lasts for only a very short time in the atmosphere. This would be exciting because only two things make methane on Earth: hydrothermal systems and similar hot forms of geology; and microbes. The presence of methane thus either means that there is as yet unseen geological activity on Mars—or that there are some microbes there.

Exciting though this is, it is also rather hard to believe. Models of the chemistry of the Martian atmosphere suggest that methane can last in it for centuries, rather than being broken down in weeks. As yet there is no good account of how Mars could both be making methane and using it up. One way around this would be luck. Maybe there are just a few very small sources of methane on Mars—and Curiosity is sitting on top of one. When it belches a little methane, the rover detects it, but it fairly soon blows away.

There is also the possibility of error. Perhaps the bit of the instrument which shows seasonal ups and downs is not as well calibrated as the researchers think it is, or there is a source of methane in Curiosity itself that they have not accounted for. NASA, though, has checked and rechecked its systems, and is confident that the rover is not the culprit.

Dr Webster and his team suggest that the methane is probably produced geologically in the depths and then trapped in ices just below the surface. When the relative warmth of the Martian summer warms the ices a little, some methane seeps out. For now, though, no one is sure—so the microbe hypothesis cannot be discounted completely. But Europe is coming to the rescue. On February 20th the Trace Gas Orbiter, a European satellite orbiting Mars, started to study the atmosphere in unprecedented detail. Methane measurements are top of its to-do list.
