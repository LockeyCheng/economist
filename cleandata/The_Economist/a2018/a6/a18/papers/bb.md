USING PDS2 – AN INTRODUCTION

WHAT IS PDS2?
PDS2 stands for Project Delivery System – version 2. It is a web-based application that
primarily manages capital budgets down to a project by project level of detail. It provides
the following functionality:
• Capital Request – a formal request for existing capital funds be allocated to a specific
capital project or equipment purchase.
• Program Change – a request to move (reallocate) funds from one project to another.
• Approvals – automates the funding approval process through multiple levels of review
and sign-off.
• Reports – provides status reporting on budget transactions including commitments and
expenditures.
• Capital Budget Management – includes program change, changing budget status,
adding resources to a budget and adding comments to a budget.
WHO USES PDS2?
Anyone with a UMHHC uniqname and Novell password can use PDS2. There are roles
performed by different types of PDS2 users:
• Requester – anyone requesting capital funding for a project or equipment.
• Department Manager – the person responsible for the funding allocated to a specific
department. The Department Manager may choose to assign a request to the AHD for
review.
• AHD (Associate Hospital Director) – the high level administrator of a department
responsible for approving all capital requests over $150k and allocating incremental
operating funds needed for the capital investment. The AHD also approves Construction
Investigation requests.
• Technical Reviewers – these formalized groups or individuals (information technology
specialists, designers, architects) ensure that the funding requests incorporates all
necessary technical requirements based on the scope of the project/request.
• CBO (Capital Budget Office) – staff responsible for final review of project requests and
PDS2 system administration.
HOW ARE PROJECTS/CAPITAL ACCOUNTS TRACKED IN PDS2?
Each project or equipment request is assigned an RTN or Request Tracking Number, until
the funding allocation request has been approved. Once approved, the allocation receives a
CBN, or Capital Budget Number. From this point on, the CBN is used to refer to the
project/account.
HOW DO I REQUEST CAPITAL FUNDS USING PDS2?
The UMHHC has a formal, annual capital funding request process which typically begins in
October and is usually completed by May. This process establishes the department’s above
threshold (>$300k) projects to be executed in the next Fiscal Year as well as below
threshold allocations for the next Fiscal Year. The department’s below threshold allocation
is a source of funding for capital items costing less than $300k that departments may want
to purchase throughout the year.
Once your department has been allocated capital funds, you must still request that they be
allocated to a specific project, or set up in a specific project budget, in PDS2. These
requests may be made at any time throughout the year. Large projects which are funded at
$300k or higher (above threshold projects) will be automatically entered into PDS2 by the
CBO and can only be requested during the annual capital funding request process. See the
section on Requesting Capital Project/Equipment Funding for more information.

THE PDS2 PROCESS (The Flow Chart Explained)
1. The Requester initiates a request for capital funds allocation in PDS2.
• The Requester may make content changes to the request.
• The Requester may cancel the request.
2. The Requester verifies and submits the request.
3. The Requester confirms the request entry.
• The requester may cancel the request entry.
4. The Department Manager reviews the request.
• The Department Manager may fund the request.
• The Department Manager may disapprove the request.
• The Department Manager may deny it (ask the Requestor to make changes).
o The Department Manager denies the request.
o The Department Manager documents the required changes in the
Comments section of the denial.
o The system places the denied request with comments on the requester’s
PDS2 work list and notifies the requester of the denial by email.
5. The AHD reviews the request.
• If it is $150k or over.
• If request is for use of AHD controlled funds.
• If the Department Manager requests AHD review.
• If the request is for Construction Investigation.
6. The AHD takes action on the request.
• The AHD may approve the request.
• The AHD may disapprove the request.
• The AHD can deny it back to the Department Manager for changes.
o The Department Manager MUST DENY the request back to the requester
for changes or the Department Manager may disapprove it.
7. The appropriate area performs a technical validation.
• Construction
• Interior Design
• IT
8. The Technical Validator verifies or enters detailed cost information on the
request
• The Technical Validator will enter the request detail if it is a construction
investigation or interior design request.
• The Technical Validator notifies the Department Manager of required changes
through the denial process.
o The Department Manager denies the request and the request goes back to
the requester for changes or cancellation (see step 4).
9. The Capital Budget Office reviews the request.
• The Capital Budget Office can disapprove the request.
• The Capital Budget Office can approve the request.
• The Capital Budget Office can deny back to the Department Manager for changes.
The Department Manager denies the request and the request goes back to
the requester for changes or cancellation.
10. If the Capital Budget Office approves the request, the project is funded!
• The system notifies the requester of the new CBN via email. That email contains
instructions to go into PDS2 and review the chartcom information of the new budget.
That chartfield combination is to be used in the purchasing process.
