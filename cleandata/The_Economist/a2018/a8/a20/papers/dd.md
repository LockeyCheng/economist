Want to tell the “cobra” pointed finger from the “starfish” finger flail? Here’s the book for you

ONE by-product of the Trump administration’s extraordinarily high turnover is likely to be a large number of tell-all books from former staffers. The 45th president has only been in office for a year and a half and yet there are already three such books—by Sean Spicer, James Comey and, now, by Omarosa Manigault Newman. The author, who was offered a White House job largely on the strength of her performance in Season 1 of “The Apprentice”, is an authentically Trumpian creature who has known the president for 15 years. This lends her a peculiar kind of expertise. She also taped her firing—by the chief-of-staff, John Kelly, in the White House Situation Room—which was bold.

As befits someone who came to the job through reality TV, in Ms Manigault Newman’s corner of the White House there is no policy, only presentation. The author spends much of her time trying to arrange snaps of people who really do not wish to be photographed with the president. She seems baffled that Trumpworld (her term) does so many things she disapproves of, then pushes back against her colleagues with another photo-op.

Much of the book involves settling scores with Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Mr Trump. If you wish to know whom Ms Manigault Newman sat next to at lunch or on the plane then this is the work for you. The modesty usually expected in an autobiography often proves elusive. “If news got out that I thought the president was delusional or mentally impaired, the impact on national and global stability could be cataclysmic,” she writes. As The Economist went to press, the cataclysm had yet to arrive.

Fortunately there are some funny bits to leaven the prose. Ms Manigault Newman asserts that the president has two beds in his bedroom, one for tanning and one for sleeping. She says that he eats sensitive documents and estimates that he has drunk 43,800 cans of Diet Coke in the time she has known him. Mr Trump’s hand gestures have been remarked on before, but here the author attempts to classify them (the cobra pointed finger; the starfish finger flail).

How much of this is actually true? White House sources have denied the most salacious bits, but then they would deny that the sun rises in the east. “The directive came down from Reince [Priebus, then chief of staff] that our default position was to back up whatever the president said or tweeted, regardless of its accuracy,” she writes. And Ms Manigault Newman may have more tapes.

Amid the craziness, there are moments of insight. “Trump’s greatest character flaw”, she writes of a man whom she considered a mentor and friend for a third of her lifetime, “is his total lack of empathy, which is itself a function of his extreme narcissism.” “If you leave or betray the Trump cult,” she notes, “you are labelled crazy and pathetic.” That part is certainly true. Since publication, the president has provided his own blurb for the second edition. “When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!”
