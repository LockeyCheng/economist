 This is the second week of articles on assisted dying. All of the first week’s articles can be found  here , along with responses from the original contributors. This is an additional article to the series.  

There is huge pressure on British politicians to legalise assisted dying. However, doing so would represent a dangerous change in British criminal law. It would fundamentally alter the relationship between doctor and patient, giving doctors the power to kill as well as cure.

Such immense responsibility would need the strictest of regimes to ensure it would not be abused. Given the stakes involved we must pay careful attention to the practice of assisted dying in other countries and states where it has already been legalised.

What we learn from these places is that the slippery slope is real. It has two distinct elements. First, there is a steady increase year on year in the number of people being killed or helped to commit suicide by their doctors. Second, once assisted dying has been legalised for one category of people, it is only a matter of time before it is extended to others.

In 2002 euthanasia was legalised for adults in Belgium who met certain criteria, the main one being that they must be in “constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain” resulting from an accident or an incurable illness. In 2014 the law was extended to children of any age who were terminally ill. In 2002 just 24 people were euthanised in Belgium. Between 2016 and 17 there were a record 4,337 cases reported to the authorities. In the same year three children were killed by lethal injection. These were the first minors since the law was broadened to include them. 

In Belgium euthanasia is not limited to those with terminal illnesses. People have been euthanised because of a wide range of conditions, including depression, blindness, deafness, gender-identity crisis and anorexia. In 2014 a prisoner serving a life sentence for rape and murder was given permission for an assisted suicide. Although not envisaged in the original law, organ-donation regulations have now been introduced in cases of assisted dying, raising the unsettling prospect of organ harvesting.

The Netherlands also introduced assisted dying in 2002. The figures also show year-on-year increases. In 2017 the total number of euthanasia cases reported was a staggering 6,585, a massive increase from the 1,923 reported in 2006. 

Advocates of legalised assisted dying will point out that the mooted British law is much more restrictive than those in Belgium and the Netherlands. But many of those advocates see the current proposals as a first step, and intend to continue to lobby for an extension to full euthanasia at a later date.

Moreover, even in those jurisdictions where only assisted dying has been legalised, rather than full euthanasia, we see evidence of the slippery slope. In Switzerland, figures from the Federal Statistics Office show that the number of Swiss residents who died by assisted suicide rose from just 43 in 1998 to more than 1,000 in 2015. Similarly, figures from Oregon, where the law covers only people who are expected to live no more than six months, the number of deaths has increased year by year. The latest statistics from the Oregon Health Authority show that in 2016 some 133 people died by assisted suicide.

The statistics from places like Belgium and the Netherlands are shocking enough. But those from somewhere like Oregon surely place an even greater burden of proof on campaigners for assisted dying in Britain. They talk often about safeguards. But how could we ever create a system where the safeguards would work every time and wrongful death would be impossible?
