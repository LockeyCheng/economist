Political rumblings under a volcano on the China-North Korea border


Korean nationalists dispute China’s part-ownership of the sacred mountain

FOR much of the year the lake in the crater at the top of Mount Changbai, a dormant volcano that straddles the frontier between China and North Korea, is covered with ice or hidden by clouds. On a recent weekend its waters, through which the border runs, shone a stunning azure blue. Sightseers on the Chinese side of the peak jostled for elbow-room at a busy cliff-top viewing point, grinning excitedly for selfies. Across the lake, in North Korea, there was not a soul to be seen.

On such a day it is easy to see how the mountain became not just a famous beauty spot but also a potent national symbol. The ethnic Manchus who founded China’s last imperial dynasty, the Qing, claimed that their progenitor was conceived on its alpine slopes. Koreans, who call it Mount Paektu, have a similar myth. In their folklore, the mountain is the birthplace of the founder of the first Korean kingdom. North Korea eagerly exploits the peak’s near-sacred status in Korean culture. It claims that Kim Jong Il, the late father of the country’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, was born in its foothills. The far more likely location was a refugee camp in Siberia.

So whose mountain is it? The debate has seemed mostly settled since the 1960s, when China and North Korea agreed on how to share its nearly 2,750-metre-high caldera. It is unclear, however, whether the two secretive countries have reached a clear-cut agreement on the border line or have simply agreed to fudge it. Nationalist groups in South Korea argue that neither North Korea’s rulers nor the Japanese colonialists, who occupied the Korean peninsula and later north-east China before their defeat in the second world war, had any standing to draw up the boundary. Some South Koreans argue that, if the Koreas reunify, the new country should claim not only the whole volcano, but also Yanbian, a traditionally ethnic-Korean region of China that extends north and east of it.

It is hard to imagine such a realignment happening, especially while watching the endless stream of buses relaying Chinese tourists to and from the peak. In recent years Chinese firms have invested heavily in tourist facilities on their side, including luxury ski resorts. New hotels are still being built and the road to the volcano from Yanji, a city to the north-east, is being improved. The North Korean side is far more dreary. Many of its visitors are pilgrims being taken to pay homage at the supposed birthplace of Kim Jong Il in a guerrilla base used by his father, Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Kim dynasty, for staging attacks against the Japanese. A funicular railway to the summit often does not work because of power cuts, travel agencies warn.

Yet even though China and North Korea appear happy to coexist on the mountain, subterranean rumblings between 2002 and 2005 hint at a risk. An eruption at Changbai in the year 946 was one of the largest volcanic explosions in the past five millennia. Some wonder if another might be due. Volcanologists seem relieved that North Korea has for the moment stopped its underground nuclear tests, which take place in tunnels about 120km from the mountain. A few had started to ponder whether the big bangs could set it off.
