 Welcome to our Open Essay, a new format in which a writer develops an argument in three instalments over the course of a week, in conversation with readers. 

 Part I: August 13th 

To be a feminist is simply to believe that everybody should be treated equally, regardless of sex. It means you think that there should be equality of the sexes economically, socially, politically and personally. When you put it like that, it’s surely difficult for anybody to deny being a feminist. But for such a simple concept, it is often dramatically misunderstood.

Perhaps the most common objection to feminism is the argument that it is unnecessary, because equality has already been achieved. This idea feeds into the common stereotype of feminists as angry, man-hating witches, who must be overreacting since there is no real problem to solve. So how do we convince sceptics that feminism is still necessary and, indeed, valuable?

The easiest place to begin is by disproving the notion that gender inequality no longer exists. This is simple enough. Globally, according to the United Nations,  at least one in three  women is beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused by an intimate partner in the course of her lifetime. In 2016, a UNESCO report  estimated   that over 130m girls worldwide were out of school. And campaign group Girls Not Brides  reports   that each year 12m girls are married before the age of 18.

In Britain, official analysis from the Crime Survey of England and Wales  revealed   that in the 12 months leading up to March 2017 over 510,000 women experienced some type of sexual assault, including an estimated 144,000 who experienced rape or an attempted rape or assault by penetration. A  quarter   of women and  one in two  disabled women in Britain experience domestic violence in their lifetime. Almost  a third  of 16-18 year old girls report experiencing unwanted sexual touching at school. 

It is undeniable that these problems, and a great many more, from wage inequality to so-called “honour” violence, female genital mutilation to workplace sexual harassment, disproportionately affect women. 

It is also easy to demonstrate that women are far from equal when it comes to representation in positions of power and influence. As of 2017  less than a third  of British MPs were women, just a quarter of members of the  House of Lords  and less than a quarter of  judges   in the Court of Appeal and the High Court. More  FTSE 100 CEOs  are called David than are female. The representation of women of colour is particularly low. The  first public statue  of a named black woman in Britain (Mary Seacole) was erected in 2016.

Some sceptics will argue that feminism remains problematic because its true objective is not to achieve equality, but to advantage women at all costs, to the detriment of men. Many fear that focusing on women’s rights means neglecting men’s problems, such as the high male suicide rate. 

Not so. I urge sceptics to take any issue that particularly affects men. It is often closely connected to the sort of outdated gender stereotypes that feminists are committed to tackling.

The tragically high male suicide rate, for example, cannot be divorced from the fact that men are  far less likely  than women to seek support for mental health problems. When we bring men up in a world that teaches them it’s not manly to talk about their feelings, we damage them terribly. And gender stereotypes don’t exist in a vacuum. They are two sides of a coin. In this case, the other side is the common notion that women are over-emotional, hormonal and hysterical; a cliché which disadvantages women in the workplace. Feminists are eager to dismantle these stereotypes, in all their forms. So tackling gender inequality at its root, as feminists seek to do, would help everybody, regardless of sex.

Finally, an argument for the sceptics who don’t oppose feminism, but simply feel that it has nothing to do with them. We can show them that it is not just at an individual level that feminism is in everybody’s interest: at a wider organisational and societal level, too, its benefits are demonstrable.  Research   has  repeatedly   revealed that gender diversity on companies’ boards is correlated with higher productivity growth and returns to investors. And at an international level, the  very best predictor   of a state’s peacefulness is not its level of wealth, its level of democracy, or its ethno-religious identity; but how well its women are treated.

The media often portray any question related to feminism as a battle pitting men against women. “The battle of the sexes.” “Gender wars.” These might be catchy, clickbait headlines, but they give an inaccurate and (sometimes deliberately) misleading impression of the objectives of feminism.

We are often encouraged to win over sceptics by imploring them to think of their sisters, their mothers, or their girlfriends. But really, we shouldn’t need to imply that men are damaged by association when the women attached to them are harassed, discriminated against or assaulted. It should be enough to argue that any woman, related to you or not, deserves equality, and to live a life free of these forms of abuse. Isn’t that reason enough to call yourself a feminist?
