A WORLDWIDE downturn in house prices once seemed unthinkable. The Great Recession of 2008-09 proved that property can lose value precipitously, just like any other asset. But ten years on, homebuyers’ memories appear to be worryingly short. In 35 of the 44 markets in our global cities house-price index, which tracks residential-property values in the world’s most desirable metropolitan areas, prices have surpassed their pre-recession values. In many cases, they have soared to new record highs: after adjusting for inflation, homes in Berlin now cost 82% more than they did at the end of 2007. Those in Hong Kong are worth a whopping 147% more.

Property bulls argue that heady home prices are merely a function of the fundamentals of demand, supply and the cost of credit. The amount of land in the world’s most dynamic cities is fixed, yet thanks to the continuing trends of urbanisation and globalisation, more and more people want to live in them. Moreover, historically low interest rates have enabled prospective buyers to offer sums that would previously have seemed outlandish.

Yet in the long run, prices must bear some relation to incomes: people can only increase the share of their earnings they spend on lodging for so long before they run out of money. And the most cramped cities may be approaching this tipping point: in London, rents average about half of a typical pay-cheque. The share is just one-quarter in the rest of Britain.

To help determine whether rising house prices reflect fundamentals or speculative froth, 

 benchmarks house prices against each city’s median household income. If, over the long run (which we define as 20 years, or more if data are available), housing inflation outstrips the incomes that are able to service a mortgage, then prices are likely to be unsustainable.

On this basis, houses do indeed look substantially over-valued in a half a dozen of the cities we track. Indeed, in a few of these places, including Auckland, London, Sydney and Toronto, prices have begun to fall, albeit slowly. That may well foreshadow a bigger correction to come.
